'I saw a story on the TV about this place and decided to give it a try. It was a good burger. It is bit pricey but oh well. It was juicy and had good flavor and the fries were tasty too. Not reinventing the wheel by any means but my burger tasted good and thats what its all about.',4
'Just like home!!! Now that I have moved far from home its hard to find that home Filipino cooking either its not fresh or the flavors are just off. Gingerroot did a spectacular job their pork was crispy the dinaguan had the right amount of vinegar and the right amount of patis was added to the pancit.',4
'This place is great a true American breakfast joint. It looks as if it is family owned and some of them work here which gives it a small town feel yet it seems to be a pretty popular place in old Downtown Gilbert. Weve been here a few times for Sunday b-fast. The styling of the place is true old-meets-new theme which is pretty cool.   Everything on there menu that weve had seems to be made of quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. The service is generally pretty good weve had less-than-perfect service a couple times but its usually pretty good. They source there sausage products from Shriners locally which is great sausage. Their biscuits and gravy are seriously some of the best you will ever have the Turkey sausage is excellent and if you didnt know it was turkey you would still think it is excellent sausage. The cheesy-potatoes (cant remember what they call them!) are usually amazing but we have noticed some times they are better than others.  My wife enjoys there espresso drinks but they dont offer anything besides whole milk and early on a Sunday we try to keep it light. Their brewed coffee is good as well. The only limitation they may have is the menu there is not much other than basic breakfast combos and omelets which are all great but it would be nice to see sandwiches and other options. They do have an assortment of baked goods which look amazing. They only offer scrambled eggs which I like but my wife likes her eggs over easy and she doesnt get that option.  Overall for a great breakfast experience Liberty Market is one of the best EVER! The only place that may be better is Sugar Shack in Huntington Beach CA. Definitely worth checking out if youre in the east valley.',4
'The good was prompt seating and the chicken fried steak was really good.  Eggs where room temperature waiter never checked in for us to tell him and overall service was poor. Tall lanky guy with the shaved head didnt seem to care. I had to get up to find him for the check. After all the good reviews I was expecting average service. We were thinking of going back again but no chance now. One of the few times I didnt leave a tip.',1
'Let me give you some tips about this place.   First off dont tell my wife I come here she might get mad. But if you did I would just tell her that I only come for the food. Thats what you should tell your wife whenever she gets mad at you for coming here too because its true. They actually have good food. Also you can tell your wife that you just watched sports and fail blogs on TV and didnt see none of those ladies. Because thats true too they have a lot of TVs playing sports and fail blog videos. Also if you buy a calendar or mousepad or something keep that at work...I dont know how to explain that one man.',5
'So its Saturday night and youre looking for a great place to have rattlesnake?  Well this is it!  Besides fantastic steaks etc. they have a really wonderful rattlesnake appetizer.  Tastes kinda like fried calimari.  A little chewy a little crunchy and oh so yummy.  They have a strolling guitar player / singer who will cinch the romantic western Saturday night trying to impress a date evening.  Sit under the stars and palms and just mellow . . .',5
'This is one of my favorite Fox concepts. The atmosphere on the patio during the mild weather seasons is to die for! The service is always incredible.  The break and pesto before the meal is what I look forward to. I can eat just that alone! I am biased towards the veal ravioli mainly because Im a picky eater. It is truly delicious though. The potato and prosciutto flatbread is also a must have.',5
'I want to give CPEC 5 stars due to their customer service.  I visited CPEC thinking that it was part of my eyecare insurance network.  However when I arrived the staff advised me that it wasnt.  My fault I had changed jobs and should have looked at my new networks providers.  Long story short CPEC pro-rated my exam which I thought was more than fair being they could have charged me full-price.  The exam was very thorough and  staff very courteous as well.  Thanks for a great experience and excellent customer service - Ill be back even though youre not in my network!',5
'Wings were delicious.. Waitress was helpful. Just made a quick stop before a concert with my lady. I will definantley try to go back next time im in the area..!!',4
'I went here Saturday night with a party of 7.  It was about 8pm and the place was not that busy.  The owner came up to us right away to greet and seat us.  We were the only gringos in the place so this was a good sign.  Ive only had Korean cuisine a handful of times so Im not that good of a judge when talking about the authenticity or quality of the food.  However everything I had was excellent.  The bbq ribs were bomb and so was my entree.  I still cant pronounce what my entree was but it was rice veggies beef and egg in this 9000 degree pot thing.  It was delicious and reminded me of awesome fried rice.  The best part of this place is the owner HS or Hot Stuff.  He is the most friendly outgoing and energetic Korean guy ever.  It is like dinner and a show with this guy.  Among other things takes saki-bombing to another level and makes it quite an event.  Although a bit pricey for what you get this place is awesome and I cant wait to go back.  Its a fun locally owned small business that puts out some decent and unique food.  Couple that with a character such as Hot Stuff and you cant miss.',5
'Had a great time here! Had only two problems-1) No purse allowed? How am I supposed to dress sexy and have pockets at the same time? Taking away a femmes purse is a federal crime!-2) Really hard to find if you dont know it is in a SHOPPING CENTER! I had never seen a club before in like a supermarket shopping center....but the space is actually quite big!',4
'The Chart House has been a restaurant that has been around for ages (nationally) and unfortunately its starting to show.  This seems to be a place that has grown with its clientele -- those people who come here are the same families that have been coming for years but are now bringing their children and grandchildren.  There is nothing wrong with that (my family has its faves) but I might just be too late attempt to add another.  As such the Chart House while perfectly picturesque and with decent service just isnt a culinary star in Scottsdale.  More specifically my wife and I ordered the coconut shrimp and the blue-cheese/panko crusted asparagus for appetizers.  Admittedly the coconut shrimp was a throw-away dish -- its our go-to at Outback and we had a craving.  The asparagus was a bit different but enjoyable -- it wasnt pretty but it certainly had us talking about it as the high-point afterwards.  The macadamia crusted mahi was simply so-so.  While not bad the fish wasnt flaky and the sauce (peanut something-or-other) was so heavy it masked the mahi flavor.  My wifes ceasar salad had 3 croutons in total on it -- not a deal breaker but it seemed pre-prepared.  But the one thing that customers need to know the prepared cocktails (at ~$10 a pop) and really light on the pours and even lighter on the flavor (e.g. pineapple caipirhana) -- we couldnt justify getting a second drink with the entree.  We had high hopes for this place (we had been to the one in San Diego years ago) and unfortunately it would not be a place we would actively choose to go again.  That being said we wouldnt say no if someone really wanted to go.  In our estimation it was simply an overpriced so-so restaurant.  If it werent for the lovely view I think our night would have underwhelmed completely.',2
'I cant say enough about this steak house Frashers catered to my nephews wedding and the service and food was beyond 5 stars. I recommend everyone wanting fine dining and service to use Frashers for their next event. George and his crew went beyond to see that every detail was the best experience for all guest and the wedding party. The food was the greatest I ever experienced at any catered event Ive attended.',5
'Not my favorite place for karaoke... I find their book to be lacking. Aside from that it seems to be a decent neighborhood bar that draws in an outside crowd. The place is a bit generic but that wont prevent you from having a good time.  The crowd seemed to be younger the times Ive gone - early to mid-20s mostly. The drink prices were reasonable. The bar food was tolerable but greasy.',3
'Wow I saw them on 3TV and was in the neighborhood. I bought a few pies. Yummm! I wasnt crazy about the dessert pies but loved the other pies. I dont like nutmeg thats why i didnt like the fruit. Otherwse I had the ham cheese and egg the spinach quich the pork chili all delcious. Next timeI will buy more to try. The crust was flaky and light but did not fall apart. I am defintely putting my order in for more. It is convenient that you can put in an order and pick it up at one of the farmers markets around the valley.',5
'I love books and I love bargains. Put the two together and you have a place called Bookmans or as I like to call it my book heaven. I recently purchased four books for about $30 -- thats the price of one new hardbound book -- and was thrilled by all the great bargains I found during my casual stroll through the many many isles of books cds and dvds.  What I love about the whole used bookstore concept is being able to give a new life to a book someone didnt want anymore.  I especially get a kick out of finding old books with inscriptions inside. One I found says:         Pam This is my number 1 all time favorite book. I hope you have         a relaxing holiday with your family and look forward to adventures         in the new year!  I felt bad for the inscriber since the book obviously did not become Pams favorite so I bought it in hopes that the inscription would ring true for me.  Im glad a bookstore like Bookmans is around and that they are able to compete with the big chains.  It is a great place to find great deals and Im hooked!',4
'Its cool spot. Came here once. Theres a patio for the smokers parking lot drinks are strong :-) only miller light on tap but carry other bottled beers. Bar tender Wed night was a cool guy. There is also a room with a stage. One toilet per bathroom is a minus and can only imagine crowded nights and waiting.',3
'Went with two friends for appetizers after a movie.  Service was great.  Food was eh.  The Alice Springs chicken quesadilla was good but something I felt you could get anywhere.  Besides chicken and cheese it had mushrooms and bacon with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  The Kookaburra wings not so good.  Dry.  The Blueberry martini was tasty but lacking in alcohol and Im a lightweight these days when it comes to alcohol.',2
'Just tried the Habit for the first time tonight. The burgers were tasty not GREAT but good. The fries were a bit soggy and soft but still tasted good. The atmosphere was clean and the staff was friendly...but...a 30 minute wait on a Thursday night to get my to go order? UNACCEPTABLE!  10 minutes in line and then 20 minutes waiting get my food. For a restaurant of this kind that is just crazy. Not sure if the food was good enough to keep me coming back.',3
'This place I have been hoping and waiting for since I started seening their commercials on TV now that they are here they are my new regular place to go my parents are coming into town this weekend from California and they want to go as they have seen the commercials in California too. So we are going to dinner tonight.',5
'So good here.  So good.  I asked my friend who lives in Phoenix whats a place that is Phoenix and I cant eat anywhere else.  She recommended Ponchos and man I am glad she did.  I had already eaten a bag of Ruffles sour cream and cheddar so my stomach wasnt feeling that great.  But I had to get the pollo fundido and it was amazing.  It was pretty big.  Ok enough about that just know it was amazing.  I am salivating thinking about it.  The chips and salsa was great.  Everything was great.  Go here for some authentic Mexican food.  Yum.',5
'The spa at the Arizona Biltmore Resort http://www.yelp.com/biz/4olxJGHtxb4xIl2TSmDjHg#hrid:Xi5wc0M6zaBeirZ3QEHWkQ is located near the Paradise wing the waterslide and the Catalina rooms.  The closest parking would be the Catalina rooms along the Arizona Canal.  I had booked my spa treatment 6 months out and called to check on it a month out thankfully I did they got the date and time wrong.  I called another time to check on my reservation and it was correct.  I was running late from my flight and they kindly moved my Biltmore Block package from 1pm to 3:00pm on Friday with a couple of hours notice.  My package would take around 3plus hours massage facial manicure and pedicure.  $385.  18% tax and gratuity.  Our dance convention got 30% off of a la carte spa treatments not packages.  The entrance was small with a reception desk but a large retail area of spa products.  You are shown the facility pretty good size with a locker room with lots of bathroom/spa amenities lounge with snacks and drinks (loved their peach flavored signature tea) dry and wet sauna jacuzzi (clothing optional) showers work out room (I didnt take photos I was there to dance and relax not exercise) massage and aesthetician rooms.    The massage room is small and my female masseuse was very attentive and mindful of the cooler room so she had warm blankets to cover me.  The estheticians room was small also she was a little young immature and too chatty for me but I was still pleased with my facial.  For my mani and pedi you leave the spa building and go next door to the end of the Paradise wing where the salon is located.  They have the spa massage chairs for the pedi.  Love them.  One thing they are missing are toe and fingernail dryers but you are on vacation so you take your time finish drying near the pool in your cabana with canana boys running around to do your bidding.  You have to go back next door to the Spa to pay for your treatments at the end.  When you stay as a hotel guest you have access to everything til around 8pm so loved to stop by and fill my waterbottle full of their ice tea and pick up a piece of fruit.  Would have hung out here much more if I didnt have a poolside cabana.  Was very pleased with my treatments and the service.',4
'This is a hidden gem! Ive never seen it as busy as others that I have been to but they are awesome!  The are similar to the other self serve froyo places but I like the layout better than others I have been to.  They always have new flavors and many flavors to choose from.    The toppings bar is an island in the center of the area which allows easy access for multiple people to use it.  Others have a buffet line type set up which keeps the flow of traffic moving but if you want to skip the candy and move to the fruit you are also cutting in line.  With the island set up you can get what you want and get out of there.  Seating is plentiful with many spots outside too.    The quality is good and the place is always clean.',4
'Great event! The food and drinks were awesome cant wait to hit up Outback for happy hour some time soon! Thanks to everyone who came and mingled and made it very entertaining. It was nice to meet a bunch of new people as always and personally I liked the bar atmosphere',5
'Overrated and expensive. When Oceanaire opens at the Biltmore Id gladly drive down there versus Ocean Club.',3
'Great Atmosphere here!  If you like fine dinning with your Mexican food youll love this place!  Youll be greeted by a host or hostess once you walk in. This place has a really nice theme and great style of culture.  You get chips and salsa once you are seated which is really cool. There is three different kinds of salsa with the chips. I really like the green colored one!   I ordered an ultimate margarita on the rock without salt... The Margaritas here are really good! After about three of the ultimate one I started to feel really good! Have to love the liquid courage! HAHA  Off the menu you I ordered the mini chimis the beef ones. The meet was very delicious and the sides were very nicely arranged.   My overall experience here was really good! Next time I return here I think Ill try the beergartita and the enchiladas.',4
'Why is a cheapskate like me shopping at AZ Tile?  Well the Tempe location has many secrets - secret deals that is.  OK so theyre not that secret but if youve been to the other locations youre just looking a gorgeous displays of lovely tile and solid surface slabs.  But at the Tempe location this is where the extra unwanted slightly mismatched or maybe slightly marred items go on sale.  Venture outside past the rows of gorgeous slabs on the inside and you hit the huge outside yard filled with sale slabs.    I bought a bunch of their Samsung Radiance Quartz on sale - because it wasnt up to Samsungs standards.  The errors were circled in pencil and they were tiny and easy to work around.  Thank you picky Samsung!  The marble and granite slabs are also a deal out in the yard.  You have to look around but youll be happy.  And then there are the secret tile deals!  I seriously have been coming to this place for years and had never been back past the Tile Sales desk (go through the pretty Tile sales room past the lovely bathrooms past the slab room and desk where you get your hard hats keep walking back through the doors and you hit the Tile Sales desks.  OK go past the Tile Sales desks and outside.  Wahlah!  Strange and wonderful short supply items in tile.  Ive never bought any of this tile - too strange mostly :).  But there are some serious deals out there if theres something you want.    Last time I was out there there were some huge pieces of granite that had been slabs that were cut into tiles for some special order.   Really wild stuff.  So yes it is true I buy most of my tile down the street at Floor and Decor.  But if you either want something special tilewise or you want some sale slabs Arizona Tile is the place.',5
'oh man its time for the fried food festivities at the fair again!   now on sundays its 2 bucks before 2pm to get in (it use to be free before 11am). and parking goes way up around 11am. we pulled into one of the side street lots and got parking for 5 bucks. as we were walking out they changed the sign to 10 bucks and then again to 15 bucks!  it was the same as last year...hot full of greasy food and more tattood/booty short wearin/large panus people than you can shake a stick at! which is why its so damn fun.   we notice 4peaks was doing a beer exhibition and show but that never materialized. we did buy the 35 dollar all you can ride wrist bands and made it onto about 5 rides but then we got tired of standing in lines for over 30 minutes so we spent the rest of the time wandering around and eating horribly.   on that note the deep fried watermelon was actually pretty darn good (it should be a 8.50). the deep fried nutella was gooey goodness as expected. i wasnt impressed with the deep fried reese cup. what blew us a way was the deep fried lasagna. we read that it was super good and they were correct.   the dough was thin just on the outside layer of pasta and it was super crispy and salty. the lasagna itself was very tasty...thick marinara with plenty of spinach and mushrooms and cheese. our favorite food at the fair in many years.   go early on the weekends and buy a 1 dollar water outside the gate but dont open it (you are allowed unopened beverages) because once inside that same water will cost 3 bucks.   otherwise....enjoy the atrocity that is the AZ state fair!',5
'Love it.  Lines are long during dinner hours but its worth it.  each plate is anywhere between 1$ to 3$.  there are a lot of varieties and you can even order directly.   if you dont like the sushi there are other food options availables.',4
'Enjoy coming here with a group cooking our own grub and playing in the sand. Evenings in April and May are great as are September and October. Winters are a bit chilly after sunset and the summer... well I dont need to explain that one.   No great deals on food or drinks. Service is hit or miss but I come for the company and dont really mind. Order a few pitchers and your grub to cook then pretend youre at home having a BBQ. No service required!',3
'As one of my anniversary gifts to my husband I made him an appointment for a  massage and the signature Oxygen facial for me. Once checked-in the ladies escort you back to the changing room where your given an oversized fluffy soft robe and slippers. The lounge area has cucumber slices for your eyes cheese for your hunger and water or tea for your thirst. Try out the steam shower to get clean for the treatments. The oxygen facial was just what I needed after a long flight. It perked up my previously dry lifeless skin but left me feeling refreshed and relaxed. My husband enjoyed his massage stating it was done with the correct amount of pressure.',4
'The first time I went about 4 years ago we sat in the dining room . Service was adequate the food was good enough and it was just an average experience. As we walked out we noticed that the bar was the place to be! Since then we have been for happy hour at least 20 times.   We make reservations and a booth is always waiting for us! Live Jazz and the people watching is always a plus. Skip the bread its not worth it. I think weve tried pretty much every appetizer on the menu. Hands down favorite are the Shrimp and Shitake fritters. The Kung Pao calamari is unique the addition of peanuts and crunchy veggies. The sauce is divine and we always order extra for the fritters! The Ahi in soba broth (not the tartare) is light and fresh.  Dont waste the cals or tummy space on the Tempura scallops. The Jumbo shrimp and crab salad is a treat and the portion is huge.  They also have amazing blue cheese dressing even though it is quite garlicky.  Also a miss were the lobster spring rolls they were too fried and crunchy with no trace of lobster!  We tend to stick with the happy hour offerings but we tried a special soft shell crab tempura once. It is one of the best things I have ever had!',5
'The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan',4
'Brooklyn style pizza (the only real pizza) at its absolute BEST. Half the spots in Brooklyn dont even match Patsy Grimaldis. Dont waste your money or risk your tastebuds on any imitations...  The margarita (fresh tomato mozzarella and basil) is my favorite and most purists will agree a good pizza rarely needs more. Also a great wine selection service and atmosphere. This location is my favorite however they are all great and consistently high in quality and service.',5
'I have been frequenting Pita Jungle for over 7 years since I have moved to the Valley.  They WERE one of my favorite eateries.  I have hosted keynote speakers and workshop facilitators  from the college for lunch and dinner at Pita Jungle where wed have upwards to 20 people at the restaurant and tip handsomely.  Today for some reason I along with a group of friends was ignored as we waited to be served.  We were seated and were not offered beverages until I began to wave my hands after sitting for 10 minutes.  The waters were brought to us by a reluctant host (no servers dared to approach the table...they all stared at one another) who told us that our server was busy but shed be right with us.  Another seven minutes passed and shed walked by our table six times and never looked in our direction.  We decided to leave the establishment and the overworked server that couldnt acknowledge a party of three (while servicing multiple tables AROUND ours.)    In short I will NOT be financially supporting Pita Jungle in the future. The lack of acknowledgement was so blatant that neighboring tables were looking at us and then looking at the server wondering what was going on...what a shame.',1
'We enjoyed our selves potstickers crab puffs S&P pork chops(killer) and  walnut shrimp BBQ pork Fried (OK)... We will be back!',4
'If I could do anything in life as well as Essence does croissants I would die a happy woman.  Perfection.',5
'Love this place for a casual dining experience. Great pulled pork and chicken.  Also many BBQ sauces to choose from and the best fries in the world. Service is typically very good although it can be server-dependent.',5
'On the very rare occasion we were in downtown Chandler for a friends birthday dinner.  After dinner we were full the weather was nice and we were craving dessert.  I had heard about Paletas Betty and always wanted to try it.  I decided on the arroz con leche which basically tasted like rice pudding.  It was good and creamy .  My brother had the platano (bananas foster with carmel and rum) - his was pretty good but it didnt have that creamy texture but more of a frozen bar that you had to bite down hard to break a piece off.  Though the concept is neat all with the mold that shows each bar has been taste tested with a bite mark on each corner it isnt something that I would really ever crave again.  It was nice to try to say I have now tried it but I definitely wouldnt go out of my way to have it.  Nonetheless its a local business so everyone else who lives in the area should frequent the place!!',3
'Was ok',3
'Ho brah...heard dis place was da kine went here wikiwiki at pau hana time....Finding ono grinds in Arizona is tough yeah. Evens do Arizona has choke local people. Whadda gives you say brah? Do local people stop liking Hawaiian food when dey come to da mainland? Ho dont look at me brah Ill nevah forget my first time grinding at Rainbows washing down my plate lunch with a slush float...but anywayz....  Aloha Kitchen aint Rainbows brah. It hints at da Islands with a linoleum floor and basic tables and chairs. (Dis assumes brah you come on a day other than Mondays when da Kitchen is pau.) But as you walk around dont expect to see like shave ice or spam musubi or some guy with a wet okole.  Still its casual and relaxed and usually not loud n crazy.  Not that I know fo sure brah. I always get da kalbi to go and dont stick around der long. So you says to youzeself brah dis fella order one thing on da menu and hes gonna tell me how dis place broke da mouth? Brah fo reals. Da proof is in da mac salad scoops of rice youze name it. Go to a chain like L&L or Ono....you see what I mean bumbye.   Aloha Kitchen is strictly a counter place. Da grinds may come with a touch of ohana...but dont expect anyone to serve you. You order you pay an den you grind brah An wen you done you talk story until youre pau. Still da girl at da counter is choke friendly and never rude.  Whuzzat youze say? Doesnt everything in Hawaii cost more? Especially grinds? Fo sure brah...a trip to a supermarket in Hawaii can give you chicken skin. Good news is brah da Kitchen wont do that. As of yet nothing is over $10...but den again is it gonna stay dat wayz fo evahs? No ways brah no ways.   S if it is take out you crave and you dont feel like Subwayz or Mickey Ds den take youze opu to Aloha Kitchen Youll be hundred of miles away from da beach or waterfalls or an ABC Store...But...youll be full...an not just of aloha brah.',4
'I come here to see Kim. Shes GREAT! She makes me feel very comfortable. Shes probably the only reason why I go here though. Yes everything is up to date clean and appealing but the front desk girls usually have an attitude and arent very welcoming. Also I usually wait an hour past my appointment to see my gyno. The nurse will call me back on time takes my weight and blood pressure then has me undress in the room. So I sit there naked and cold on the table for the remainder of the time. Like I said my doctor is the only reason why I keep coming back. Shes absolutely great.',3
'Like everyone else it seems the Cornish Pasty Company came as a suggestion from a friend I have been meaning to try it out for a while.  First of all the decor was awesome. The church pews industrial purse hooks tile candle wax candles and large photos of English industrial workers really set the mood. The servers were relaxed helpful and friendly. The music wasnt what you normally hear in a restaurant but I LIKED that about it.   The drink selection is very good I think lots of neat import beers and theyll do a taster sample if you want one. I love ciders so I ordered the Strongbow it was a bit on the warm side but nothing to be too upset about.  Im not a foodie by any means Im rather bland when it comes to trying new things so I stuck with a safe menu item Chicken Pot Pie. It was pretty good although I was hoping for more of a cream based sauce but thats a personal preference thing I think.   We also ordered the Carmel Apple dessert pastry. That was yummy! But it was odd that they served it with chocolate chip icecream instead of vanilla as mentioned on the menu perhaps they were out?   Anyhow I would recommend the Cornish Pasty Company to anyone looking for something new a little different and perhaps an tasty adventure of sorts.',4
'Deliciously decadent little bites of chocolate paradise!',5
'DONT GO HERE! I got stomach upset after I ate their carne asada burrito. The standard is not as Filbertoes or Rivas.  STAY AWAY',1
'So we went here for lunch and was happpy. I did not even expect to eat here but we saw it on the way to another place and decided to try it out. The inside is a cozy new Mexico western kinda feel to it. We had the pork dish we had is unreal. Smoked pork rice and beans and a couple tortillas. This dish made this a 4 star review rather than a 3 star. The girlfriend and I decided to split that and a sandwich. We tried the turkey sandwich and it was just OK came with fries. On the turkey sandwich it came with pablano peppers which sounded good but it was one really big pepper and it was to thick for the sandwich. Mabey if they cut it into smaller pieces we would have liked it better. The waitstaff and host were very friendly and the prices are good. Lunch specials for as cheap as $10 and somethings ranging in the $20 area. I want to come here for happy hour and that pork dish. This place is worth a try for sure!',4
'Cheap fast decent atmosphere and great flavor. You cant go wrong at Tosinos. We stepped in on a weekday for lunch and it wasnt crowded at all. The wall menu is digital with pictures of their various items scrolling through the screens.  I ordered a carne asada burrito ($4.75). At less than $5 this was a great deal. The burrito was made in just a few minutes huge and filled to the brim with lots of carne asada meat guacamole onion and tomato. The salsa bar on the side had 2 different red sauces a green sauce and lime wedges which were great condiments to compliment the burrito. The nicely grilled tortilla held all the ingredients in well.  The restaurant has a lot of booths for people to sit at and compared to other places that serve similar quickie Mexican food (Los Favoritos Filibertos) the atmosphere here is a step up from them!  Definitely a new favorite for Mexican food in this area!',5
'We have dined here and picked up to go orders several times and it has always been a good experience.  That being said we only always order the gyros with side salad and my son gets the chicken fingers with french fries (fries are very tasty). We have not tried anything else outside of our comfort zone.  We pretty much come here when we are in the mood for gyros and it is close to our home. The food is always delivered quickly and with excellent service.   Not crazy about the ambiance in the restaurant.  Not sure what it is exactly but it doesnt leave me with warm fuzzy feelings.',4
'This is a great trail to hike for all ages. Its not too challenging but the scenery makes up for it. Its never too packed every time Ive been. The parking is plentiful and the area is easy to get to. Theres bathrooms and hiking guide at the beginning of the trail. Theres places on the trail where you can rock climb as well. We completed the whole thing in about an hour and half. We never felt too winded.. its a good trail to hike as a pre-workout before heading to gym.',4
'So I finally checked it out over the weekend great customer service. One of the associates took the time to tell me all about yoga and the classes that they have. Leaned something new Not only are there yoga classes on Sundays in the park but there are also other classes available Monday and Tuesday ( not Yoga ) I think it is amazing for them to do such a courtesy!    Ive only tried yoga once in my life time it was some kind of sweat box yoga which I felt like I was dying!  Im excited to check out yoga in the park!',5
'The food here is really really good.   The restaurant overall has a lot of different places to sit.  My only complaint is that they were out of half of the liquors/liqueres used in their specialty drinks.',3
'Im really surprised at how Churchs has turned themselves around.  In the eighties it was a hot new property that was opening stores all over the place. I guess over-expansion hit; and didnt they go bankrupt?   Anyway we came to this location recently and really enjoyed the food.   They have a sign inside that states they were judged better then Popeyes.  Now I find it unusually that a franchise would mention a competitor when you have already made the decision to go there and eat.    Made me wonder where the nearest Popeyes is located???  But the food was really very good.  And maybe just maybe as good as Popeyes.',3
'I eat here very often I enjoy the atmosphere they always have several sporting events on to choose from and the food the food at this sports bar it is awesome!  I have not had anything there I do not like my favorite (although I do not alow myself to order it to often) is the Monte Cristo sandwich.  It is amazing I am also very suprised at how many people I take there that have never had a Monte Cristo if you have not had one pony up and go get one it sounds weird maybe even gross.... but just do it.... you can trust me... I am a faceless voice speaking to you from the all knowing internet.... The onion rings there are also really good they have a very nice spicy heat to them (I recommend a side of ranch dressing).    Their happy hour menue is very good many affordable things to order that are very tasty.  Also as a past bar tender myself I have been very pleased with the martinis and mixed drinks that they serve (and no one is more critical than a bar tender) I am slightly embarrassed to admit that their frozen margaritas (I know I know I did drink a frozen margarita) are really really good.  The only gripe I have had with them is that the last couple of times I have tried to order a beer that they have been out of what I want.  This is not a Sports Grill you go to for crappy food and good beer Id say its a Sports Grill you go to for good food and crappy beer!  Enjoy!',4
'Thanks for the reco Joel you rock!! Would also like to thank the the owners of Tortas El Guerro for opening a location closer to me than 16th street!! Woohoo!!  I have a long standing relationship with Tortas El Guerro. They make some of the best tortas in town at some of the best prices. You know youve hit the gold mine when youre the only white boy in the place!! Starting out at 16th Street then branching out Ive managed to visit all their locations. So when I saw that Joel posted this I nearly wet myself!    Ordered the Cubana ($6.50) which had ham cheese pork leg and beef milanesa! This was a hefty man size sandwich thats a pretty tall order to shove into your mouth. Fortunately I have an unhinging jaw (well not really but sounds kind of cool like a snake or something) so I was able to eat it sort of neatly I actually pressed it down a little lol. The flavors were fresh and well seasoned. A topping of their avocado salsa really hit the spot but be warned it truly is spicy. In fact I wasnt  expecting it actually brought a tear to my eye very nice!  Also order a Alebre Quesadilla ($5.99) which was stuffed full of steak onions peppers bacon and cheese. Each stringy cheesy melty bite was sheer gluttony after having the Cubana. Next time Ill only order one or the other. Egads!  I really liked the space. While it was clearly the shell of a Wendys I liked that they added some rustic plank flooring and tight subtle lighting. Very comfortable friendly and super clean!    Looking forward to visiting again soon love this place!  P.S. they have a drive thru!',4
'Yum. After doing some shopping at the Mekong plaza we decided on having lunch here. Very clean which is a big plus for a Vietnamese establishment. The food was great very tasty. Would love to back.',5
'When I average out all the aspects of Gallo Blanco I reach a four star rating.  The food and happy hour are the two reason we keep coming back.  The service is not a reason to return but we put up with it to eat those yummy little tacos.  This place is just off the lobby of the Clarendon Hotel which is hipster central. Everyone who works at Gallo Blanco falls into that hipster category which in my humble opinion is the reason the service falters.  No one wears a nametag or any identifiable mark of actually working there so its hard to flag someone down if you need something.  A few servers act like you are inconveniencing them for being there.  We put up with all that because the happy hour prices are great and the pork tacos and carne asada burrito are to die for!  We also love the green and red salsa (you can find the same stuff at Crescent Ballroom).',4
'I have been back again and again they are still awesome.  Every time I go or call in an order I vow Im going to try something different and every time I order the same thing.  One day Ill try something other than the Pei Wei Spicy Chicken.    Their take out is very well run they know who I am when I call and they even know what I want its always ready when they say it will be and its always hot when I get it home.  That said eating in is always best not sure why but the food just tastes better on a plate than it does from the plastic container.',4
'Stayed here one night over a weekend so the kids could visit Castles n Coasters.  I thought this place was great!   Pros - $55 a night with AAA dicsount!           - Patio room direct access to the pool           - Clean room           - Comfy beds linens and pillows           - Great restaruant and entertainment options very close by           - Blackout drapes were AWESOME - kids slept til almost 10!  Cons - AC never really did cool the room not hot but not cool like I like it           - Hotel was empty free breakfast buffet turned out not to be.  They             did make us eggs but the kids were disappointed not to have all              they can eat',4
'Cant say enough good things about Mark!  He has nothing but clients interest in mind. We started working with Mark just a couple weeks before needing to find a place and he found us the perfect place in just a week! He is very knowledgable and maintains great communication! He always kept us informed on new potential places and kept our interest in mind.  I would recommend him to anyone and will definitely use him I the future!',5
'As my first experience at Wildfish I was completely blown away by the high-standards of service and amazing menu. We came with a party of 6 at 7:30 and were quickly sat in their spacious dining room within seconds... Everyone in our group was more than satisfied with the chicken scallops fish and sides we shared. You can expect to pay a decent price for this type of meal but it still is on my mind a day after. Definitely worth a shot.',5
'Love this place! Chic cute with some Asian deco elements and the most important the shaved ice is so yummy!!!  3 of us came after a Saturday brunch ordered a large size of Taro and Original shaved ice paired with sweet red beans and mango fruit (they also offer mango jelly) and topped with caramel drizzle. Maybe because of our choice this plate was very very sweet. If you dont like sweet that much choose something different. The large size was definitely enough for 3 of us! The shaved ice was very fine fluffy and felt like cotton candy! And as it melts it seems to be more like ice cream than ice. The texture is very different from the other shaved ice I have tried where you can feel more of the ice.   If Snoh was not 20 miles away from me i would visit at least once a week! Cant wait for the next visit :)',4
'It took me about 18 months of living in Arizona to stumble on this and it was by pure accident.  This place is DELICIOUS!  Think of a chipotle/subway-esque place but for Italian food.  You can choose between an Italian-style burrito (the Pellini) pasta bowl or salad.  I got the pasta bowl and not only was it amazingly good there was enough for two meals so I got to enjoy it all over again the next day.  Everything was fresh and tasty and I cant say anything bad about this place.  So many different options for an extremely reasonable price.  You decide between the three styles and then choose your meats sauce and extras.  Once my b/f and I move to Scottsdale well be making many more trips here and I raved about it to several of my friends to try out :)  They had already beaten me to the punch and I was upset they hadnt told me about this place earlier!!',5
'I love the food and great wine selection of this place and the fact that its close to my home.  Ive had some issues with the service at times but I will say that it was quite busy when the service wasnt up to par.  Despite that its worth returning to and supporting the local businesses!',3
'Zipps!   One of the Valleys best happy hour if youre looking for a laid-back atmosphere I really enjoy the layout of this location.  A 32-ouncer and Golden Medium wings are a must! But dont underestimate the strong margaritas. Yummy Burgers and AMAZING foccacias.   A great sports bar to watch the bigger games. NFL NBA MLB and college. Although my boyfriend and I feel that there are too many U of A fans. (GO DEVILS!)',5
'Went there for lunch today with my wife since we saw a good review in the paper.  We were kind of disappointed.  I had the menudo--while a big bowl it was not very flavorful.  And we also ordered three of the standard (small) tacos - fish canitas and carne asada.  Fish was very skimpy and not good.  The carnitas and carne asada tacos were also poor -- meat chopped into itsy-bitsy pieces and overcooked.  It was like eating bits of dried and flavorless cardboard.  We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food.',2
'I threw my friends bachelorette party here this Sat and had an amazing time! Though this place is very fancy and classy they are super laid back with the partying and drinking. Makes for a perfect mix! We went all out and got a table with bottle service and two rooms to stay in. They gave us a bottle of champagne for free and brought it up to the room for us to toast which was cool. We had 18 girls in two rooms and we didnt get one complaint! We stayed at shade the club upstairs by the pool until 2am and then changed into our swimsuits to go for a dip in the pool. I love how the pool never closes so you can drink all night long! Shade also plays great music which we loved. Good mix of different stuff so everyone was happy.  I did have a little bit of issues with the woman who booked our table. Her name was Haley. She was not very responsive and didnt return my calls emails or texts. I wanted to decorate our table but wasnt sure what was allowed and she never answered my questions. But the night of the party I mentioned this to the manager and she brought us a free bottle of champagne and sincerely apologized for the trouble. This was enough of a redemption for us. It couldnt have went better! Thank you W for an awesome and memorable night!!',5
'this was my first time to try this place. im from the bay area california & i come to arizona whenever my dad has to come to work here.   my dads coworkers took us to this place for lunch earlier today. i thought it was gonna be super good. especially hearing from them that they absolutely love this place.  the service was really great. our food came out really quick. i felt a little cramped eating tho. the booth we were sitting in was really tight. i thought the table was way tooooo close to me.  we ordered the pineapple fried rice. it was really good but i feel like it could of been better. we also had pad thai. didnt like it too much. it had no kind of flavor to it. ive had way better back at home. but this restaurant is really nice. very modern decor. nice area. i gave it 3 stars.. pad thai needs more flavor to it and seats need to be more spacey.',3
'How can a single store consistently put out such horrible items. Now I will say that I do go late and usually only because everything else is closed but is that an excuse? You are open you are open. Its has been several months since I last was traumatized with old stale EVERYTHING but last night after a 5 hour trip up to Flagstaff and back I was desperate at the thought of having to make something at home. It was last night 12:45 (close at 1:00) I ordered 2 Jr Chz Dlx (extra pickles and onions) and a small chili with onions. Well I got a cheeseburger with guess what? Pickles and onions- nothing else and oh yeah a 2/3 full cup of room temperature chili. OMG why dont I learn????? I have had AWESOME Wendys before- It can be done. Maybe if I went at lunch I would have better luck but but under no circumstances am I risking a lunch meal there. I am a night nurse so many times I go to these places because of my busy schedule so this is my excuse- What is yours Wendys? PS....... Never again',1
'Thought they had closed down. Not so! Just a new sign. Also closed on tuesdays.  Excellent Sonoran-style hot dog: bacon wrapped with beans tomato mayo mustard etc. As good as the best Ive had in Tucson (el Nene Ruiz) and better than Morenos down the street (they are not bacon wrapped as a Sonoran dog should be; Mickeys are).',5
'This restaurant was amazing. The service was pretty good. A little forced with their manners and courtesy but they tried and were attentive. Very young and maybe even a little inexperienced staff. However; the food made up for anything that could be construde as a negative! The atmosphere was also nice. A little too bright inside I thought. We ordered based on the waiters recommendation the lobster tempura which was $68 but so delicious!! Presentation was incredible on everything. The tempura asparagus was a great compliment to our beef entrees. My friend ordered the Japanese Wagyu meat which is highly exclusive and was priced at $10 and oz. So amazing though we both had some and thought it was worth it! They served it with two salt dishes a black lava salt and white truffle and they accented the flavor perfectly. I ordered the filet that came with a chili ginger sauce. Also delicious! The meal was amazing presentation and serveware was beautiful. Their wine list really surprised us. We did have to correct the bill at the end as they charged us $130 for a bottle of Roar which was featured on the menu for $90. This would be a place you could take your girlfriend for her birthday or someone you want to really impress. Best Japanese food Ive ever had hands down!',5
'I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.',1
'My son and I just visited this location yesterday for dinner. We sat in the bar area and had great service. I had a special drink request and the bartender had no problems with it. We asked to share an entree and it came that way to the table. When my son wasnt ready to eat it when it came they offered to put it back under the lamps to keep it warm. When my son finally returned (from playing games) the waiter said that the manager didnt like the appearance of his entree so they prepared him a brand new one. Now thats service. We had a chicken w/shrimp dish. We got a $20 power play card and entree for $25.  My only disappointment was that they got rid of the Deal or No Deal game!',4
'I hate pho. I do. I hate almost all Asian food save Malaysian Thai and Indian. And those can be pretty interchangeable considering the former is often a hodgepodge of the latter. I find pho boring and only eat it when Im sick. You know this. You read Jetta Rs review already.  So whats with the 5 stars right?  Im a skeptic to the extreme. We ordered Thai iced tea and I was very very dissapointed (and a wee bit smug) that theirs comes right out of the can. That was all it took for me to cross my arms and begin the nay-saying. Were waiting for her General Tsao Chicken and my Orange Chicken lunch special. Poor Jettas puppy-dog-facing me over the table trying to placate my snide and pessimistic predictions about the food wed yet to be served.   Watch. Its going just to be plain chicken breasts with orange slices on top.  And then it came and I shut my mouth. It was so...pretty. Fried rice shaped into a perfect little mound. Crispy chicken glistening in sweet-but-not-too-sweet-even-if-youre-super-picky-like-me sauce. And the taste. OMG. Im a believer in Chinese food again. Chinese food from a Vietnamese restaurant. And sprinkled throughout - why yes tiny little mandarin orange slices cut into quarters.   What the hell Pholicious? Are you trying to kill me with perfection? Ive got a reputation to keep.   Maybe it was a fluke. Maybe I could still hate this place. Jetta and I returned today me with chopsticks in hand and ready for a show down. Its on now bitches. Kung Pao Chicken. Bring it.   And they did while smiling and telling my bestie she looked pretty today. Damn theyre sneaky!  And the chicken?     ...perfect. Again. Jettas pho? Also perfect. And I HATE pho.  You win this time Pholicious. I admit defeat. Take your 5 stars while I sulk off into the sunset.   Can we rematch tomorrow?',5
'I have been a Penzeys Spice fan for years and I usually order from their catalog being that I am in Flagstaff.  But their Phoenix store is a must stop whenever I am in the Valley.  They have virtually everything that the catalog offers.  Its a wonderful store with fantastic staff.  There are so many Penzey Spice favorites of mine that its difficult to narrow down any specifics.    The Brady Street Cheese Sprinkle is a must have for any kitchen/table..it goes on virtually everything (pizza mashed potatoes salads) I also highly recommend their Herbs de Provence as it is a staple mix of flavorful and savory herbs for a myriad of dishes.  Their curries are ALL fantastic!  Finally I very much so recommend Penzeys vanilla beans as they trump Williams-Sonomas in size and value.    Penzeys prices are very surprising; incredibly economical for the extremely high quality of their products.  Hit this store and stock up on some good spices and taste the difference in the food your prepare.  Quality of spice truly makes the heart of every dish.    Happy eats!',5
'While having lunch at Rehab we asked the locals where to go on a Sunday night. Pickle said Hi Fi is the place to be. For a Sunday night this place was packed! (It didnt seem like there were any other places nearby that were open beside some sports bar). We arrived around 10pm and there were already plenty revelers. No cover woohhoo. Im from southern California and it reminded me of Hermosa Beach...Sharkeez Hermosa or American Junkie aka douchebag heaven (made me LOL to read the other reviewers). The DJ played an eclectic music selection for all dancing types. The layout is well designed with indoor booths outdoor seating and flat screens an impressive pin-up mural above the bar and decent sized dancefloor. The right wall with subwoofers was pretty sweet. I know where to party if I visit Scottsdale again.',4
'We went to the McDowell Mountain Music festival last night and stopped in to The Compound Grill for dinner.  We started out with a couple of beers--belgian wit.  Mothership I think.  We also had a couple of appetizers.  Green Bites (edamame and green bean combo) and The Nachos.  The edamame were for kiddo.  I wish it wouldve come with a dish to discard the empties.  The nachos were for us and they were fabulous.  Generous portion good balance of topping vs. chips.  Just really tasty all around.   At this point I was pretty full.  I ordered Chicken Popsicles for the kiddo and hubby ordered fish and chips.  The chicken dish was 2 skewers of panko crusted strips with fries.  Kiddo ate it all and shared me his fries so I was happy about that.  Hubby shared me a piece of his fish.  It was just alright as fish and chips go.  Total bill for 3 beers 2 apps 1 kid entree and 1 adult entree: $57.  Not bad.  Not bad at all.  The best part is that there is a music venue within reasonable driving distance.  Yay for music!  A local band started a set while we were finishing dinner and my son cried because he didnt want to stop listening to the music (we were taking him to the outside stage to see more music--he just didnt really get that part in the moment).  Im so happy that there is a family-friendly place in N. Scottsdale to enjoy music.  So happy.',4
'If youre here for happy hour and are sitting at the bar this place is awesome and the prices are great.  Come here for breakfast and you will see both a menu and a breakfast buffet that manage to be overpriced and limited in variety at the same time.  I wouldve gone elsewhere but Ive no rental car and the other restaurants at the hotel are closed.',2
'We dont live in Arizona so having our relatives take us here was aaawesome!  The place was great.  So great that we went back like two more times during our stay in Arizona.  LoL  One of the first things we did was google to see if there were locations in San Diego...we found one in El Cajon.  We have not been to that one yet but it is in the plans at some point.  The food was fresh portions were great and was not overly pricey by any means.  Reminded us of a Panera....which come to find out it is a sister company of sorts.  Great food here.',5
'Long ago and not really that far away this place used to be awesome.  Good live music now and then.  Lots of different peeps for people watching.  Service was fairly fast.  Oh how things have changed.    Apparently theyve gone over to the dark side. The last few times Ive encountered lots of folks there looking to meet folks for the first time (Can you say internet hook up?) and a lot of teenagers who like Jake was back in the day are escaping from their parents supervision. And the service has generally acted like they could care less.  The stuff Ive always gotten is hard to screw up so its hard to speak much for quality - but you can tell its not exactly served with love.    Still - its an awesome location to meet up.  There are lots of good tables inside - though it can get a bit noisy.  And since they dont rush you out of there too much its a great place to wait for your sugar daddy to show up and take you shopping.  Or before you go check out the latest sale at Pottery Barn.  Whatever.',3
'Great food! Great service and awesome experience!  Thanks Waffle House I love you :D',5
'This place rocks. Service and food are both great. Would definitely recommend you stop in and try it out',5
'Ssshhhh! Dont tell anyone....China King is NOT a buffet. This place it as authentic as it gets! The food is amazing the staff is great and they are always good for recommending something new and different. But like I said...Dont tell anyone about this little gem. We dont want to ever have to wait for a table!',5
'Best Bean and Cheese and Large Strips in the world. Been coming here for since 93 and have never eaten anything that wasnt good! PERIOD.',5
'I stayed here while I was searching for a house and I was kicked out because my payment was late one afternoon. I stayed here for about 1 month and I paid rent everyday on time. The manager also knew that my room was full of my personal belongings so to be kicked out with no transportation setup to move me would be virtually impossible. As a result of that Half of my belongings were stolen. I would never ever recommend this place to anyone. Do not bring a lot of things with you and do not stay too long. And it is best to have a vehicle when you do stay. They also raised the rate without notification.',1
'Ive only had a baguette once but never again it almost made my gums bleed!  However ever since they opened Ive been a fan of their most delectable croissant sandwiches. Great prices and awesome drinks. Suckks they dont take card but still worth it.',4
'.:chomp:. this is one .:mmmghgh:. good burger .:sllluuuurrrpp:. Its got a great combination of yumminess with a side of .:chomp:. awesomeness. The burgers are great and .:chomp:. perfect.   The custard is great .:lick:. and diabetic friendly .:mmmmmmm:.(They have no sugar added custard). i would definitely recommend this place! .:lick:.',5
'3.5 stars  I would like to give them more stars but they have some work to do.  Foodwise its some of the best Thai food Ive had in the area. Lots of options very flavorful well priced.   Service-wise its lacking. There is a particular waitress working there who is always very confused. I assure when you go you will know who Im talking about. No real harm done just lots of delay and mixed up orders. But my real issue with the place is that it smells...Not like food smells but border lining sewage smell. I almost walked out of there as soon as I walked in last time I was here  but I was starving so I decided to stay lol. I pray that its not coming from the kitchen but my wrenching gut tells me its from the bathroom. The bathroom is pretty gross and unkempt for a rather nice restaurant. Both the bathroom and decor could use a little work... it would take this place from a 3 to a 4 star for sure!  Anyway onto the food.   *Spicy Thai Fried rice- your standard fried rice not very spicy though for my Indian tongue so you have to specify if you want spicier  *Silver noodles- so yummy they use vermicelli-like glass noodles al dente mixed with veggies and your choice of meat. recommended.   * Pad thai- Also very yummy their version comes with shrimp tofu and chicken and the noodles are thinner than other pad thai Ive had  * Red curry- Very tasty coconut red curry sweet and spicy but different from Panang (too sweet in my opinion). Their version comes with bamboo shoots and green beans and I like to add eggplant it really soaks up the curry  * #26- I totally forgot what this dish was called but it was number 26 under Entrees. The waitress recommended it as it is a popular item to order and Im glad she did. It was carrots sauteed with meat and onions in a brown sauce that reminds me a little of black bean sauce at chinese restaurants. I think everyone would like this dish!  *Thai tea- meh Ive had better. I suspect they get theirs from a bottle.   I want to go back and try some other items especially the Tom Yum.  With a little work this place could be even better!',3
'I have to agree(for the most part) with the previous post.  The event this year was terrible.  In regard to the parking it was downright dangerous.  Due to the sheer number of people we were forced to park almost a mile away from the venue.  although apparently there were courtesy shuttles there was no signage to indicate where to be picked up and we subsequently choose to walk. This decision proved to be a bit of a risk to our personal safety since it was dark with no street lights or alternative lighting.  We HAD to trek down Carefree Highway which STILL had all four lanes open to vehicular traffic.  Ok organizers I can almost understand the need to suspend the balloon glow due to high winds(well discuss that more in a minute) but to actually put the safety of not only your patrons but the unsuspecting motorists at risk seems irresponsible of you.  If you dont have proper infrastructure in place perhaps you shouldnt hold the event regardless of how much money you potentially stand to profit!.    Parking/general safety issues aside I thought it was rude not to have any type of roadway announcements to tell potential customers that the main reason for the event was cancelled.  We had to wait until we reached the ticket gate(after walking over a mile) to be told there would be no balloons.  I found this abhorrent.  If electronic roadway signs can be used to advise me of potholes ahead they darn well can advice folks that theres no reason to keep walking to a non-event.  Come on organizers put some thought into it. You had to suspect that it might have been a possibility that the balloons couldnt be lit up  or do you expect me to believe that youre really THAT incompetent?  I know Carefree/Cave Creek is trying to promote its community as a local event center but I think they need to decide whether they want to be the idyllic little cozy semi rural community they seem to be or become a burgeoning suburb.  This is the second time Ive tried to attend an event in  this area only to be disappointed with an unannounced  last minute cancellation.  SHAME ON YOU!',1
'Nice lounge good views and neat menus. The service had high points and low points. Upon walking in and wandering around looking for a place to sit down a waitress approached us and offered to help find our group a place to sit down and relax. Within 5 minutes she had a large seating area cleaned and ready for us. The low point was when I ordered a vodka martini on the rocks with a twist but got a regular martini in a martini glass with an olive.  I thought that was a bit odd for a high end lounge but maybe I should just learn to order more popular drinks in the future.    Full disclosure - I am rooting for these waterfront places to succeed. It has been a tough few years and I admire the business owners who keep putting these places out there hoping that one day their venture on Southbridge will make it for the long haul.',4
'I was in the neighborhood and craving some healthy food...thank goodness I spy Pita Jungle. We shared the Spanakopita and while its not a lot- it is under $4. My favorite was the feta cube that was served with it. YUM. Best feta... I want to buy it in bulk its so light and delicious. We then shared the chicken shawarma  which was perfect and the grilled vegetable side which was a little too peppery- but still very good. It was a very satisfying and filling meal and great for keeping up my energy for the rest of the day. Weee!!!',4
'Its decent.  The Prices for lunch specials is great.  For a decent meal at a small price I like this place.  The pizzas were just ok but the wings are much better.',3
'We have just eaten at Secreto.  I had been there exactly one year ago in December and the food was amazing and everyone in our party was looking forward to a great meal together.   The exact same people that ate last December were also there this evening and we were all extremely disappointed.   The salsa was very bland and tasted like it had come straight from a can.   Apparently Friday is fajita night.  I ordered the shrimp fajitas - talk about disappointment!   The shrimp did not come out sizzling and the onions and peppers were very over cooked. Not only that  the shrimp still had their tails on - could you have spent a few dollars more for the shrimp without tails?  As far as flavor there was none - only hot.    The tortillas were dry around the edges and stale.  The beans and rice were ok but cold.  All for the price of $17.95.   Our waitress very unknowledgable and unpersonable.  Perhaps that was due to her being so young or possibly new - who knows.   The new owners have taken this amazing intimate restaurant and turned it in to a disaster of a cantina .  With horrible food and service it wont be long before they are out of business!   I know that no one from our group will be back.',1
'LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!   Get me some lobster bisque and the Mardi Gras pasta and Im all yours!   Happy Hour here is pretty darn good because the prices become more affordable. I feel that you get what you pay for at Pappadeauxs in terms of food and service but anytime you can get that with a discount it definitely gets better!   I love all the desserts but the sweet potato pecan pie with a cup of coffee really makes the evening paired with a side of Jazz on the covered patio.',4
'The food is good. The wine is great. The service is meh. The ambiance is thumbs up for being in a shopping center.',4
'They very helpful and very friendly....went twice in one day ...both time employees were very friendly...best burrito I have eaten in a while!!!',5
'Been to the Gyro House many times and have not been disappointed.  Gyros are great and blows My Fat Greek out of the water.',5
'Really good service and steak as expected.  Nice atmosphere for Monday Night Football....oh yea baby!',4
'Been wanting to try this place since my brother saw it on TV. That said I believe it is EXTREMELY unfair to jack up your expectations just because a restaurant was on TV. Come on people!  There are so many  food shows on the air these days that soon it will be more common to NOT have been featured on Some Food Show than the other way around!  While I concur with many fellow reviewers that the place did not bowl me over and was a bit pricey I did have great service and good food overall.  The specifics:  SERVICE: Prompt friendly suggestive and accomodating.   FOOD: I always appreciate a place that lets me order fatty or soft bacon. I also liked that I could order 2 slices or 4 (4 of course! Bacon is Meat Candy after all). The Brioche French Toast with carmelized bananas and pecans was just okay. The bread was light and soft so as not to be so filling that I couldnt finish it but caremelized shouldnt mean sitting in carmel sauce. There should be some crispy pan-fried texture to it and there wasnt so I was disappointed. It tasted like a canned sauce. Not good enough especially being that this was one of their signature dishes.   Orange Juice and coffee were both fresh and I got lucky and wasnt charged for both so my bill was about $3 less than it shouldve been which means my breakfast wouldve been about $21 with tip for one person. Thats a bit high although it is Scottsdale so I let that go.  SETTING/DECOR: Clean diner-like setting with great mountain views.  OVERALL: Not bad. I would return if/when Im in the area. I look forward to trying some of the other items on the menu.',3
'The 4-star rating is because of the taste.  Price:  150% of what youd expect to pay  Service:  Excellent.  the service staff is friendly smiley and seem glad youre there.  Taste:  absolutely wonderful.  The sauce is sweeter than most.  Ive only gone to the location south of Tempe Marketplace and it seems kind of industrial.  I can EASILY overlook something like that for a lower price so Im ready for lower prices.',4
'I was driving along on Thomas today when I saw Lunch & Dinner 50 Items $5.25 All Day painted on a window so of course I slammed on the brakes!  The dirty sign outside said Eastern Buffet & I ran in through the front door.  Its a mid-sized place of about average style (¿) for this kind of place.  To make sure its tacky enough they have a little swap meet going at the edge of the dining room!  Speaking of tacky all the tabletops were sticky.  They must have tried to clean them with lacquer thinner (whoops!) but now onto the food:  There were about 35 trays of food out (I dont count the sauces croutons etc.).  The fried chicken was greasy but the fried rice wasnt.  The egg flower soup was terrific & the salad items were all fresh & carefully sliced & laid out in the trays just so as if theyre really eager to please.  It wasnt lost on me.  The rest of the hot dishes were all good (at least) & the staff was nice.  Ill be going back!  3/31/09 Update:  I have been there several times now.  Some things that you should know:  *  Havent encountered any tacky tables lately but tacky swapmeet is still     in place!  (You wouldnt want to miss that!)  *  They have beer...  not sure if theres a full bar up front.  *  They dont open until 12:00 on Saturday & Sunday.  *  The prices on Saturday & Sunday are a little higher but still very low     at under $6.  These are good days to go!',3
'Let me just start off saying that I was an original tenant at Mandarina. I moved into my unit in Feb 2002 (the unit had never been occupied) and moved out April 2009 upon buying a house.   I am very picky when it comes to my living quarters and Mandarina lived up to my expectations throughout the years. I have to say that while every complex/neighborhood is going to have its fair share of problems (crime aggravating neighbors etc) at Mandarina there was rarely an incident.   Three gripes throughout the years:  Parking Accommodations -  About 95% of the parking is covered. If your guest parks in a covered space theyre liable to get towed if the resident arrives home to find their spot is taken. If there are no spots your guests must find parking elsewhere. Most likely next door at the Draw-10 and walk over.   Trash Pickup - This was both a perk and a pain. The perk was not having to cart your trash all the way to the trash compactor. You instead just left outside of the breezeway every pickup morning. My gripe is at no fault of Mandarina but the residents who did not abide by the trash service times.   Light rail - No fault of Mandarina. Waiting to get out of the complex to head east on Washington was always a pain after the light rail was completed.   While I had no issues with the staff upon moving out the original staff made it a truly great place to live back in 2002-2004.  Overall Id recommend Mandarina to anyone looking for a new apartment complex.',4
'Chinese Pho!?  How about Vietnamese Fried Rice?  Well needless to say Maxim is a mixture of two cultures.  My two cultures it happens to be and what I am - half Vietnamese and half Chinese. So our waitress and some of the staffs are speaking in Cantonese and serving up some Pho. Eh! Im not one to judge.  I order me some Pho since I heard this place was one of the better Pho places in town.  I have to admit it was a lot different from most Pho places but thats about it.  I did enjoy it and now that I think about it Im glad I didnt order the big boy bowl.  I can only eat so much and so much I ate. The broth was nice and hot and had that bold brown color.  My noodles were obviously not soaked well since I had to untangle it before eating it.  I dont like to see or do that thus its a negative in my book. - Enjoy!',3
'There are a couple of things I forgot to mention--my bad since I was rushing my review.  Sorry!  The beef in my Pho was very hard to chew and they arent very generous with the fresh greens and other veggies that go in the Pho--no cilantro either. :( Three days later we went up the street to my favorite place to make a comparison---Da Vang is a solid 3 stars but  no where close to 4 or higher.',3
'Well I wanted to try a sandwich here but ended up getting here just after the deli closed. I was going to buy a drink and pick up a to-go menu but that didnt work out either. Turns out this place RIPS YOU OFF for using your debit or credit card. Its a 50 cent charge for using plastic. I will not be coming back to this place ever because of this. Just a warning to everyone who wants to eat here or even buy gas or anything else. Be prepared to cough up an extra 50 cents if you use plastic.   Right across the street is an excellent sub place Rocket burger and subs so go there instead.',1
'We chose to go to Red Lobster because we wanted lobster. I guess we should be a bit pickier next time. I ordered rock and Maine lobster tails. While the maine lobster was delicious the rock lobster was tough and veiny. The service was excellent though.',3
'Yes five stars!  First review and I thought Id make it a good one.    From start to finish a fantastic experience.  The fish is *so* fresh and perfectly prepared.  My friend had a bone in filet - best steak weve ever had.  Just done to perfection.    The ambiance is nice - definitely upscale and vibrant.  And once it cools down a bit I cannot wait for the patio to get going.    Great job Wildfish I will definitely be back!',5
'My boyfriend and I go here all the time! We like the buffalo chicken strips haha. Its always crowded because its delicious! I definitely recommend going here :)',5
'I like eating here they have some good happy hour deals.  I think the atmosphere needs some sprucing up but they have already added some cool stuff like the sushi cams where you can watch the guys make rolls.  I would definitely eat here again',4
'If you want a cozy dive bar this is it.  Ask for the mystery shot and go for it!',4
'My recent trip to Chipotle was definitely disappointing. Ordered $60 worth of food and got $10 worth of service due to the idiots that are often staffed on Sundays.   We ordered take out and waited the ordained 40 minutes to leave the house for the ultra-slow Laveen location even tho the Chipotle near my house in Mesa takes 10 minutes. Upon arriving 10 minutes after the online promise time they hadnt even started the order.   My carnitas order was missing sour cream and guacamole which costs more. My daughter who has a severe gluten allergy received no apology when they forgot to switch out spoons and gloves. They just laughed and said Oops.  My tip to management: call Restaurant Undercover and see what is really going on cuz you just lost a weekly $60 sale from our family.',2
'Delectable!!!!!  Thats the one word that comes to mind. Fresh farm to table type food. Choice cuts of meat grilled to perfection. Reasonable wine prices and great selection. We went back two days later.',5
'Overall this park is a great place to get out and play. So far Ive only been with my daughter by ourselves but she seemed to have a ton of fun which means I had a ton of fun too!  There are a LOT of things you can do at this park. The place where we spent most of our time was the little jungle gym http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-ranch-park-and-tennis-center-scottsdale?select=xwlLZrgaOTH9o8b5AD9E_w#FLdEhKhwaTfS58T_LSfEUg.  Here my toddler was able to run and climb and expend a bit of energy. Theres a lot of natural shade in certain areas around this play area though its not completely covered. So during the summer months it might not be the perfect place to play as everything will undoubtedly be BLAZING hot.   As I sat on the bench while my daughter ran circles around the sand http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-ranch-park-and-tennis-center-scottsdale?select=xwlLZrgaOTH9o8b5AD9E_w#St7Po_6CpfQlbeRP5-Pj7g I noticed the myriad of things that this park offers. There are grills and covered pavilions for those times you want to have a nice family outing or a group barbecue. While we were there a Troupe of Boy Scouts was having an afternoon meeting. These covered pavilions provided a nice area for them http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/scottsdale-ranch-park-and-tennis-center-scottsdale?select=xwlLZrgaOTH9o8b5AD9E_w#4QOOTbV2EFjnqP2E7_GYGQ.  In my younger years I was an avid volleyball player. Adjacent to the picnic area there are several beach volleyball courts perfect during the Spring and early Autumn months. Im too new to AZ to try and play volleyball in this scorching Summer heat!  After my daughter grew tired of the sandbox and jungle gym areas we found our way over to the swing sets. There are only a few seats on the swings but they do offer seats for babies as well as for older children.  From here we could see several tennis courts a softball field and a GIANT open field perfect for just about anything. You could picnic under some of the shade trees like a family we saw. You could conduct team practices. You could play some flag football. I think you get the idea.  Although our trip to the park was fun with just the two of us I really feel like this place was geared more towards groups. Then again just about EVERYTHING is more fun when there are other people there with which you can share!',4
'First let me start off by saying that I used to have a love affair with Roka.  The Omakase was the multi-course sumptuous dining experience I selected every time I visited.  They had a $99 option and a $128 one and both were an exotic extravaganza of delectable delights (the $128 Omakase promised extra exotic pricier ingredients).  The Omakase is an improvisational dining experience with consideration given to the diners food preferences and allergies.  When I used to order the Omakase I always left dazzled by the presentation colors textures and flavors of the dishes I received.  Every dish was superb and left you anticipating your next experience.  Sadly the Omakase is now a shadow of its former self sorely lacking across every culinary dimension and I have twice walked away feeling disappointed and ripped off.  In the past year they have eliminated the $99 option but kept the $128 one.  No matter as long as the dishes maintain the same quality and consistency.  When I order the Omakase I expect to receive exciting and surprising dishes that highlight the chefs creativity and artistry.   What I dont expect to receive are generic dishes that can be ordered off the menu a la carte for a fraction of the hefty $128 price tag.  Here are the 6 courses I received at my last $128 experience (with accompanying a la carte prices): Shishito Peppers with Ponzu and Bonito - $7 a SINGLE scallop with curry sauce (since ONE scallop is not an a la carte menu item I am going to be be generous and use the pricing for the Robata Grilled Scallops with Yuzu Shiso) - $15 Assorted Steamed Shellfish with Tomato Miso - $23 Wagyu Beef Tataki - $18 Crispy Brussels Sprouts  - $7 and a lackluster presentation of dessert which consisted of one scoop of ice cream - $4 and Cassis Pear & Blood Orange Mousse - $12 ( the dessert was also accompanied by a razor thin slice of pear one slice of mango and two slices of kiwi).  Had each of items been ordered a la carte the sum total would have been $86 a $42 savings on the $128 Omakase price tag.    Again not only were the dishes not in keeping with the grand billing that Roka gives the Omakase: Roka Akors Tour De Force Featuring Our Signature Dishes and Inspired Creations (not really sure where the inspired creations part comes in since they are all a la carte dishes) the presentations have gone downhill too.  Desserts used to be magnificently presented on multi-platform dishes with tons of decorative fruits flowers and greenery.  Now they come on simple small white plates.  This Tour de Force is now nothing but a Tour de Flop and a colossal rip-off. As such I can no longer recommend this place nor will I be returning.  The love affair is definitely over.',2
'Note: This review is from a take-out perspective  Shanghai Club is a little Asian place in the middle of nowhere (the locals call it Anthem) but it is worth the drive.  Also I like the name because it makes me feel like Im part of the club Ive always wanted to fit in.  I have gotten take out twice now sampled a variety of dishes and have made up my mind.  I like the Shanghai Club.  The food preparation is very fast.  I call them place my order and then drive right over and pick it up.  All in all about 10-15min process.  The lunch specials are cheap and tasty.  The price ranges from $6.50 to $7.50 and you get a good amount of food and rice.  You can order from the lunch menu every day till 3pm.  The chicken is a lot like the NHL all white.  Unlike the NHL though its warm and doesnt bore me.  I would also promote the Sha Cha Beef if that is more of your thing.  They say its spicy but I personally tasted only a very mild kick.  Oh and their soups are huge.  The wonton soup was a meal in of itself.',4
'Woohoo As good as it gets is definitely what you get here. You get what you paid for and boy do you get what you paid for! This gym is very addicting and if you go here a lot you can justify the 65$ membership.  Gym Overall gets a 5/5 Rating in my opinion.  Customer Service can non consistent but 98% of the time its all nice and great people. Not enough to take off a star. When there is a problem it gets corrected.  Their trainers are excellent I highly recommend them. They charge 75$ an hour but they have specials many times like 3 sessions for $99.  Membership is $56-$65 activation fees are $20-$99.  Good nice new equipment nice pools slides and tv many good services and classes. LifeCafe offers amazing food although very very expensive. I recommend u just take protein shakes instead of eating here. LifeSpa is okay I would give them a B. They are on the more expensive side though...  if I do have an complaint its their HORRIFICLY slow website. Its very pretty but it is VERY slow sometimes please Lifetime Corporate do something to help your servers load pages more. Even employees at the Gym know its slow and they end up waiting for the corporate website to load. Its very frustrating. For customers who dont use their website you got nothing to worry about.',5
'The wait was a little long but the waitress was able to take or ordered while we waited as soon as we were seated our food arrived. I had the waffles with bacon.  The bacon was crisp and the waffles were like cake so delicious.',4
'After reading reviews I gave it a go. TASTEY!!! I will be eating everything off this menu. I had brisket sandwich - insanely good bbq sauce. The Mrs. ran the front and the Mr. ran the back. Phoenix needs more mom & pop joints. Highly recommended.',5
'Let us just start this with the name and the location. Mellow Mushroom on High Street. I do not think they could of planned it better. I feel like I am in Seattle or Oregon becauseit is just that type of feel. I would say that this is more for the younger higher crowd.  Old Guys like me who have never gone down that path can find the humor for sure.  So besides the great name and location nice music fun to be there. TVs are all around and loud.  I cannot say that I am excited by the food. The Pizza is just OK.  It took a long time to get it. But you never know until you try it right!  It is not bad it is just not great.',3
'Been here about five times since moving to the area food is okay but too expensive for what you get.lots of better Mexican restaurants around Phoenix.',2

'This place is the bomb. We were trolling around scottsdale on july 4th and popped in because of yelp reviews. Total find. Food wad great. Redsauce pasta superb mac and chee too good super salad and crazy good pizza. We will be back before heading back to socal.',5
'Awesome! I come here all the time for open gym volleyball and indoor soccer. Its a great facility with lots of room. Good snack bar. The equipment is also very good! I love coming here.',5
'Finally found our little foodie spot!!!  Love the atmosphere.  The food was great and the carmel chocolate desert in the jar was so good we ordered another.  The staff was friendly and knowledgable and service was great.  You can tell its managed well by how efficient the staff is at doing there job from hosting to bussing to serving it was all on point!',5
'Is this like the only place in midtown to get sushi? The portions seemed a bit on the lean side for the price but are otherwise good. Nothing Id had has been orgasmic but nothing Ive had has made me volcanically erupt. So a good little sushi shop for what its worth.  The service tends to be hit or miss and weve not had to wait for a seat.',3
'This place is super cool.  I found out about it on yelp as part of a quest to find an independent toy store.  Its tucked away in a strip center behind a Wendys in Chandler but totally worth the drive!  I spent way too much on Christmas for my nieces (1 and 7) because there were so many awesome things!  They even had toys I remember from 20 years ago that I had thought would not be around any more.  Really a wide variety of toys from science and educational to arts and crafts to infant stuff.  I am totally going back there whenever I need a gift.  They do free wrapping and have friendly helpful and knowledgeable staff!',5
'This is my nearest neighborhood Ace so I traipse in here fairly often for the odd doodad or thingamabob. The staff is always friendly and helpful and will help you find what you need. The four stars is for the personable local staff NOT for the faceless corporate troglodytes that comprise the vast Ace bureaucracy. Here is my cautionary tale about dealing with those boneheads...  I bought a shop-vac at this store because of a great deal ($10 rebate on a $40 item). I did have to remind the cashier that there was a rebate on the item so that she would furnish me the appropriate form. Luckily it appeared I could submit for my rebate on-line. Turns out my Ace Rewards on-line account could not be activated presumably because of some mysterious required gestation period. Ace customer service telephone operators were no help in getting my account set up they just explained that I was not in the system.  So I reluctantly pursued my rebate the old-fashioned way which involved filling out a form enclosing the UPC barcode from the box and sending a stamped envelope to the great Ace Rebate center in the sky  (actually it appears to be in El Paso). Now I get to please allow 8 weeks for processing. Great. An e-mail promptly assures me when Ace receives my claim. So then I wait. And finally eight weeks later I get a postcard telling me that my rebate request cannot be processed because it was missing a receipt!  Fortunately I am well-organized. I have scans of everything sent to Ace including the form which DID NOT specify the need for including a receipt. Simply the UPC code and the completed form was all that was requested! However the Gods of Ace (who apparently now reside in the Rebate Resubmission Department in Miami Florida) have smiled on me and allowed me to claim my rebate by sending in that darned receipt that they never requested. So off it goes with the cost of another stamp.  Turns out my Ace Rewards account is now activated. So any future rebates can be handled on-line. But I hate having to deal with that lame corporate bureaucracy for a measly $10. I also want some popcorn. My old neighborhood Ace in Sacramento offered free popcorn and coffee with your purchase. Yeah... that would make me feel better!',4
'I love ice cream yes I do I love ice cream how bout you?   This is delicious cheap frozen yogurt. It is right by my work and we send someone over every Tuesday for frozen yogurt day. I occasionally get it when my yummy boyfriend surprises me with a treat.   BUT.......   You do all the work yourself. Which is great because you are very quick and efficient and in a hurry to enjoy your melting treat.   WHY tell me WHY is there a tip jar for the pimply faced crabby teenagers who work behind the counter and move like sloths? Why would I be encouraged to tip anyone other than myself for all the hard work I did?',3
'Went at lunch today with a coworker. This was our first time and wasnt sure what to expect. If you know this area you know that this building has been many different restaurants and none of them around very long. We we please to find a very friendly staff and cozy island themed restaurant.  I went for the first dog on the menu - the Island Dog. This was a freshly grilled beef bratwurst with chipotle garlic mayo Maui mustard coconut pineapple and a ton of fresh crispy chopped bacon. I also got a side of the Maui cole slaw.   I dug right into the dog and was rewarded with a mouthful of amazing flavors. What surprised me the most is how it all worked so well together. I wouldnt have ever imagined putting coconut on something with chipotle garlic mayo! But man does it all work. The brat was freshly grilled and everything tasted fresh. Even the buns seemed special. I also enjoyed the slaw which was a sweeter mayo based slaw.   My coworker had the Lava Dog - Shaggy Style. This was a monster of a meal in itself. It has an all beef hot dog chili (lava) jack cheese and the Maui cole slaw. He had a side of fries with it. He devoured that dog using a fork because it was too much for him to take in. It looked amazingly good and we both agreed well be back for more - soon.   The prices were reasonable the staff was super friendly and the food was delicious. Lets hope that Maui Dog is here for a long time!',5
'I grew up on thai food. Always have a hard time finding a good place. I love their food here. I live way out in Surprise and when Im in the mood to thai food I make the trip out to Sala thai. The staff is very friendly and the service is pretty quick too.',4
'Nom nom nom.  Great lattes. I like the vibe of the phx location--very chill.',5
'Im not a coffee snob but I love a good Americano.    This place has the charm youd expect from a locally owned coffee shop complete with  eclectic decor artwork on the walls odds-and-ends of gaudy lamps and stained-glass windows.  The coffee is pretty good from what I have experienced.  The air-conditioning is right where it needs to be as well.   Most important factor for this business:  very nice staff.  That alone makes me want to come by more often.',4
'Stopped in to pick up some spices for my special rub and learned a lot from Zack. Ill be back.',4
'I dont have much differnt than the other 200 reviews. The pizza is amazing the antipasto always changes and the wait is horrible. Here is a good tip for a fun night out.   Go on a Wednesday put your name on the list then head over to the Art Museum (it is open till 9 on and FREE on Wednesdays). By the time you get back from the museum your table should be ready.',5
'i called the phone number 11-6-11 ... recording the number you dialed is not in service',1
'We were told this was the only location that was closest to us and the only one on way to the airport. Well thats kind of true. We were really wanting donuts before heading to the airport but made the mistake of going early Sunday morning which also happened to be Mothers Day. Good grief. The drive-through was jammed as was the line inside. Oh well. I had been dieting for this wedding and was fn hungry for something sweet for breakfast. As much as we wanted to try one of the local donut shops in Phoenix this worked for us. Maybe next time...',3
'We found this place through Priceline and were pleasantly surprised. The suites were of decent size the furniture was comfortable and the bed was terrific - an enormous king. The price was right the service was fine the hot tub was close and we didnt hear ANY other guests though the parking lot would suggest it was half-full on a weekend in February. Some negatives: the lighting in the kitchen was of the atrocious/squint-inducing fluorescent variety and the efficiency fridge was anything but: while I opened it twice in our whole weekend it ran constantly. Tsk tsk energy-efficiency-wardens.  Thankfully there was a door to close off the bedroom from the rest of the suite. Id go back though as the price is right and the location was fine. No noise from the road or neighborhood at all.',4
'Hmmm....where to start...the concept is great and the location is good but... and there are some BIG buts.....the parking is horrendous. ...second complaint is that happy hour ends at four (4)....what the @!#$. The wine list is not that impressive and cost 22.00 with tip for two glasses. I think that it might be the perfect place on a saturday or sunday where glasses of wine are $5.00 till four (4)...on the other hand Aiellos is RIGHT next door and has 1/2 priced appetizers and drinks till 6 pm and the food and service was wonderful but thats another review......',2
'A group of friends and I tried it out (was my second time eating here) last week and we ALL got sick. We all had different things and the food was greasy and gross. I do not recommend this place and I wont be back.',1
'We finally had dinner at basis on Tuesday night and we were very pleased. The only regret is that we did not go there sooner. We have lived in the area for 4 years and feel like we have missed out on many a delicious dinners! I had the special it was salmon and my husband had the beef medallions. They were excellent; no leftovers unfortunately to take home. We had to have dessert; creme brulee and ice cream with carmel sauce. Did I mention the half off glasses of wine? They have the deal on both Monday and Tuesday.  We were thrilled to have dined at such a simple delicious welcoming establishment and we look forward to getting back there again very soon.',5
'I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try. also try the Boba I think it is the best I have had but I have had it at only one other place. The staff is friendly and everything is pretty quick to order. no complaints so far.',5
'My favorite custard place  coffee custard or strawberry w/ hot fudge = AWESOME!!!',5
'My boss and I stayed here for 2 nights during a visit to ASU.  It was during the week so unfortunately we couldnt take advantage of the water park which we were BUMMED about!  The staff was incredibly friendly and efficient.  Seriously Im not sure if nicer people ever existed.  The entrance to the resort is nice and gives a great impression.  My room was bigger than my condo.  No lie.  It was huge - part of the Mountainside Villas and bigger than my boss room in the same section of rooms.  Now the downsides... it felt like a giant compound.  While my room was ginormous it didnt have a wow factor.  Recently renovated - yes.  There was a mysterious hole in the wall and the doors open to the outside which I hate.  Not that it was a deal-breaker - we got a ridiculously low rate so it was totally worth it.  The towels were nice and fluffy and the bed was comfy.  TVs could definitely use an upgrade - it reminded me of watching TV in college!  Id definitely stay there again - for what we paid it was an incredible value!  I wish we had been there longer to take advantage of the golf course and water park.  Had we been able to take advantage of the amenities I might have been convinced to give it another star.',3
'I normally order my Thai about a 4 out of 5.  I read the warning on Yelp about the heat so I ordered a 2.  It was too hot. I  dont know why a restaurant would use such a different scale than every other restaurant in town but that definitely detracted from my enjoyment of my meal.  It was ok food divey atmosphere but the service was friendly.  I wouldnt go out of my way to go back here as there are so many other fabulous Thai places in town.',2
'We decided to try this place rather than wait 2 hours for Bianco.  (Though we made BIanco a couple nights later.) Im glad we did.   The atmosphere is amazing.  A small early 1900s house turned into a restaurant.  Our section had only 3 tables.    We started with appetizers and we were NOT impressed.  We got Fried Octopus (okay but nothing great) Bonito potato chips (interesting flavor combo but not amazing) and Miso Bacon Eggplant (couldnt taste any bacon.)  The one appetizer we all liked was the panko breaded tofu which was excellent.   We were a little worred when our next dish wasnt amazing either.  We tried a shrimp over cucumber salad dish.  The shrimp was okay but the whole dish was missing something.   However the meal took a great 180 after that point.  Next was a whitefish dish which had 6 thin cuts of fish served on a plate garlic peppers and some other seasoning.  Hot oil is poured over the fish at your table to slightly cook the fish.  AMAZING.  Its served with bread for dipping into the oil afterwards.  THIS IS A PERFECT DISH.    Pork Bun:  MUST HAVE!  I love pork belly buns and this one rivals David Changs.  The pork is amazing the bun was perfect.   Curry Lamb Chops:  AMAZING.  Absolutely the best lamb I have ever had.  Ive never had lamb I really loved before but this dish was perfect...simply perfect.   Overall a great meal.  I do think they need to work on their appetizers which is what kept it from five stars.  I would definitely come back.',4
'Whats with the swimming pool in the outfield? This is baseball people not Mall of America. Why would you pay that much money for tickets to a ball game and decide to spend it goofing off in a pool. I could think of better ways to spend my money. I will admit the selection of drinks beers and food was pretty good and I walked the entire park and it was entertaining. Growing up on Sheffield St. 6 blocks away from Wrigley Field might have some reason why I only gave it 3 stars but its not a mall or is it?',3
'Thank you Yelp. I just received an email with Yelpers reviews of Burritos. Usually the recommendations are far and away or not fitting my food mood. However La Condesa was right in my wheelhouse.   The location is ok but the interior is spotless and fun. Lots of Day of the Dead and Luce Libre to enjoy while you choose salsa from the 12 or so available. Did I mention that there are a lot of salsas? For a condiment king like me this is heaven. Peanut and Pecan Salsa WHAT!?! Both were tasty and new flavors. Mayan Cochinita Burro jumped off the menu. I had beverage ordering anxiety and caved to the Horchata. Best Horchata Ive had. There are nuts strawberries and other tasty floaters in it. The burro came and it was lava-esque. I couldnt touch it for 20 mins. Luckily I had salsafest 2011 to keep me busy. The burro finally returned from the sun and it tasted delicious. Melt in your mouth stewed pork and refried beans in a possibly homemade tortilla. Ill be back.   $12 Food drink and Salsafest.',4
'i bring random things here *cough* Guns *cough* when i need some quick weekend cash. nice people sometimes they seem standoffish but are actually really nice.  my buddy Manuel works here. the funny story is we discovered allot in common after i pawned my ipod. haha. then we ran into each other at the brickhouse during a hip-hop show...i forget which one. oh well. cool ass mofo.   this place always get two thumbs up from me and i tell people if they need a pawn go to windy city. Yelp!',4
'Rude staff. Upon arrival I noticed three employees with unhappy looks on their faces and immediately thought to myself this is not going to be a pleasant experience. To my surprise I was greeted by one of the staff while the others ignored me. You have to imagine this is a small store and everyone is with in talking distance to each other. I told the staff that greeted me that I was here for my 6months checkup of the two purchases I made within the year. I was then asked if I had brought my paperwork with me. I replied that I did not bring any paperwork with me and asked if my information could be found with a name search. The staff member seemed irritated and said she could run a search but data isnt always found. She continues to ask me when I made the purchase I replied within the past 6months. Then a 2nd employee interrupts and pretty much scolded me and said you should always bring paperwork with you. I replied that I was told paperwork wasnt necessary when I first made the purchase. Then the 3rd employee says in a snarky tone I believe it says in the paperwork to bring the paperwork. I reply again that I was told paperwork wasnt necessary upon purchase.  Overall I felt like I was being attacked by the employees of Kay jewelers. As most people would say if you are unhappy with your job then find another one. Those employees give Kay jewelers a bad rep and I would think twice about returning for future purchases.',1
'The Living Room is pretty good especially for a restaurant in Chandler. The Sangria isnt great but its decent. The prime rib sliders are very good except when the kitchen over cooks the buns.  The wait staff is very laid back and friendly the crowd is usually an interesting mix of people.  Bottom line: good for happy hour grab a drink and a bite...',3
'CASH ONLY!  How is it that I always forget that this place is cash only?  That aside this place is great and my kids love getting bahamarama mammas.  My advice - avoid sugar-free syrups they do something to the ice to make it harder and the ice doesnt seem to soak up the flavor as well.  I always regret it.  If you avoid sugar-free the ice is super soft and sometimes you might even forget that its shaved ice youre enjoying.  Wish there was a Bahama Bucks in Chandler down by me!',4
'I want to love this place but I just dont. Everytime I eat here I wish I were eating at Olive Garden.... For a chain I just dont have any memorable items that Id come back for (as opposed to Olive Gardens crack like breadsticks)  Meh',2
'My wife and I have been making the trek to Arcadia for years now and have always said if they ever put a Postino in Gilbert it would be game over.  Diary read - its happened!  The place has always been known for great wine selection unbeatable bruschetta and friendly service and the new Gilbert location definitely doesnt disappoint.  They have a friendly response to every question and a recommendation for every taste; they simply dont care if youre a wine expert or a first time visitor they are just happy youre there.  Its so nice to have a chic place like this in downtown Gilbert.  As we drove through on Friday night the downtown area was bustling with couples and families alike.  Milling around between the Big 3 of Liberty Market Joes BBQ and Postino and there was a sense of buzz and community - it was very exciting to see.    A few recommendations:  1. Dont be afraid of the Tomato Jam Bruschetta.  Its delicious and while it sounds strange is arguably their best board. 2. Every day (yes even on the weekends) between 11am and 5pm they offer $5 glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  Were not talking cheap wine and Bud Light either.  ANY glass of wine and beer is up for grabs so spoil yourself a little bit! 3. If its just two of you take a seat at the bar and strike up a conversation with the bartenders and the fellow wine-goers.  Weve done this at each location and have found ourselves enjoying our time better than just getting tucked away by ourselves. 4. The Salted Caramel Sundae is the best dessert in town.  Period.  Have fun and make a night of it - youll be glad you did!',5
'Being from out of town I was out of my comfort zone stepping into a movie theater to watch something. Im used to my Regal Cinemas or my AMC and all the things that go with that. This particular Harkins at SanTan Village is a reasonable substitute.  Pluses:  1) The rewards shirt and cup. The shirt is 20 clams and the cup is 5 clams. If you wear the shirt (good up to the end of the year) it gives you free popcorn. If you bring the cup with you its a dollar refill. OMG how cool is that? 2) This particular theater sells concessions normally not associated with a movie theater. Things like french fries popcorn chicken mozzarella cheese sticks and churros are on sale here. This is IN ADDITION to the normal fare of popcorn hotdogs pretzels and candy that theaters normally have. 3) They have a place that you can leave your little ones AKA children if you wish to watch the movie without them possibly screaming.  Minuses: (Keep in mind Im from out of town)  1) We dont have any Harkins close to where I live. The one closest to my home location is about 30 miles. 2) Im actually going to miss this theater chain when I leave the metro Phoenix area. Blame it on me wanting something I dont have.  Last words:  ---sigh. Why is it that things that are nifty and fun are found so far far away? Its like an empty cookie jar. You go reach for it you cant get it. You get a stool to reach for it but you still cant. You go get a chair and you fall off of it and hurting yourself. Finally you get a ladder and you get to it only discovering that the jar is empty. ----sigh.  I will be back Harkins. Save a loyalty cup for me!',4
'I think I just gained 10 pounds by looking at the Bakery case. I told my five year old to be careful and not get her hand prints all over the glass but I think I was being just as bad. Im kicking myself now for walking away with nothing but I couldnt make up my mind. Everything looked so good and they have a great selection of different items.  I love this store. Today was probably the busiest I have seen it (lunch time on a Wednesday) but it was easy to get around. The deli could have used some more staff. I was going to get the pizza special but decided against it because we were waiting for too long.  They carry some great items and are reasonably priced but if you are expecting Frys type deals you wont find it here. Yes its part of a chain (a local one at that) but not a big box fluorescent lighted SUPERmarket.  The only area I dont like is checkout. One cashier...on a Wednesday at lunch rush. She called for two other people to come help but they didnt show. Instead the Store Director hopped on register to help...always happy to see a manager jump in where needed.',4
'Ive been a loyal fan of Johnnies since before I was born. The quality is consistent and always good. Johnnie (as it seems most people call him) is courteous and professional and is always fun to talk with. His product is delivered quick and delicious and is one of a kind in the midtown area. Hes been in the business for 27 years and is finally closing up in March of 14-get there quick if you want to have the chance to try a great dog.',5
'Yum.  Better yet fun reasonably-priced yum.  We sat at a community table up front and met a couple of nice folks who were thrilled with their dinner.  Our sake the recommendation of our server was delicious.  And the asian tapas as I believe Sens calls them were so good that we had trouble stopping ordering them.  We got steak on a rock wasabi tofu pork and shrimp dumplings panko shrimp and a few others.  Everything tasted fresh and distinct--I dont remember specifics as its been a month or so but I recall repeated flavor explosions.  Service was fun.  Johnny stopped by to say hi and was humble and cool as always.  The DJ played some grooves I hadnt heard before and the overall vibe was festive.  Well be back for sure.',4
'Took some time finding a place that did custom made orthotics that went through insurance and were made without molding. I will reiterate what the other reviewers have said in saying the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   I was impressed by the meticulous nature in which I was helped in just getting orthotics.   I was referred to Endurance by Runners Den.',5
'The best Japanese restaurant in Arizona.  Fresh varied and the staff were cool.',5
'The store is ok but dont think we will be back. The stock was limited and items werent marked nor did they have prices (or the prices were confusing). Save a trip and visit Reefmonsters or The Pet Shop which are both in the same general area.',2
'Soooo much better than Starbucks! The menu is relatively small which makes it much more pleasurable to place an order since its not as overwhelming.    We tried both the iced vanilla latte and the iced agave latte. Both were excellent with a wonderful coffee flavor that went well with the slight sweetness of both the vanilla and the agave. I cant drink lattes at Starbucks theyre always way too sweet but I sure can at Cartel!  Fun funky environment and really nice employees.',4
'People rag on them but when you consider the volume of people they have to deal with I think they handle it really well.  Expect a wait but not because they are slow.  Its because they have 50-100 people ahead of you when you arrive.  At one person per minute thats still an hour to get to you.  And sometimes they are calling numbers faster than 1 per minute.  We had to wait but the crowd was large and the lady was helpful and efficient.  We were done in 5 minutes or so.  Plus a short wait after for them to print the card.  Beware the restrooms however.  What is it with people?  Cant they aim?  Really?!  I shudder to think what their homes must look like if thats the best they can do!!  Cmon fellow citizens!  Its not that difficult to hit the water in the bowl and flush the silly thing when youre done!  Sheesh.',3
'As far as cupcakes go this place is great! Yea yea yea I know its expensive get over it! One cupcake is like a full dessert and you know its expensive going in so stop complaining. Alright thats off my chest now...  The red velvet cupcake is amazing the frosting is unreal. I also like the banana the muffin part tastes like really good banana bread. I also enjoy the peanut butter chocolate carrot black & white pumpkin and milk chocolate. There are a couple I dont love like lemon and chocolate marshmallow.   Overall the really good ones are excellent great for birthdays and other special occasions that give you an excuse to go here.',5
'D I S A P P O I N T E D!  I had long put off my visit to CD but this last Friday was the day. We arrived and was greeted by a gentleman that I wasnt sure if he worked there or not but soon it would turn out he was our server for the evening.   He was very attentive and answered any and all question we might have had even though the answers was straight off the menus description of the same items. But he took our drink order and brought it out shortly. From this moment he circled our table and frequently stopped by asking if we wanted to put in a entrée-order - right after we have got our very extensive appetizer selection. (I found this very odd because there is no way that we would been even halfway done with our apps before our entrée would have been ready.) From this minute our waiter stopped checking on us in fact he might have left the restaurant and we had no service at all.   *Food I imagined this to be a culinary gem but as nice as their cheeses are.. I must say I was greatly disappointed in the meal; most of all the hyped Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I cannot believe how this is raved about. The soft pretzels are most certainly not baked on the premises and the Fondue could be made my Kraft. Shitty shitty shitty and overpriced.   *Service A place like CD needs to have great to outstanding service but I found it to be the crappiest experience I have ever had in Scottsdale. Our snot nosed waited should be fired and the rest of the eclectic bunch are so inattentive when we tried to flag them down mainly for the check once we had been ignored for an hour. AN HOUR!  (By eclectic I mean that it is hard to see who is working there due to the extreme casual dress-suggestion of the waitstaff. Normally I am all for this because you usually can pick out the waiters/waitresses by behavior and attitude. Nopes!)  *Ambiance Here is the stars! Its a nice big place CD have here in Scottsdale and even if I think the chandeliers is a bit much I like the layout and the bar area very much. Even the furniture. This is nice on many levels. This is where I give two stars since the rest is extremely overrated.   *Overall The food is substandard and I tried all over the appetizers. All over. I mean the Entrees could technically be divine but then you might have to order it straight to the chef and pick it up yourself. I would have loved to have spoken to a manager about the lack of service - but the absence of service even made this into a mission for Ethan Hawke (if hed choose to accept it).   I will not come back. Unless it is to have a dinner meeting with a manager.',2
'I remember staying here once when my air conditioning at the house broke over the summer and I was not prepared to live in an oven...  Its your average Hilton Garden Inn. Youve seen one youve seem them all homogenized without fault. The rooms are tight but its not a resort so dont expect top-notch anything. The location was convenient  though near many great restaurants and such.   The staff were helpful should you ask a question. The place wasnt very crowded I can imagine sitting there in silence would be pretty boring and they were engaging when I spoke with them. Sweet.  The pool was large which I really liked. I had the whole thing to myself. :)',4
'The food is mediocre.  I had chicken katsu--the chicken was cooked to death.  The music is way too loud.  The service is absolutely horrible.  The bar is incredibly slow; twenty minutes for two drinks.  The server was rude and she forgot to enter part of our order.  I will never go back.',1
'Love it and the coffee is even better than the gelato! They just began serving food and I cant wait to try their pizza and pannis!',4
'The food here is fantastic.  I have been here many times and am always impressed with the service and food.  Their patio is dog friendly which is important to me.  I recommend the fish dishes and the fried rice.  Also the hot and sour soup is the perfect food for a cold day.  The staff here is helpful and friendly and very professional.',5
'I was in the area and yelp for a nearby nail shop. Paulene nail came up so i drop by to get my pedi and gel nail done. Right when i walk in i was greeted ask to sign in and got seated right away. The place was really spacious and super clean. I was offer water which was nice. Considering it was warm outside. But no worry air conditioning was on thank god!  My overall service for pedicure was topnotch. My pedi wasnt rush like some other nail salon. The lady took her time on me. She wasnt pushy trying to add on my stuff and over charge me later.  My gel manicure was also terrific. They had a good selection of color. It could be more but they offer more than the old place i go to so cant complain there.  I definitely would recommend this place. You wont regret stopping by :)',5
'Bevmo....did you see this guy?   Total Wine is my boo. I shall be faithful and loyal to the aggrandizing store in which you are and in which you hold dominion over all.  R\_  Note: dont get tooooo cocky TW.',5
'Ate there for bday dinner amazing. I dont give 5 stars out often but this place is it. King crab melts in mouth as does filet mignon. Pricey so special occasions only (was $185 for two) but worth it.',5
'I attended the Brittlebush Beer Dinner with Phoenix Ale Brewery and Fretzy was speaking at the beer dinner (check out the other beer dinners at the Brittlebush at Westin Kierland) and encouraged us all to come down and check out the brewery so I did. I walked in and met the other partner in the brewery George Hancock who was warm and welcoming and walked me into the brewery to give me a little personal tour. Being interested in the brewing process it was great to get the education from one of the owners. He handed over some knowledge tastings and beers and it was a great experience. Heres to local brewers with good tastebuds and big heart!',4
'We came here last night for a friends birthday dinner.  We made a reservation so we were seated vey quickly. As soon as we were seated we were served warm garlic bread that was quite tasty. We all got Caesar salads that were so delicious.  A friend and I split the eggplant sorrentino and it was great. The sauce was very fresh and light. The entrees claim to come with a side of pasta and sauteed veggies. The veggie we got was literally 1 piece of broccoli on each plate. Another disappointing thing was they charge a $5 sharing fee so by the time we got the check we realized we should have just gotten our own dishes for about the same price. Another odd thing was that the only thing our server did was take our orders and give us the check. The bus boy refilled our drinks brought out our dishes cleared our plates etc. the lighting is kind of dark but there is nice ambiance. I would probably eat here again.',4
'Good coffee and tasty snacks.',4
'Best bar in Tempe!!!',5
'Where do you bring your family of 16 when no one can figure out what they want? Here!! There is something for everyone on their extensive but limited menu and they can piece together any combination of sauce or pasta to satisfy any picky eater. My rowdy family ordered nearly the entire menu and the staff helped corral all of us and arrange the tables so we could all sit together. Definitely this was a very amiable and delicious restaurant where I am sure we will visit again.',4
'I got Annie tickets for my birthday.  I was so excited.  We got here and it was very nice set up.  We walked in to the main theatre and it was dinning tables set up and classy set up.  Loved the feel of the place.  Everyone was dressed up nicely.  We had pretty good seats.  The staff was great.',4
'For those who are used to shopping at wal-mart for everything this is not your kind of place. This store serves two different kinds of people. Those with lots of money and those looking for hard to find items. I was feeling like trying something a little different so I went to this location hoping to find a few rare gems.  Big huge thick brownies that look like they where stolen from a food network set ( did they kidnap Paula Dean?) along with a chocolate skyscraper they call a cake. They are one of the few places one can find heirloom tomatoes and real andouille sausage.   Plus if you get food stamps they take those to (dont act like you never used them before)! I recommend at least checking this place out if you are tired of the same old bargain bag run of the meal selection of produce and meats. And while they do charge you an arm and a leg for things you can at least feel superior to most while you very slowly eat your $2.00 apple.    LOL',3
'OK a lobster cobb salad for over $30 and one of the very best prime rib dinners I have EVER eaten (also over $30)...  If I had the time and the money I could LIVE here. Sure we waited.  We waited long time. But Flemings love us long time too.  The calamari appetizer was cooked to perfection and the special lobster bisque was equally incredible.  Our server was kinda hot very eloquent and easily served our table of twelve with no issues.  My biggest issue was with the party I was with because they simply didnt want to leave...    One of the greatest tourist restaurant experiences ever.  HOWEVER...  I have to ding this establishment a star for not having free/any wifi...  Because thats how we roll in the new millennium...  Try the pomegranate margarita.  SERIOUSLY.',4
'Find this place on a whim. So glad I did. Well def be one of my go To The drinks were so good and flavorful and I could taste the liquor. Food was also good. Went for happy hour. Will be back to chill outside with a bottle of wine very soon',4
'Ive been going to this place for about a year and I can say Ive never been disappointed. The salads selection is great the drinks are great  and the best thing of all is that you dont break the bank for some good food. My favorite salad is the Chopped Salad. - They have a good happy hour with a great selection of drinks. The service is good overall and I would recommend going there.',4
'As a lover of Middle Eastern food and being half Lebanese I found this place to be great. I had the kefta sandwich and enjoyed it. Also if you are looking for grocery items they have some great ingredients.',4
'My husband and I got married here 5 years ago. We were so happy with everything. The grounds are beautiful staff is professional was everything we could have asked for. Yes it is a long drive but well worth it there nothing like it in Phoenix',5
'Great food great people.  Try the kielbasa.  If they had a microbrew or two on the beer list Id give it 6 stars.',5
'Ive been waiting for this and today I got my chance to try out the Cornish Pasty Company.   I will tell you now this is a place for a true foodie. This is a dark restaurant one that puts you in the kitchen. Literally. If you find yourself disturbed by seeing real kitchen professionals running around then avoid this place.   Walking in I felt like I was going into a dive bar. All of the kitchen staff is motley and I loved it. We took two seats at the bar and were greeted by an awesome server. She got us Guinness (poured perfectly that gets a star) and we got to check out the menu.  Vast is a good phrase for this menu. If you havent had a Pasty before I like to think of it as a Hot Pocket that doesnt make you want to die.  I got the Cottage Pie Pasty and my friend got the Italian Pasty.   Our pasties were served on very distinct metal plates with a sauce side. I had a red wine gravy which was incredible. Tart and not thick at all. It was excellent. My friend had a marinara he replied that it had a nice spice to it.  The food was excellent. My Pasty was filled with ground beef potatoes peas carrots and cheese.  Warm gooey and it felt good being in there.  That is what I would say is the key to this place. You have to love it. You have to love feeling of the warmth every time the oven is opened along with the following scent of roasted herbs and spices. The staff rushing around looking more like roadies than cooking professionals.  This place is real. Its alive. And its good. Check out the menu and go there. I will be going as much as possible.',5
'So I visited this LA Fitness on a guest pass to see how I liked the facility. Thank God I never paid anything to go there.   When I showed my guest pass I had to present it to a young kid sitting at a desk who said hed take my drivers license that day as an exchange and Id just have to get it from him when I was done with my class. I thought it was weird that I didnt actually get an official pass but whatever.   So I return the next day and of course it was an issue. Not only that the GM basically reprimanded me for something his own worker failed to do AND called me a liar. When I produced my guest pass on my phone he annoyingly tossed it back at me. When he asked why I didnt have a membership already I told him that I kinda work at a fitness studio. He insulted my place of work by saying he had never heard of it. Obviously he hasnt its a womens only dance studio. Then he preceded to pitch me membership options and tell me about his son that is going to be a big rapper. Really? I never returned to finish my 9 days left of my guest pass even that wasnt worth it.   Just the fact that LA Fitness employs complete degenerates to run one of their locations doesnt bode well for the company itself. And judging from the lack of good reviews for this place without anything being changed well Im not sure I trust LA Fitness at all.  As for the 2 classes that I took they were ok but the mats that they provide are ridiculous - theyre clearly not cleaned and most of them are ripped apart.',1
'The best Thai Ive had on this side of town. The service was not the best but the food makes up for it. The owner is the daughter of Thai Basil in Tempe and you can tell. The food tastes great and the prices are great too.',4
'Ive eaten here several times.  Each time leaves me wanting something else.  The service is always slow. The staff is inattentive and our waitress was too busy on her phone to actually pay attention to us.  They werent even busy - I think there were 2 other people there the whole time.  If it was busy I could understand slow service - but it wasnt.  It was clearly a lack of caring and respect for the customers.  This is probably the 4th time that it has happened so I felt it was time to write a review.   Everything weve eaten here has been very good - albeit over-priced.  My complaint is not with the food but rather with the prices and the service.  They seem to be continually jacking up the prices on their menu - each time I am expecting to pay one price and ask about it and they are usually like oh we redid the menu and then they give some lame excuse as to why the prices have gone up.  They used to have a $10 lunch special that was good and worth dealing with the poor service - but they have since removed the special.  The excuse they gave me when I asked about it was: that they needed their menu to be the same for lunch and dinner and the lunch special added to the daily prep...... It was a pizza and salad for $10.  Then she informed me that I could order the same thing the salad and pizza separately (for an extra $6 vs the special)....... So no not really any extra prep.  I own several restaurants so I knew it was a poorly invented excuse to blame it on the prep. Its like just be honest and say that the special was temporary and they are not offering it anymore - no need to make stuff up.  Also this restaurant is weird about accepting their coupons.  The owners also own the Blu Burger next door (which is weird because service in there is usually much better than Ive ever had at Teatro - but Blu IS still pricey). Like I said the food is good - but unfortunately their poor service and expensive prices overrides the good food.   We wont be back.',1
'An angel from heaven was sent to earth to open a restaurant named Pita Jungle.  Amazing Grace how sweet the [ lental salad ] That saved a wretch like me.... I once was lost but now am found Was blind but now I see.  Blasphemy?  You cant judge me!',5
'The park has two parts to it: a nice open grassy area and an agility course. Its very nice and clean with a shaded patio area. My dog and I love it here! I usually go at around 5pm on the weekdays and it is quite crowded.  I never noticed that children under 12 were not allowed but Ive seen children in the area and no one seem to really care. There are plastic doggie bags water bowls and scoops available. The only thing to be careful about is that it does not separate small and big dogs....they play in one big area.',4
'Ive got at least thirty people hooked on ycs! They need to come to phoenix the foods worth my hour drive but I hate the expensive gas',5
'We come here a lot. One of our favorite go to places. They have amazing live music on the weekends and we can always count on great service and excellent food!  We are so lucky to have this close to home & love sharing such a great unique place with visitors & friends!',5
'Wow wow wow and wow!  I had no idea ice cream could be this amazing  They have a lot of unique flavors not because they want to be different but because they can make even the most esoteric flavors taste delicious.  Hands down my favorite is the toffee banoffee sundae.  The salted caramel drizzle alone is worth the trip. It makes me want to grab the squeeze-it bottle and suck on it like a baby.  Aside from the sundae my next favorite is the peaberry espresso ice cream.  Im not sure what a peaberry is but Im pretty sure its code for frickin delicious!  This is definitely the place to go to indulge yourself and impress your family or coworkers.  Funny tidbit my wife and I went here all the time while we were dating.  When I proposed I sent my wife on a scavenger hunt to all of our memorable and favorite places around the Valley.  The employees at Sweet Republic were gracious enough to help out and give my wife the last clue that directed her to the proposal spot.  Sweet Republic will always be a special place to us because of this.   Please open a location in Chandler or Tempe! :-)',5
'This gem is definitely the place to go for that boys night out for dinner. Single buddy throwing a BDay party? Dinner here first!  Vibe: The atmosphere is straight gangster! Like actually gangster. Durants is a former hangout of 1930s gangsters. Reason enough to come here. The Bartenders are probably the classiest and best in the valley. Dont tell them a drink tell them a type of liquor and they will recommend a masterpiece. However this is the type of place you go to and drink a Glenlivet 18year.   Food: No contest a top 5 steak in the valley. Their prime rib is probably top 2. Even their $19 burger is delicious but dont get that.. Get the Rib-eye on your first visit!  The only negative due to its age is the bathroom is small and kinda GRO! However the first time you take a friend I like to screw with them and tell them the bathrooms are baller and they should check them out... Friends always back confused like I dont know what baller means.',5
'I had a burger & fries.  Good service good food but too expensive.  They even charged me for requested BBQ sauce kinda offensive.',3
'Cant say enough about how much i love this place. Everything is good. Dont expect luxury scenery just DAMN GOOD FOOD!!',5
'My husband and I just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago. One of the things we missed most (even after a few weeks) was the amazing quality ethnic food.  We are big fans of Indian cuisine. It is our go-to comfort food when we return from a long trip and need something warm spicy and complex.  We each had a craving on Saturday night and gave Indian Paradise a try.  We ordered carry out and they recommended a comparable lamb dish to my favorite dish at our Chicago place. So I had the Rogan Josh and my husband went with his favorite Tikka Masala naan and samosa.  Everything was delicious! We are so excited to be able to have our new Indian place here in Arizona. I cannot wait to try their vegetarian options next time.',4
'omg what the heck did I do? I came here again by mistake. Ordered the Satay. That is noooo chicken. Again inedible. Well they havent gotten any better in 2 years. Jeez I knew this place looked familiar.',1
'Formerly Legends Cadillac. Will continue review later mentioning good maintenance service and rep Luke. Use to be able to rent a car but doing away with that all together. Buying a car was less enjoyable that the quality maintenance which is crucial in deciding if I buy my next car from here. Awesome lobby with TV and fresh snacks and Starbucks coffee. Cupcakes and bagels too.',4
'I love the karaoke on Tuesday nights. Great songs I cant find anywhere else with Amber and Kenny Amy the bartender has awesome weekly specials and the crowd is much more hip and friendly than most other karaoke places. My boyfriend and I go weekly and even though its not a gay bar we feel welcome and comfortable.',5
'Great selections and prices. Super easy to find what I need. They offer coupons both on items and off total purchases as well as specials on products needing to be consumed by the end of the day. I like many of the house brand products especially unsweetened organic soy milk eat well frozen meals and the tortilla chips. I love that they clearance out low sellers such as certain scents of laundry detergent or cleaning products etc.  I have been shopping at this location for about 6 months and plan to continue until I am no longer in the neighborhood.',5
'High end for high maintenance. If youre looking to make a serious crack in your credit card Id suggest taking it here. The decor is very nice the people not so much. If you dont look like you belong i.e. having white straw bleached fake blond hair and a faux tan then youll probably get snubbed by at least one of the other shoppers or a store clerk. Not really my style but 3 stars for the nice building and fixtures.',3
'I always leave Press Coffee with buyers remorse. Im finally writing this reveiw because Im done giving them generous chances and my money. The coffee here is only okay. As a coffee lover you will find it to be very acidic and biting (coffee can actually be made to taste good and not just dark or high caffeine). I guess its a quarter step above Starbucks quality but thats not saying much. Im not even really sure it is better. Ive ordered a pastry here once. It was dry and falling apart. I would compare it to a sand castle put together with sugar. The cashier seemed reluctant to get it out. She must have known it was awful.  I would probably be slightly more generous reviewing the quality of the coffee if the customer service wasnt so horrendous. This is a problem that plagues most of Scottsdale but I still dont understand the practice of being snooty/annoyed at your customers. Maybe the employees need to drink more of their product? I have never seen one smile in the times Ive been in here. Most of the time the expressions range from what are YOU doing in here to Im so bored and I decided to suck on a lemon. Last time I was there I literally did 100% of the talking with the cashier. I find that to be weird in any situation but its really bad for a retail/service employee.   Beyond the attitude of the clerks something weird happens every time Im in Press Coffee. Once the computer broke down and I waited without acknowledgment while the woman called for help. Another time the clerk stopped me from picking up my coffee so he could take a picture of it. Earlier this year I had been sitting outside with my computer for a couple hours and decided to get another drink. When I went inside to order the cashier says Youre having another one!?! I wish I would have said no and left but I felt awkward and already committed to it.  Im sorry. I thought you pour liquid into a cup for a living. I thought I was paying you to do that for me.  You dont have to take my word for it. You can walk past Press Coffee almost anytime and find it empty. That is a big indicator as it is the only place to get coffee at Scottsdale Quarter. Do yourself a favor and walk across to Kierland for another option.',1
'Somehow I did not realize that the little cafe in the Galleria office building had a listing on Yelp; so even though I have been eating here consistently for the last 3 years I have not written a review. Time to remedy that!   The best thing about Cafe Conmigo is the people who work there. The owner and her young friendly staff are always cheerful and very accommodating. They get the food to you fast but still every order is prepared fresh and to your specifications. You can even order ahead so that you can do a quick pick up if are expecting a short lunch.   For breakfast they serve up Starbucks style coffee drinks (lattes cappuccinos etc) that are very well done with every flavor syrup you could possibly want plus the usual toppings of cinnamon nutmeg etc available. Unfortunately the prices are almost as high as Starbucks. However their other items are very reasonable. They have bagels and pastries to grab on the go and also so egg sandwhiches/burritos and other hot options. Also fresh fruit is always available which is nice. Usually bananas and grapes.   For lunch I am not a big sandwhich person but all the salad options are good though unfortunately the dressings are usually chilled to the point that the olive oil has solidified (that kind of grosses me out). The best thing by far is the soups. A new one every day but they are always amazingly good. They come with crackers or you can order pita bread or a half sandwhich combo. They also have a daily special lunch which can range from tacos to pasta to just about anything. It is almost always very good and so that is usually a safe bet for a cheap tasty lunch.   I highly recommend Cafe Conmigo. It is super-convenient for anyone working in the Galleria building but even if you are just shopping in the area it is one of the quickest cheapest options in the area.  There is not much in the way of seating in the actual cafe area but there are comfy chairs and couches scattered around the first floor Galleria atrium.  A great way to bask in the sunshine without being exposed to the heat!',4
'Ive been going to The Parlor since right after it opened and I have yet to have a bad meal there.  Get the meat and cheese board to start a yummy bottle of wine and the Pesto Chitarra (sp?).    They are super fast for takeout as well if you need a fix but dont have the time to linger over a lunch or dinner.    The patio at night has some great ambiance with white lights and a fireplace.',5
'This was a stop on my wine crawl (same as a pub crawl but we only drink wine) with girlfriends. It was a beautiful saturday afternoon so we sat outside. We ordered 2 appitizers apricot chicken skewers & lobster/shrimp tarts which were very tasty; and since we got there a little before thier 4:00 happy hour the waitress waited till 4 to ring in our drink order which was great since it was 2 for 1. Our waitress was great. Will be going here again.',4
'Ive been back several times since my first visit and the food and service are just as good. Drive-thru is very convenient.  Weve tried several more variety of tortas and the hard tacos and nothing has disappointed us.   Weve noticed that the tortas are better if you can eat them there because the bread gets a little soggy on the transport home but they still have the same great taste.',5
'I was going to give this place three stars and then realized there really isnt any reason to.  While it is cheap ($6 the night we went with free nachos and soda) in this case you get what you pay for.  The rink surface was nice but the roller skates were crappy and the back of the place smelled like urine.  There is also no air-conditioning just fans.  If you really want to go skating and are looking for an adventure give it a shot.  If youre looking for a classy date spot keep looking.',2
'This was the second time have ordered take out and again it dake on Pho and idnt disappoint. I had the Caldo de Pollo con Fideo Chino and I loved it. Try it!',4
'Thank goodness for Las Cruces bringing the best Mexican food to the valley.  I lived in Las Cruces and Im telling you they have THE best Mexican restaurants ever.  Si Señor in Cruces is not even one of the best ones but its way better than anything Ive had living 10 years in Albuquerque.  From the signage in the front to the moment I walked in the door it looked like the one at home.  Just like I remember it.  Love the picture right in the front with the Organ mountains in the background.  Ok ok enough reminiscing onto the food.  I loved the salsas.  Havent had the green chile salsa in a while but it was yummy.  The red was hot a good hot.  I ordered a combo and everything was just delicious.  I honestly judge a true Mexican restaurant by their rice.  Its been a while since Ive had some decent rice and this one was very tasty.  I wish there had been more on the plate. And lastly the sugary sopas were the icing on the cake.  Finger licking good!  So glad this place is here a bit of a drive but totally worth it to me to make me feel like I have something just like home.',5
'This Goodwill is a disgusting stinky disorganized picked over mess.  I have never found something that was even worth the trip here.     Skip this one and go to the one at 16th Street and Indian School Road.    Trust me youll thank me later.',1
'These people have a hard job. People complain about things all day long. I love this store and their people. Super patient and nice.',5
'Holy Moly Im shocked Sandstone doesnt have a better review!  Talk about a family owned business where theyll not only remember your name but come around the bar and give you a hug when  you stop by!  The drink prices are great generously mixed and its always a fun laid back crowd.  Want different music?  Just ask or plug your ipod in.  And who doesnt love video poker?!  We held a charity function here where Jeff cooked us a special steak dinner hired extra help and about killed himself ensuring the event was amazing.  Ill come back time and time again to support this amazing family owned business by having some drinks with my girls.  Whats better in Chandler?  The dbags youll meet at Sandbar?  No thanks!    And PS- The steak was amazing!  :)',5
'Paid $12 to pass the barriers.  Stood in line for 20 mins to get ID checked for wristband for beer tent.  Stood in line to buy tickets.  Stood in line for 1 BBQ place for 40 mins paid $10 for a small brisket sandwich vendor took cash - tickets not needed.  No way to try each BBQ joint w/o standing in 20-30 min lines.   Not worth it',1
'I love this place!  Its so fun to feed the animals. You can even get in with the goats. They have an 11 minute train ride organic produce for purchase and delicious treats. Its free to get in.',5
'I am salivating as I think about Sacks - sits on ASU campus - off Mill and the visitor parking lot behind COOR. During the semester it is PACKED for lunch. But they are pretty good about moving through the line. The sandwich options are many the quality of ingredients is excellent and you get a cookie with every wich.   Theres a Subway across the street but if you are in the mood for a REAL sandwich with exceptional quality this is your place. I recommend the Veggie - one of the best versions of this I have ever had. (Average sandwich plus drink and side will run $9-12)',4
'This is a huge store and love that the clothes were sized.  There is a separate room for housewares and a bit messy.  Some of the housewares stuff was dirty but great deals. They were running a 50% sale on all items in the store blue red or white.  Own parking lot.',4
'Lee and Rhonda you guys are great people.  We had the best horseback ride and the kids are still talking about it.  They loved the stories the guide told Preston.  He was hysterical.  The scenery was amazing I love and got some great pics of the saguaro cactus.   My horse Picasso was well behaved which i was really glad as I have not ridden in quite sometime.   The whole setup was great..  having the western town with the pet pigs so cute!  Anyhow great service and fun!  I recommend this place to everyone.',5
'I lived in a apartment belongs to this company for 1 year and 3 months and here are my comments. Pros: large rooms good service team.  Cons:  1. Pricy. For a apartment in the middle of no where they charge over a $1000 for a one bed and jack the rent 10% every year. 2. Highly greedy. They tried to rob me two months early termination fee without stating in lease; trying to take all my security deposit for cleanning even I have done my part well enough. 3. Management team is good when you paying the rent once you want to leave they turned into cold stones. Trying to take as many penny as they can. 4. 200 people with only one pool that is shared with another apartment building total of 500 people in summer but only one pool to use. 5. Laundry room is horrible. Water leak a lot.  Dont recommend to live with this companys property at any level. I am an angry customer who dont felt being treated correctly.',1
'Over the past couple of years Ive become very passionate for cooking at home. When Im not eating out Im looking up a recipe on Epicurious Chow or Food.com for a recipe that pushes my boundaries as cook. Lately Ive been working to perfect my ability to braise pork and beef. It is therefore very important to me to find the ingredients I want since Im working to pin down my techniques before I feel more comfortable experimenting with ingredients and flavors.  This particular Frys is my go-to grocery store.  I shop here for my daily necessities and usually start here when Im looking to cook something up from a recipe. Unfortunately as I start to diversify my cooking ability it has become more and more difficult to find what I need. I understand that Frys isnt really the spot for finding unique grocery items like baby artichokes but it definitely has become frustrating that I end up spending 30 minutes looking around for what I need without someone in sight to assist only to give up or find out that it is not stocked. Its a bit too after-the-fact for them to ask upon checkout Did you find everything alright?  In the recent past Ive started my shopping at Frys and then worked my way over to other grocery stores for the other items. Ive shopped for my other items at Sprouts Whole Foods and AJs. If cooking something extravagant I may need to shop exclusively at one of those instead of splitting my time between Frys and one of the others.   Selection aside you really cannot beat Frys on price for a lot of their standard grocery items especially meat and produce. Walmart and Target sometimes offers cheaper prices for canned bottled and boxed products. Im not a huge consumer of those so Ill continue shopping at Frys for my day-to-day items.',3
'Im a bit torn in scoring here so Im just going to list some positives/negatives.   Positives   1. There are few other nail/spa pedicure/waxing places in the area. (Though one is going in just down the street.)  2. Their prices are less than some places Ive been in more competitive parts of town.  3. It looks very clean  4. While I hear the typical talking to each other I dont hear so much that sounds like they are actively making fun of the clients which is a nice change.   Negatives   1. Because there is nothing else in the area Ive had to wait a few times - though even this isnt too bad.  2. This is really my #1 and main problem with them.  Man - I almost hate to say this but speaking a certain level of English is pretty important when you are trying to explain things like That tingles more than normal or even to ask for certain services.  It took 3 people to understand the first time I wanted a brow wax - and its listed on a sign in the front window.  Then - on my 3rd Brow wax there English took on a stronger meaning.  I explained to the girl how I wanted it Thick very thick even using my fingers to show BIG in case there was a question as she also had to get someone else to understand why I was there. She said Yes.  Yes.  I understand.  Yes.  I ended up with thin very thin. She offered to take more off it it would make me happier.  These are important distinctions. I felt a bit like an alien.   So while I wont be going there again for awhile its not a bad place at all.  Just make sure the person helping you is TOTALLY clear on what you want and Im sure youll be fine.',3
'Went here last night for the first time. Excellent service! Our server Ryan checked on us frequently and always made sure we had what we needed. The bus boy Anthony helped with keeping the chips bean dip and salsa full. My girlfriend had the fundito and I had the Fajitas. Both were excellent and well priced (even without a coupon). The lake and lighted fountain made for a next scenery while we enjoyed our dinner. Will definitely be returning soon.',5
'This place looks like a bag of skittles and smells like toasty pop tarts and is the best spot to pick up a gift for your girlfriend or a friend that so happens to be a girl.   My gal pal and I recently took a detour into Charming Charlie on our way to Happy Hour and she went absolutely bonkers. I call it the pin ball effect.  She was able to methodically cover the entire store and make it to the cashier with two nifty bags two pair of sandals a dress and an extremely large hat in just under 20 minutes. I teased her about scoping out the joint on a previous visit but she insists she was born to shop. She was quite the pro and all smiles post check out.   Its moments like this that remind me that happiness can be bought.  I prefer to get my happy at the bar across the way.',4
'Bob is the best! Honest calm fair. Hes done my friends car work for years helped find great deals on cars and just tonight diagnosed and fixed my coolant leak at no charge! He also told me about the most common problems with my car and how to avoid them (and their costs).   Excellent local businessman.  The friendly curious cats are a bonus.',5
'I was hoping this place would be good since I live nearby. Tried the food here once. They forgot to include part of the order. The food is average and Very Overpriced. Stacys makes the entire neighborhood smell like a burning dumpster. The smell is so nauseating that I could never bring myself to eat here again. Walk by the building at night and you will see what I mean. It has to be incredibly filthy to smell so awful when they are not covering up the stench with the odor of cooking meat.',1
'Pretty decent place went here with my best friend. Tried their Hummus Trio and loved it!',4
'Was anxiously awaiting the opening of Chop Shop with the concept of a healthy lunch under $10 - in Old Town Scottsdale. Sound too good to be true? Verdict: very close.  Expanding on the space from the previous place (Big Bs Hangover) at first blush my impression of Chop Shop was cute crowded and friendly. The patio has been expanded and was almost fully occupied around noonish. Inside a small line awaited where a super friendly order-taker manned the register. No ordinary order-taker however he described the tri-tip to a customer explaining he was a meat man with genuine enthusiasm and impressive menu knowledge.   Greeted with a big smile I ordered the trip tip sandwich telling him it was based on his recommendation. He explained he was talking about the OTHER tri-tip selection (the protein dish) but my choice was equally excellent- with apple and horseradish sauce making it tangy. Sold!  I ordered an iced tea delivered right there at the counter and given a number for table delivery. Grabbed a deuce by the window and waited no more than 5 for my sandwich and salad to arrive.  Plated unceremoniously but green-ly on an open-faced cardboard carry out I was slightly disappointed to see that the whole wheat bread was a like a pita only in halves. Seeing the tri-tip was cut into cubes I was sure my sammy was going to be dropping meat bombs like a Sam Kinison buffet. No worries - the bread held up for a very G-rated lunch experience.   The side salad was straight chopped greens but with a thin and sweet viniagrette. Punch this puppy up with some vinegar and seasoning and happy I will be.  As for the sandwich the meat was tender not overdone. The apples and splash horseradish were good complements but again some use some KICK. The feint of heart dont order horseradish! I ended up grabbing some Sriracha to add more flavor-boost.   Overall there is promise and I will be back to try more soon.   Some notes to management:  First suggestion: move the espresso machine with cups piled high on top (which hides the bottom half of the menu board) to the back wall where the Ice Tea station is.    #2 - Put the tea station on that white table below the chalk board for self-serve. Other than holding some vases it serves no purpose (unless its a bus station which would be yucky out front). Guests expect refills with ice tea. Charge me another 50 cents I can handle that.   #3 If what I had was exemplary take the food from good to exceptional with more seasoning.   Good luck Chop Shop! Hope youre a Scottsdale staple soon.',4
'I came in to see the Deer Tracks play here on a Thursday. It was pretty empty with a few regulars hanging about but Im sure this place has a decent crowd depending on who is there and the day of the week. The bartender was great - very friendly - and they have good prices on drinks. The sound isnt the best but its a nice place to see some awesome music. The crowd was definitely in their early-mid-20s so I certainly felt like an old fart being the ripe age of 30. :)  I would go back here no questions.',4
'Why why WHY has no one told me about this place! This place is EXACTLY what I want when I go out to breakfast!  The location: Totally tucked into that strip mall at 4oth & Greenway where most people (including me) never get past Starbucks and The Gelato Spot. Small inside but feels cozy.   The service: Awesome- nice ladies who fill up your coffee are sweet to your kid and know that what they do is based on immediately making you feel comfortable. On a related note for those of you with kids- There is NOTHING I appreciate more at a restaurant than a server who 1) gets your kids food out as soon as possible. Eating kid = happy kid and 2) hands YOU the hot plate so you can take care of it rather than dropping the plate in front of your 2 year old announcing its hot and leaving. DUH!  The food: Fantastic- I had the chicken and veggie skillet. I never order skillets because they are always greasy and loaded with cheese. I took a risk and it paid off! Perfect combo of yummy but  not I need to purge after this!  The price: Just right a LOT of food for not  a lot of money. Me the wife and our full size 2 year old ate for under $25. And lets just say I took food home- NEVER happens :)  The customers: Totally cool- the place is full of regulars who were all nice to our little one. It didnt hurt that he went table to table saying goodbye on our way out but nothing makes me want to smash a face as much as a person who is rude to my kid so mad props to the regs!  All in all this place  is just my speed and we will be back... A LOT!',5
'Real Japanese cuisine   For all those that think Teppan style is authentic Japanese food I hope my yelp opens your eyes.  Dont get me wrong I love to eat with a group of friends at Kyoto.  But know that the Teppan style cooking is an authentic tourist trap created by a chain restaurant owner in Japan.    The Review  I like the Kyoto bowl for but a good Japanese food.  The chiefs create a great experience and atmosphere and the Sushi is pretty good.  I have eaten here a few times and have had a saki bomb here or there. I learned the hard way how power full the drinks are so use with caution.',3
'Stayed two nights on business trip and was pleasantly surprised.  Best Western down the road was my first choice but it was full.  I read the first review for Yucca Motel mentioning the cleanliness and that is important to me so I tried it out.  Best Western was charging $90 and Yucca was only charging $55 so I was a little skeptical.  However all was well.  Room (112) was very very clean and neat.  Looked like some remodeling went on not too long ago.  Fresh paint and new tiles on the bathroom walls and floor.  Also new bathroom fixtures (sink toilet soap holders etc.)  Tiles on shower floor were older but were clean and in good repair.  The place was being temporarily manned by a very friendly and pleasant older couple while the owner was out-of-town on business as the older lady mentioned to me.  Free high-speed Wi-Fi mini fridge/freezer microwave desk and fairly large flat-screen TV.  A/C unit was tiny (size of those kind typically mounted in windows) but surprisingly it did the job.  Was kind of loud and had to run continuously during the day but kept the room at a pleasant temperature and thats saying something considering it reached 113 both days I was here!  Only complaint was that the drain plug was missing from the sink so ended up using the ice bucket for applying/rinsing my contact lenses.  BTW there is no ice machine that you can walk up to but if you go to the front office they will fill your ice bucket for you.  No restaurant/lobby here but I just drove the half-block to Best Western for breakfast so no big deal.  I would stay here again if Im ever in town again.  Met my needs and saved $35/night compared to Best Western down the road.  Update (6-12-13):  Spoke with the owner and complimented him on his motel and mentioned the missing drain plug.  He handed me a replacement one on the spot and mentioned that he is having some rooms measured for new carpet.',4
'I usually eat at the Thai Basil on Rural Rd just north of Main in Tempe for lunch.  My wife who is gluten soy dairy and sugar intolerant and I went to this location for dinner.  (As you can imagine it is difficult to find places where my wife may eat.)  We ordered my favorite Red Curry Chicken and tried the beef Red Curry.    Maybe because I have only ate lunch at the Tempe location but the servings were much different here.  At Tempe you get a small bowl of soup a spring roll and about half the amount of Curry and rice.  For dinner here I was disappointed that it didnt include the delicious spring rolls but the portions were huge!  My wife and I could have shared a single Curry and just ordered extra rice.  It comes in a large urn.  As usual it was some of the best Curry I have eaten.  (I love Curry.)    My wifes beef curry was medium and was a little bland for me but she thought my spicy was too hot.  (Here they have a rating for the heat from 1 - 5.  In Tempe they simply ask if you want it mild medium or hot.  This location has extra hot and super hot.  I just tried hot.)  We will definitely be going back again despite we live 10 miles away and there are two closer locations.  Best of all my wife could eat it.  However it turned out to be too sweet.  I think they sweeten the coconut milk they use.  So we will have to ask about this next time.  By the way the service was great.',4
'The food is freshly prepared and far lighter and more flavorful than any fast food place.  The service is pleasant and efficient at close to fast food prices.    The mahi mahi is so flavorful and I love the grilled fish burrittos especially Baja style - some of the best Ive ever had!  The fish tacos are also excellent any way you get them (Ive tried many different versions always great).',4
'why is this place so far away??  we ordered a burger the grilled chicken sandwich fries and onion rings. we topped it off w a fresh strawberry shake since it was the special for the day.   we split everything and boy oh boy was it great! I have also heard that their pizza is awesome and their breakfast. I need to go back and get both.  also dont forget to check out the bathroom. i think i spent like 15 minutes in there. lol jk. it is pretty entertaining though.',4
'I enjoy shopping consignment stores for the deeply instilled (by my mother) need to find - and brag - about getting the absolute best deals imaginable. More importantly I never seem to want to dress to the current fashion trends and regular retail locations never seem to fit my style. Both of these things are perfectly fulfilled by My Sisters Closet.  They have a huge variety of designer clothing shoes bags sunglasses coats and all sorts of attire. Compared to other locations this one definitely has a more high end feel better selection and is very spacious.  Ive found everything from amazing jeans to a coach handbag to a gorgeous dress for my work Christmas party. They have a ton to offer and I definitely recommend checking it out for the designer quality at the discount price.',5
'I feel bad cause I know this is a local owned business its close to me and I believe has been here since I moved here in 94. Used to be the only store and I never had a problem with it. The employees are great!  Not sure if more selection has raised my awareness or if this place has just degraded in what it offers.  Prices vary - all the markets play their games price this low to get people in mark other things up to make the profit. But the selection of fresh produce is lacking and the meat is really mediocre. I have shopped AJs and it appears Eddie Basha is sending all the good stuff there and placing the leftovers here. Never a great selection overpriced and I have been really disappointed with the beef Ive gotten here.  Hope they can stay in business but I actually drive a bit out of my way to hit the Frys as they have a better selection of produce and meat. Not great but better for sure. I go here now only if Im in dire need of some staple item and am too lazy to drive the extra few miles.',2
'I really like the ambiance of this restaurant with the indoor outdoor bar and the rotating brisket in the outside window display which motivates you to eat before you even get in the front door. Beef Short Ribs where delicious my wife and I had a couple great salads and the Sangria? Our tab was over $100.00 with tip so its definately not cheap but still very nice. A great place to take your lovely lady for a really nice lunch or dinner but be prepared for a crowd.',4
'This place is hidden in the Esplanade.  I never knew it existed until my Manager mentioned it for our team lunch.  I am always across the street for lunch or dinners.  And boy I have been missing out!!!   I love the super contemporary and casual feel to the place.  The music made me feel like I was in a nightclub (good tunes and mixes) but it does not suit everyone in our party.  Oh well!    We were greeted immediately and sat upstairs.  The place only had about 6 tables total during the lunch rush (not too good).  The served free homemade chips and salsa.  The chips are warm fresh and super super crisp.  I love them.  I didnt even need salsa for the chips.  They are AWESOME!  The best chips I have ever had.  Yes EVER!    I love the simple menu.  I opted out for the one of the specials quesadilla with chicken street meat and cheese.  The tortilla was just very good not just like a regular flour store brought kind this sucka was fresh.  The chicken street meat was the BOMB (slow roasted and braised with garlic clove rosemary and citrus juices).  OMG PARTY in my mouth!  The rest of the party ordered the signature tacos and came with arroz gonulas and Cuban black beans.  The arroz gondulas and Cuban black beans looked so good.  Next time!  I am worried about the traffic this place gets it is was not happen during lunch.  And I am sure it is pretty quite at nights.  Hang in there I love your food.',5
'I was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant is in scottsdale but in a slightly seedy area. But inside Lao has a nice ambiance. The service was good. Try the pumpkin curry!!!! One of the best curries I have had in my life. Order it spicy!!!!',5
'Very eligant mexican resturant across from fountain park. alittle on the pricey side though i would say that it is worth the extra cash for the great service your meal comes with.  5/5',5
'Chase Field (Bank One Ballpark) is a nice place. I dont go to a lot of games I do when I get free tickets or the Dodgers are in town...Go Blue! It has everyting that one needs in a ballpark. I like the fact that the roof can open and close. Stop and get the Peanut/Water Special outside the park...it is a good deal. All the seats seem to be good seats and getting in and out of downtown is not a problem. Enjoy!',4
'For being the biggest butterfly exhibit in the US it is not that big... I had a great time nonetheless :) once you walk in you watch an informative 3D movie about the monarch butterfly. Afterwards you see the butterfly chrysalis and some moth cocoon displays. Awesome! The best part is once you pass this and walk into a room where they explain the rules about the exhibit. NO TOUCHING BUTTERFLIES!! :(((( blah! Thats ok because they are allowed to touch you! :) Once you spend an ungodly amount of time chasing butterflies and begging them to land on you back in the building you go to enjoy some desert bugs and aquariums.',4
'I gave 3 stars based on the fact that I havent actually eaten here yet. I went for the shaved iced (which was amazing) and ended up talking to the owner for a while. He plied me with talk of sweet Hawaiian bread and dogs that are actually grilled instead of boiled. Really looking forward to eating there. But in the mean time if you have a sweet tooth you should definitely check it out',3
'I have gone to this Applebees countless times and each time the food has been okay and the waiters have been mediocre. I liked the food that they have but for the past 3 times that I have gone. My food took ONE HOUR AND A HALF. That was unacceptable to me! They also didnt give a discount or even sorry for the inconvience. I remember seeing a commerical of how the food needs to be made in 30 minutes during happy hour or it all will be free. I guess that doesnt apply! Its probably another scam to bring customers in. I also didnt give the waitresses a tip each on of the times that the food was late. My friends and I were about to leave because the food took so long to come. I had ordered a simple spicy chicken salad and that took almost 2 hours to prepare. Other peoples foods were being made before us when they had clearly come later then us. Probably not going to this place anymore more for late night food.',1
'Delicious sandwiches!  Ive been here a few times and have had the meatball and cheesesteak sandwiches. Amazing!  The cheese they use on the cheesesteak really makes it.  Also have had the antipasto salad and it is huge!  Wife and I had to take the extra home for leftovers.  Only drawback is seating is very limited. Theres an outside area so that probably helps when it gets a little nicer out. Id try off peak hours.',5
'Beautiful decor!  Excellent food with fast and friendly service!',5
'My elderly mother used to take her 1987 Mercedes to Arts. And now I take the car to Arts too. Art and his staff are wonderful. They are honest reliable forthright and they do great work. They explain everything and it is clear to me that Art has kept repairs and repair prices down i.e. a less honest person could easily have thrown in extra repairs. I have suggested repairs to him where he has told me no you dont want to do that or no you really dont need to do that and so forth. --You see my point. You will be happy if you take your cars here.',5
'Pretty good but very standard. Everything tastes nice but its not spectacular. I was very impressed with the service though. I was out with some friends and my friends young daughter - the moment we were seated the waiter brought over some dough for the daughter to play with in order to keep her entertained. Props for that!',3
'Love this place food was amazing!! Cost in my opinion is really good for the great service and food I received. Highly suggest this place',5
'Ordered from NYPD Pizza a few time here in our office. We are about 2 blocks away. It takes them over an hour to get us our pizza. They also charge a deliver fee which is fine but dont expect a huge tip when it takes over and hour to get our overpriced pizza. Well the driver wasnt too fond that we tipped him a few bucks on top of the delivery fee and stormed out of our office cussing and making a seen and drove off in a fit of rage. This is the second time this has happened from this same delivery guy. We called in to talk to the manager and he was nothing but rude and did nothing about the situation. We will not be ordering pizza from this place ever again!',1
'I wrote a big scathing story but decided just to put it simply.  Their water is cold. Go somewhere else if you need/want warm water to rinse your car or undercarriage.',2
'Its hard to find a rewarding donut in this city  and by rewarding I mean  that taste that brings back all the memories I associate with donuts.  As a child growing up in Orange County Ca. we had not only Winchells donuts but Mom and  Pop joints that  were usually ran by a sweet Asian family who knew how to make a great donut. Youd find them on almost every corner. From my earliest donut memories of stopping for donuts on the way to church or mom buying donuts for birthday party   or later when donuts provided me comfort during my parents divorce to the fun of buying a dozen donuts on the way home from a wild college night  donuts have  been there for me  like my own sacred rite of passage thru my life.  Okay that might be stretching it a bit.. but donuts are chocked with memories for me .  So the anticipation was high as I decided on my sick day to stop for a comforting donut or two at Lamars. When I walked in I hoped that somehow a little ole lady would come out from behind the counter but no instead I ordered from the local chain  .  The first donut was an old fashioned  it tasted like it was right off of  memory lane  sweet but not sickening great dough  lightly iced. I was taken back to every yummy donut I ever adored... Great!  I made my second  donut an old favorite  pink iced cake donut ..here is where it all went horribly wrong .. the donut tasted dry over cookedwith a gaggy sweet non distinguishable icing...the horror...  Well if you love donuts go to La mars maybe it was an off day for the frosted pink donut..and make sure to have a old fashioned donut for me..',3
'I rather like the food here. They have a pretty standard bar menu but its executed well for a hotel lobby bar. They keep good hours and are always open late. Prices are high but one should expect so being the location as most hotel bars are pricey. A lot of people always say oh the hotels just like to gouge people... thats not it most hotel charges are on expense accounts and people dont care what stuff costs so the prices reflect that. Just dont try using that revolving door after 10PM or you will look a fool.',3
'Solid option by the airport. I wouldnt stay anywhere else.',4
'Weve been going here since it opened so were definitely fans. The food is good service is fast and prices are reasonable. Their chile relleno is one of the best in town and their lunch specials are super cheap.',4
'We saw this place walking one night from Breadfruit to The Roosevelt.  Based on the reviews here we didnt know what to expect.  Even the hostess was surprised when we told her we read the Yelp reviews before our visit.    What a fun place!  We went about 6pm on weekday and there was plenty of happy hour left for us.  And great prices too.  We had a Volcano & Vegas rolls which we really liked.  Then we tried the edamame shui mai.  If you go please try these as you wont be disappointed.  The dipping sauce was sesame / mango.  We also had the Orange Blossom Sun Kiss and 22oz Asahi bomber.  No way can you beat the happy hour prices for this sushi.  We enjoyed our table.  The metal chairs reminded me of the long forgotten Miracle Mile Deli.  Great energy in this place.  Cant wait to visit to try more of the menu.',4
'Love this spot for a good lunch! Great salads and fresh sandwhiches !! Its my daily lunch! im in love! keep it up!!',5
'Very tasty vegetarian food.  I wouldnt say everything is healthy but its definitely the best vegetarian food Ive ever had.',5
'I couldnt agree more about wanting to give this place more stars!   My husband and I (just recently vegetarians) met a good friend (a life-time vegetarian) at Green for dinner last night and WOW were we impressed!  There was a constant flow of customers in and out in the 2 hours were sat ate and talked. You order at the counter and your food is brought to you; the line moved fast and the food was fast to come out of the kitchen piping hot  We started with the buffalo wings - the sauce was super flavorful and the dipping sauce was sooo good we ordered more to go with our meals  I had the Wendy Pickle - closest vegetarian Chik-Fil-A sandwich ever! It was so flavorful and the fries that came with it were great!  My husband had the Big Wac - vegetarian version of the Big Mac - he said it was amazing!  To finish it off we had the Dough Boy for dessert - YUM YUM YUM!!!  We cannot wait to go back :)',5
'Another one of the fabulous culinary masterpieces of Fox Restaurants. Went here for dinner on a Thursday night with the BF. The 25 minute wait for a table was well worth it even though we had scoped out the neighboring competition. The concept is inspiring and the food options excite my taste buds. I am willing to pay a little extra for healthy sustainable foods- its the San Fran in me.  We started with the sashimi tuna salad. Loaded with fresh veggies generous amount of tuna mixed with a light and zesty ginger dressing.   Our main dish was the spaghetti squash casserole which they split for us half with chicken and half without for me the quasi-sporadic vegetarian.  For dessert the flourless chocolate cake was delightful. Although I should have ordered my own to avoid the vulture-like antics as we both inhaled every scrumptious morsel. My learned sophistication reminded me that licking the plate is unacceptable.   Bottom-line: I would come back for the atmosphere service and ostensible bio-dynamic food!',4
'I love the use of lemon zest to lighten up a pizza especially as the weather gets warmer.  There was a light sprinkle of it on my clam pie even though it was not mentioned in the menu and it was also on the shrimp pie as well as the olive oil gelato in a candied version.    The clam pie was a little disappointing - I was hoping for something like the ones Ive tasted in NYC.  Clams are such subtle things that more needs to be used and I would not mind paying a few more dollars for that.  Our disappointment was quickly redeemed by the wonderfully refreshing and  balanced flavor of the shrimp pie.  The combination of perfectly cooked crunchy shrimp basil chili flakes and lemon zest set off fireworks on every part of my palate.  Its something I would definitely go back for.    The pizza crust has a great contrast of crunch as well as chewiness which reminds me of the crust at Mozza in LA but it does not have the complexity in flavor of Chris Biancos.  Biancos probably uses a starter dough that has developed that amazing flavor due to over a decade of use.  Thats tough to beat.  The olive oil gelato has a nice creaminess to it but tasted more like sweet cream base with a hint of lemon than olive oil.  My only problem with it was my expectation to taste olive oil but now that I know its more about the texture I think I like it more.',4
'The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world.',4
'Great pizza and they deliver. Try the monster!',4
'I went early to try their Happy Hour special before meeting up with friends for a birthday dinner.   The bar area was very spacious.  HH specials are from 3PM - 7PM daily; reverse from 9PM -closing.   Heres what I had:  Sangria was small and very weak ($ 4.00).  Zucchini Parmesan wasnt bad but oily ($4.00).   Stuffed mushrooms had better ($6.00) HH Roasted Chicken Pizza was delicious and definitely worth the $6.00 Must try!  We later seated in a gorgeous banquet room.  The staffs provided excellent service. I have shared with my Sis the linguine and clams unfortunately I hate to say it but Olive Gardens tasted better.  The Tiramisu certainly made up for lack of flavor in the linguine and clams dish.',3
'Thanks to Shannon & Randi for their help! I had a very positive experience thorough and fast to respond within my demanding timeframe.',5
'I love this place.  I absolutely love it.  Great food great drinks Really cool vibe.  I am an AZ native and love eating down town.  This is the first place I think of when trying to come up with something fun and delicious that everyone will enjoy.  Be prepared for some good spicy Caribbean food',4
'What an interesting concept.  Sushi was B+ A- Atmosphere A Service A+',4
'All my best finds come from this store.  If you pop in frequently youll find they get some really great stuff.  There are cool clothes sometimes I even find Threadless and Shirt.woot T-shirts here.  Ive found great dresses for $10.  Its a a rare thrift store where you can find clothes for non-obese or retired women but hey - I get all my work clothes here. Furniture is hit or miss but isnt it always?  My one gripe: they charge almost twice as much for womens shirts as they do for mens.  Even if its just a t-shirt one that would pop up in mens or in childrens depending on the judgement of the employee if its in womens its $4.99 if its in mens its $2.99.  I understand charging more for shirts with ruffles and buttons and weird cuts that probably cost more to begin with but t-shirts should all cost the same.  I dont like having an employee not believe me that the Jim Morrison t-shirt that I got off the mens rack is really a womens shirt that should cost me an extra $2.',4
'Had a terrible experience here.  Stopped in for a quick bite before take off and left more than a 40% tip because we couldnt wait for change.  After finding out our flight was delayed for more than an hour we returned for a drink.  The same wait person Alison took our drink order for 2 margaritas without any questions.  It wasnt until our $30 bill arrived that we reLized we had been hood winked.  While there are different prices and sizes of margaritas Alison took it upon herself to deliver and charge us for the very most expensive one to order.  When we asked her why she said thats what we always do and walked away.  At that point she was eager to leave as it was the end of her shift and she wanted to go home.  She lingered for a tip.  We ddnt leave one.  Maybe one day shell figure out why.',1
'On the basis of other Yelp reviews I decided to check this place out. Very cute interior! It was crowded in the small place when we got there but we were able to snag a place at the bar. The coffee was indeed strong and tasty although we had to ask them for refills even though someone passed us often. The whole wheat pancakes were delicious and the bacon was thick and cooked just right. The lunch menu looks great so Ill be back to try that theyre also open for limited dinner now as well.',4
'Hands down the best wings in Arizona. The place gets pretty packed during high profile sporting games so its a fun environment for people who love the energy.  Im a huge fan of the boneless wings. BBQ Hot and the Caribbean Jerk are my personal faves but with over 15 types of sauces to choose from you be the judge',5
'The hubby & I have been visiting Phoenix for about a week. We were here on Easter. Normally we would be at my grandmas for dinner which would consist of fried chicken greens ham mac & cheese and whatever dessert my ma decides to make. I usually eat light and avoid fried food but I kinda missed that traditional Easter dinner. Karims was closed Sunday but thank goodness they were open Monday.  Catfish was perfectly seasoned and crispy. Delicious!  The potato salad was a little sweet not what Im used to. The peach cobbler was fantastic.   I think were going back there for lunch today. Hopefully they have greens today they didnt yesterday.  Their hours are tricky so call ahead or check their website before you go.',4
'So Ive never had Vietnamese Pho before (pronounced fu as in fun without the n) and I decided to try it with a friend of mine who speaks Vietnamese and would be able to tell me what to order and what I was eating and also steer me to the best place in town so Id have a positive initial Pho experience and want to go back again and again.  unPHOgettable is tucked into an Asian cultural center just south of Main Street on Dobson on the west side of the road and is part of the Asian grocery story but has its own entrance and eating area. It had a pretty nice atmosphere the owner was very helpful and even recognized my friend and his wife as we walked in (I figured they either eat there quite a bit or the owner remembers him because he doesnt likely see very many tall geeky white kids who speak Vietnamese). The menu had a very wide selection and did a decent job of explaining what each of the items are. The owner offered to go over the menu with us since it was our first time but my friend told him that he would handle it. The place was pretty clean and the staff was very helpful. My only minor complaint was that there was a minor fish odor in the air but I wasnt quite sure if it was the restaurants fish or the adjoining Asian grocery store that had the fishy smell. Either way it wasnt overpowering and didnt detract from our meal at all.  I ordered Pho with thin sliced beef and tendon. I have to admit that when I looked at the menu I thought tendon was tenderloin so I assumed I was ordering thin strips of beef with beef junks. It wasnt until my friends wife repeated my order with an emphasis on TENDON that I realized what I ordered. Either way though Im pretty adventurous so I figured Id give it a shot. My wife ordered a flat noodle meal instead of the soup since shes had it before. The food didnt take long and we were brought our enormous bowls of Pho with all the trimmings. I added a decent amount of hoisen sauce and an even more decent amount of hot sauce. The broth in my bowl actually ended up pretty dark red. I added in my bean sprouts tore up my basil and plopped in my jalapeños to boot. I dug in and was amazed at how great it tasted. I wasnt really amazed that it tasted good but that it tasted SO good AND Id never had it before. Why had people kept this a secret from me? It was fantastic and right up my alley. Soup hot sauce and noodles. I wolfed mine down and even tried my wifes noodle dish not really enough to give a thorough review but it was good and Id try it again.  The prices werent bad I ended up paying about $22 for the two of us to eat our meals and a small appetizer split between 4 people. Range: $7.50 - $12.00.  Sorry for posting without pictures but Im sure Ill be back and append some pics to this after my next bowl.  Because of this place I am now a fan of Vietnamese food specifically the Pho soup.

'Coolest coffee shop Ive been to in Phoenix so far! Definitely not your average coffee shop! They have an extensive menu with lots of fresh and local products they cool with. The menu changes daily too which is so much fun. This place is close to school so I can see myself spending lots if days studying on their comfy couches. Their long wooden dining table was perfect for us nursing students to spread out million books out on! My iced skinny caramel latte tasted like it was full of cals and goodness! The coffee beans they use are sooo much more tasty than Starbucks! Theres also a bar on one side. We saw oranges being squeezed into champagne and the drink menu was something special! Will have to test it out in a day I dont have my nose in my books! Brain has to rest right?! This is one of those hard to describe places so you must indulge for yourself! Most definitely a place to try!',5
'Forgot the straw... but still five stars!  I was in Scottsdale for work and wanted to relax in my hotel room after a long day of meetings.  Not being from the area I googled delivery and Romes Pizza came up.  Friendly woman on the phone and from previous reviews she must be in the family of this self-owned and run business.  My bolognese and fettuccine came within the promised half hour and the food was fresh.  Delivery guy was nice and friendly.  Probably the most delicious delivery pasta Ive ever had.  Even the salad was fresh and I dont think it was prepackaged as many pizza places do.  Yes they forgot the straw for my drink but I definitely recommend... for both in- and out-of-towners!',5
'came here for dinner and a free show last Sunday. we unknowingly arrived in the middle of their trivia night. as far as trivia questions go - these were hard! I play bar trivia occasionally and I usually know at least a few answers. I dont think I knew a single question they asked here! and I thought it was weird that they ask ALL the questions and dont even tell you the answers until the very end. if I had been playing I wouldve gone crazy with frustration wanting to know what the correct answer was! it seems like the people participating were enjoying themselves though. I believe the prizes for winning trivia are a $25 gift certificate or two tickets to a show.  the food: nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either. I ordered the quesadilla to which I added steak. they shouldnt really call it steak because it was shredded beef. only other ingredient inside the quesadilla was a lot of cheese. it came with a side of chips and salsa and a huge scoop of sour cream. I might come here for food again but its nothing notably delicious.  the show: their stage/venue is really awesome with the seated bleachers in the back and standing room in the front. I love how intimate and small the stage is. we saw three local bands perform for free; they were all very different musically but I enjoyed them all. if a band I liked was playing I would definitely come back to catch them play!',4
'Delicious! The ceviche tostada and carne asada tacos are my favorite. Very clean environment the staff are always friendly. Anything you eat will be worth it.',5
'I have to admit I have a love-hate relationship with this place. I should try other wine bars that way I have an idea of what to compare Bomberos to. I have to say though the bruschetta and the many options they offer to top it have been quite tasty. I think thats about where my love stops. The past few times I have gone its on a Saturday night since they are open until 1 am. I have had the same waitress the 3 of 4 times I have gone and all I can say to describe her is rude. When I first checked the place out I was a bit confused with the menu and she stood there in that awkward silent way when you know someone is thinking youre an idiot. She wouldnt say a word until I asked for clarification. Even while clarifying she seemed so incredibly annoyed to be doing her job in talking to a customer. Once she was gone I didnt see a refill unless I flagged her down so I can get some ice water with a side of evil eye. The other thing I dont understand is why does bread with cold toppings take 25 minutes every time and hardly anyone around?',3
'Ive tried the green curry with chicken (twice) and with crispy tofu (once) and I must say that Im giving up on their version of this dish. The curry sauce is too watery for my taste and cmon now ten small pieces or less of green beans a smattering of bamboo shoots and coconut milk do not a delicious green curry make! Apparently a couple of my Thai coworkers agree that the curries at Yuphas leave much to be desired. Im told that Yupha serves excellent noodle dishes but Ill have to take their word since noodles do not rock my boat. Speaking of boats check out the cool green mural of a floating produce market at the new location. I really like the atmosphere here. Tis a shame that I must go elsewhere for fantastic green curry... I DO recommend the albeit not authentic Thai cuisine TASTY dish of soft-shelled crab with garlic sauce. This certainly rocked my world that one evening last week ;)  Ill be dining here with a group of chowhounders this week so I may be back with a review of non-curry based dishes. Stay tuned!  You MUST try the homemade coconut ice cream- we had ours served over sweet sticky rice and toasted grated coconut sprinkled on top.  It totally made up for the lackluster curry.',3
'Came here because we saw this place on Triple D and Guy goes to some delicious places... So I had to check it out. It was delicious! The customer service was on point! This friendly girl helped us out with ordering and also let us sample the six most popular items on the menu. Now that really helped me decide. I ordered the red jade chicken and carnitas combo with the pork fried rice and black beans. It was so good!!!  All of the combination of favors- Asian and mexican is one great combo. I order a quesadilla for my son and they accidentally made it with the wrong meat- the guy lets me choose a whole new order and.... It was on the house!!! So I had ordered the same combo but this time the red jade chicken in a quesadilla.... One of the best quesadillas Ive had! And Im from San Francisco where theyve got bomb ass Mexican food!!!  This place was great and with each order you get a free cookie. The place is in a tiny strip mall and its practical but very clean. Customer service was just as good as the food! When I come back to Phoenix Im def hittin this place up again!!',5
'I had never been to this stores location in Scottsdale before Saturday. I have frequented the Biltmore location (and Im a HUGE fan of their store & clothes). However I will NEVER go back to the Bogota location because of the service/staff. The only people in the store who were getting good service or help were the snotty sales girls friends. Not only were they unhelpful but the sales girl actually insulted me to my face (YOUre a size 2? - YES actually I am).....I walked out and went to the Biltmore location to spend several hundred dollars.   I am a big supporter of luluemons products and store....but avoid the Bogota location if you want any service or a good selection.',1
'Many a long high school night were spent here. Copying presentations gluing things onto inappropriately large pieces of posterboard those were the days!  Not really. But Kinkos really was always the most helpful and easiest place to take on projects like those. Staff could always decipher the copy machines which have since become the bain of the existence of every nine to fiver I know.   Copies are cheap and the service the staff provides is damn near invaluable. If it werent for them those miserable projects (does anyone remember diaramas?) would have been even worse.',4
'Dont go if you are looking for super-fresh and well-prepared sushi. If however you are looking for a happy hour spot with cheap good drinks in a chic environment where you can also get some discounted sushi Kabuki is the spot for you.   My husband and I were going to see the premiere of the Mamma Mia sing-along version at Harkins Tempe Marketplace and wanted to stop at a happy hour or two first. Thanks to previous Yelp reviews we found out that Kabuki has happy hour featuring drink and food specials so we decided to check it out. I loved the decor in the bar area - very sleek and modern with lots of cool vertical Sake bottle displays. Our drinks (on special for $4.95) were quite good - I had the Mint Drop which was refreshing but not too sweet and he had the Long Island which was nice and strong without being disgusting. For snacks we had the Spicy Tuna and Salmon Skin rolls (each $2.95) - both were fine but not much better than the stuff you can buy at grocery stores. Our server was friendly and efficient.   All in all we got two good drinks and some standard sushi for under $20 including tip. Not bad. Kabuki is definitely a cool spot for meeting some friends for happy hour but dont count on the sushi being anything to write home about.',3
'I searched Yelp for a place to have lunch in the Historic Glendale area today and decided on Farjardos Cafe after reading through some reviews.  We ordered a couple of the daily specials and I had the green chile soup also. Everything was very good and the service was fast and friendly.  Someone on another site mentioned they need to install a fryer and make fresh chips and I agree but the chips we were served were fresh and warm. Add the fresh home made salsa was really excellent so we were not disappointed.  All the food was excellent and I was really impressed. The green sauce was supurb and the flavor of the rice and beans was really beyond what I normally expect.  This place gets da two thumbs up from me!',5
'i liked  the food but after a hangover who wont eat anything! great place for hangover not have when sober. great place to people watch thats for sure!',2
'When I was planning my wedding last year I was also with child (like Sophie below) so I decided that I needed to find a great tailor that would take care of my dress quickly because I wasnt sure how much my growing midsection would change within a few weeks time.  I bought my dress 2 sizes too big because I wasnt sure how much fabric would be needed and took it to Valentina 2 weeks before the big day.  Not only did she take it in perfectly but she did it in only a few days and only charged me $30!!  Score one for the prego bride.  I would highly recommend her she was great fast and professional.',5
'Important lesson learned today.. Sometimes traffic can lead to good things? Leaving La Purisima Bakery and on my way to the Esplanade to pick up a few things. I needed to turn left but it was not going to happen anytime this century so right it was. Trying to find a place to turn around I spot this place out of the corner of my eye. I pull one of those jackass right turn from the middle lane moves and come hurdling into the parking lot.. Food emergency! I should have a siren or something.  Walked in the door and the first thing I notice is one of the display cases is filled with ritter sports bars... ALL OF THE RITTER SPORTS BARS! Most of these had to be imported as they are not available in the US. Some of them I had never even heard of. It also appeared they had most if not all of the Milka bars. Under that was a huge selection of Lindt choclate bars.  My eyes continued to wonder up the case as I notice.. oh cool they have the dark and light Niederegger Marzipan.. and OHHH MYYY GOD! is that what I think it is?? Niederegger Weissbrot Marzipan.. This is THE stuff. There are few things in this world that cannot be made better by adding chocolate and this is one of them. Niederegger makes some of the best marzipan and Ive always been upset that I can only find the chocolate covered stuff. It only takes away from their superior product. I am unaware of anyone else who carries the weirssbrot in the valley. You can order it online *sometimes* by the case and thats just not safe for me. This was turning out to be one of the best Saturdays ever ;) I would go into the differences between American/European marzipan but am trying to cut down on babble in my reviews.. like this.. *fail* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marzipan  I asked the nice lady at the counter if there was anything else that I should not go without she said sadly they had sold out of most of what they made that day but that they had some fresh coconut macaroons. Again.. I thought maybe I had died crossing traffic like that and ended up in my own personal happy place. Although far from a regional specialty of the bakeries decent I had to get one. It was flat which was very strange and half of it had been dipped into dark chocolate. All I knew was that I was glad there were 4+ people coming to dinner to help me eat all of this stuff or I WOULD eat it all by myself and get sick.  If nothing else make a trip here to treat yourself to some chocolate you wont find anywhere else. Everything else is just a bonus :)',4
'I brought a prescription in from another doctor. They have a wide selection of designer frames (and cheaper frames that would be mostly covered by my insurance). But I ended up with some Oliver Peoples frames. The entire staff was very friendly and patient. They took their time and went through all the different type of lens options that I could add on my glasses. Im happy with my glasses and I recommend this place!',5
'Very good food.  Incredible kid meals...  Finally a place that offers kids a real meal.    Seems to be busier during the week and a little slow on weekends so easier to get a table on Saturdays!',4
'Havng been to other Michael Mina establishments (lame Clock Bar in San Francisco) my husband and I decided to try Bourbon Steak in Scottsdale (at the Fairmont Hotel). What a difference a city makes is all I will say! THis place had incredible management an amazing staff and outstanding food. The best steak house I have EVER been to all around. Heres to hoping their reputation in my books keeps their stamina from our last vsit!',5
'Went to this location today to meet friends because it was the closest to the middle of our houses.... thanks Good Egg for totally ignoring the SW Valley :/  I drove here not expecting much (always known this location as the crappy one) I had been to this location while it was still under the forgotten step-child The Eggery.  I was surprised that they had finally gotten rid of that name and changed the signage to The Good Egg (not sure if this is recent or not I havent been down this part of Camelback in a bit of time).  Upon seeing the new signage I thought perhaps there would be a better experience to be had.... no nope not at all.  I met my party that was already seated in the WAAAAAAY outdated restaurant... I mean seriously people the bakery cases that havent been used in decades the wood the wallpaper the metal chairs and all the BRASS... oh my goodness all the brass....YUCK!..... Give this place a little attention Good Egg.  When I sat down I found half of the table wet and no napkins a little puzzled I asked what the deal was.  Apparently the waiter had spilled the water all over the table and used our napkins to try and wipe it up.... I repeat TRY to clean it up he didnt succeed. Perhaps if he had went to get a towel he could of gotten all the water up but apparently he never did (as this happened 10 min. before I got there and there was still puddles all over the table.  Nor did he come back with fresh napkins...nice buddy nice.  After being there for about 5 minutes the guy came to ask if I wanted anything to drink... Coffee and cream please. And walks away before we can say that we are ready to order... Now I am the ding dong who was a half hour late because my ass slept in so friends were huunnngggry.....He comes back with coffee (lukewarm at best) no cream and walks away...AGAIN.  We sit and sit and sit.  He finally comes and ask if we are ready to order umm.. we had been there 45 minutes and 15 minutes...yeah I think weve got it.   We order and remind him again of the cream and napkins.  He comes back with cream no napkins.  sigh.  Food finally comes order is right but haphazardly prepared.  Maybe the kitchen guy overslept too?    I have the Monterrey it is missing tomatoes and you can tell that it was almost forgotten about because the eggs were starting to brown my english muffin is nearly burnt and looks like it was toasted on a grill that needs some scrubbing the cook compensated by soaking it in butter. Dollar Pancakes were shaped like road kill and the side plate they came on was placed on my main plate.  Thats no big deal I dont care.  But as I am going fork to plate the server takes the side plate off the main plate...umm...eew dont touch my food once it has hit the table.  I worked my way through high school and college waiting tables I have a high tolerance for eew but some things just bug me right away... this is one of them.  Dude if you touch my food while it is in the kitchen ignorance is bliss but if you do it in front of me once the food is ON THE TABLE for goodness sake then that shit just be NASTY yo!  I know damn well there is a good chance your hands arent clean.  Practically no food workers wash their hands as much as they are supposed to unless the health inspector is there....sorry people its true.  Friend 1 had an even more crispy looking omelet.  Friend 2 got a turkey sandwich.  It was dry and lacking in well... turkey! It looked as if they had folded up one piece of lunch meat to make it look more substantial.  Her salad was pretty lame looking and had the runniest ranch dressing I had ever seen.  What was even worse is that there was one sad runaway strawberry in her sandwich... wtf? Check your cold storage bins people!  If Friend 1 had been the one to order the sandwich instead of Friend 2 then I wouldnt be writing this review right now because I would be supporting Friend 1 in the HOSPITAL!! Friend 1 has a major strawberry allergy.  i understand shit happens but how does a STRAWBERRY get put on a TURKEY sandwich and the cook doesnt notice?!??!!!  We could of said something if our server wasnt practicing his disappearing act again. Only time we saw him after he dropped off the food was when he dropped the check and kindly paused out of his busy day to say Everything ok? ...kind of waited for a response and walked away.. no thank you have a good day come again bugger off nothing....  Mind you I use the word busy lightly there was about 6 tables in the whole place full at 10am and at least 4 other servers that I saw.   This was the third time I had been to this location... shitty experience as always you know what that means people.... three strikes youre out! (oh and the water pitcher that half of which was spilled all over...the water was unfiltered grossness...boo :/ )',1
'Great happy hour spot which FYI is Monday - Friday 4pm-7pm. Draft beers are $3 and you can get specialty drinks for 5 and 6 bucks a pop. I decided to try the Strawberry Basil Martini and was in love. My friend got a plain mojito but was just as happy with her drink as I was. We split the red pepper hummus platter which has super delicious chips served with it and the chicken quesadilla. We also both got a side garden salad that was pretty small but only $3.99 and it came with a piece of cheese toast. The food in general was good nothing fantastic but the prices and atmosphere is what will be bringing me and friend back again. The layout is open with three different bars and several tables inbetween them. There was a giant stage behind the main bar but no one was playing when we were there. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick. Looking forward to going back for happy hour again.',4
'Great ceviche friendly staff and good service.  The only downside is the continuous construction on Mesa Drive makes getting in and out of the plaza a pain otherwise Id visit more.',4
'It is a fun place to take kids but can be distracting for adults.  There are times when the animals move rain comes down in one area as lightning flashes.  We had good service and the food portions were big.  The food was fine.    There are aquariums to look at while waiting for a meal.  Its a bit pricey for just a meal though not outrageous but if you want entertainment for the kids the price isnt that bad.',3

Sure its primarily a college crowd and I am a few years out but hey nothing wrong with sluggin back some brewskies with the kiddies right?  Well maybe but in this case no. Most Tempe/Scottsdale bars tend to be meat markets of steroid users and plastic surgery victims but not Caseys. It promotes a very chill vibe and a laid back atmosphere which is what I for one look for when Im having some drinks. Chances are if Im out I had a long day or week and I want to unwind a bit.   There is no better place around to do that than Caseys.',5
'This review is for the 3-5p happy hour:  Ehhhhhh.....  Maybe Im a sushi snob but what I do know is that deep-fried does not equal sushi. There were 6 sushi rolls to choose from their happy hour menu ALL of which consisted of deep-fried shiet. I dont get it? The sushi chefs are Japanese they should be legit. The crunch roll was absolutely miniscule the spicy tempura tuna roll and the tempura shrimp roll both had the same sugary mayo sauce squirted all over them the green tea ice cream was covered in chocolate sauce!   Disappointed after all these great Yelp reviews. Come to the happy hour if you want to get drunk. The rolls arent even that cheap for what you get. Meh.',2
'Awesome experience great price delivery the same day!!! This Sunday my husband and I went to J&K to see if we could find a dining room set (table and 6 chairs) that would accommodate our needs. After a while in this warehouse we found a set we loved and we calculated it was priced 75% off of a regular furniture store we just had to buy it. Then we were told the buffet behind it  was included now this set was 90% off - better yet they delivered the same day. I could not be happier....',5
'First thing I have to say is believe all the other reviews when they talk about the amount of food you will get here!  The second thing I have to say is that everything is average.  Crazy Ottos excels with service as it is extremely quick attentive and efficient.  We were able to have breakfast in under 30 minutes.  Thats a good thing for me.  The food however is just average at above average prices.  I got bacon eggs toast and hashbrowns for my meal.  I was served a massive platter of food that I knew I wouldnt finish.  The bacon was okay but unfortunately some parts of it were burnt.  The eggs (scrambled) were actually really good!  They were light and fluffy and very tasty.  The hashbrowns were no good.  I never get good hashbrowns unless I am at Matts.  I was pleasantly surprised that nothing felt very greasy.  I probably wont go back because there about a million other places just like it and I would rather go somewhere new.',3
'This place is awesome.  Its at a great location and easy to get to.  From the moment we walk in we are greeted with a smile and a great attitude.  Weve been here twice and each time has been great.  They serve thin crust pizza.  Try the Capicola.  They also brew their own beer plus they offer guest taps which they change up ever so often.  Everyone is friendly and we love this place.',5
'Every time I need help with a a project everyone in the store is very helpful. Great Fabrics and supplies too.',5
'Great for everyday reading studying kid books. starbucks inside if youre that type. just like any other B&N. employees are hard to find sometimes they take a long time just to find a book or even make it to the register. restrooms are dirty. doesnt seem like they are maintained regularly. i mostly come here to buy my son books. they have  nice section for kids. also have a train set they can play with if you wanna play with them or just sit back and have some time for yourself. kids section is probably the best in this store. i uploaded a picture of the entrance of it.',3
'Ive eaten from here twice and everything was ok. Ordered and paid online and the food came pretty quickly. But TODAY there was a hair in my pizza that was UNDER the cheese. We got our money back and ate somewhere else. Again this could have just been a fluke since Ive had no problems before but it seriously grossed me out.',1
'Loved it!  After reading the review above was skeptical yet YELP had many positive reviews.  My wife and I celebrated our 21st Anniversary and could not have been happier with the experience.  We had the Persian Platter (sampler) for the appetizer Chefs special (sampler - chicken/fish) and some cold Taj Mahal beer (two to be exact).   We made reservations yet showed up 30 minutes early and was seated with no issues.  We went on a Thursday night for reference.   Service was great and waiter explained the Persian food as we were clueless and only hungry.  Two rice dishes were fabulous.  We will go back again with friends and family.  Total bill was $72.  We had allot of leftovers to take home and enjoyed the next few days.',4
'Considering the lack of dive bars left in downtown Phoenix the Bikini gets 5 stars otherwise it would get 4.  We started going there about 6 years ago when we lived in the FQ Story district.  We love dive bars and the best time to go is during the week or on a Sunday afternoon if you really want to get a feel for the typical clientele.  I love the wackiness of this place and believe it or not they have cleaned up the place a bit.  This was the very first bar that anyone ever bought us a drink for no reason.  The owner was hanging out with her CSI buddies and her boyfriend brought us over two beers.  In Buffalo regulars and bartenders often buy drinks for other clientele but we had not yet experienced this in Phoenix.  This man renewed our faith in bar etiquette.  More recently we spent NYE here and even though I was the designated driver I had a great time.  We walked in and before my cohort could decide what they wanted to drink we noticed that a gentleman had left his dentures in his hat on the bar while he was about 10 feet away playing video crack.  Where else does this happen but the Bikini?  Later my husband was outside smoking and some guy with no shoes came up to him to ask Are you down for whatever?  Again where else would this happen?  And we managed to entertain ourselves throughout the night by sending boys into the restroom to purchase postage stamp sized porn from the porn and wierd condom machine. Hilarious.  Then the bar owner started handing out fringed squakers hats and noise makers at about 11 which meant that for an hour people were making tons of noise.  I had a blast.',5
'Aside from the normal hum drum mexican food you can get just about anywhere else the decor was quite different and the outside seating was rather impressive. It definitely was not your average Mexican restaurant.   The service on the other hand was atrocious. We had to walk all the way through the outside seating and into the main building of the restaurant in order to see a hostess who in turn told us to sit where ever. Wouldnt it have been easier if the hostess stand was by the entrance then? After we sat down we were immediately ushered to order by a flushed faced server. You could tell they were understaffed.   We munched on chips and salsa for about 20 minutes before our food came to the table. Mind you we got a chimichanga meal and something with chicken. It shouldnt have taken 20 minutes. The worst part I would have to say is that during the entire time we were eating there were girls dressed in skimpy costumes parading in and out of the restaurant. My jaw and about 50 others were dropped every time one of those girls walked past.   After getting fed up with the lowsy service mediocre food and jaw dropping atmosphere we decided to leave. However we waited 30 minutes in order to pay our bill.   Word to the wise: Stay away',1
'This place is delicious. I have been twice with my girlfriend and will defiantly be back. The service is consistently good. The food is made with high quality ingredients and cooked in a wood burning oven. They also have a unique beer selection! It can be tough to find though. It is tucked in the back corner of a shopping center. They do have a small patio that is nice in the spring and fall.',4
'Im not much of a club person so I dont know how useful my assessment will be. Im usually much more content to have a drink at Hannys or get tanked on Sake bombers at Moira. Both times Ive been here its not been very crowded which is just fine with me. The downstairs is cool and they have a nice upstairs outdoor bar as well. Drinks arent cheap but not too pricey either. The crowd is usually OK too not too Scottsdale for me.  While Bar Smith would not be my first choice of places to go to I certainly would never veto the idea either',3
'We order the chicken nachos and Turkey burger. It was just OK nothing special the chicken was dried out and tough to eat on the nachos. The service was good and had plenty of TVs to watch the games.',3
'Have stayed here before and very much like this hotel and its location.  Superb value.  They have done a lot of remodeling and still are working on a few of the final touches when complete this is going to be a super nice property.  One thing that caught my attention and I think is really cool is the pool is 10 feet deep on the deep end.  When is the last time you saw something like that?  Most hotels pools are only like 4-5 deep due to fear of drowning liability.  I am a huge fan of deep pools and rare they are to find.  So for me that is another nice feature to this property.  It is in a quiet area of town and lots of neat things around to do.. just 3 miles from Camel Back Drive and tons to do on that road.. The surrounding beauty makes this property even nicer if you find flaws which every hotel will have.',4
'Bistro 24 has really nice food with an excellent and interesting bread assortment. Every time I have been there whether while working or not I have had excellent service. I must confess one day at lunch I asked what was going to be that nights dessert.  Not only did the server tell us but he brought us one. It was a fresh out of the oven chocolate macaroons that wasnt going on the menu until evening. It melted in my mouth.It is service and food like that which keep bringing me back.',4
'Steakburgers are AWESOME.  Love this place!!  the FRIES are PHENOMINAL!!!!!!!!!   FIVE GUYS BURGERS???????  Please!!!  Freddys tops five guys.',4
'GARBAGE! But hey the portions of it are huge!!! Sorry I cant testify to any dishes here.',1
'I met up with a great friend from High School Jay Lessard for the first time tonight. I have to say that the food was amazing and the service was equally as good. I will definitely come here again!',5
'I loved this place and the double-soy-cappuccino was one of the best I have ever tasted.  The Cap was made perfectly... awesome thick foam tasty coffee great cup (haha srsly the cup is great).  The inside is filled with art and has a cool vibe.  $2.50 for a double-soy-cap not bad.  I just wish this place was closer to me Id be a regular.',5
'Most amazing Pasta ever.  Whole wheat pasta was fresh and tastes amazing.  Panzerotto (Pizza Roll) was also one of a kind.  I cant wait to come back!',5
'My first time. First impression this is a better burger chain.

I ordered the tri-tip steak sandwich on sourdough and fries. $6. Fries. $1.80 My sandwich was really good. Eating in the car was a mistake tho.

'The food was amazing and the service was great. I had the lobster and shrimp tacos and the grilled sweet corn with the strawberry Serrano guacamole. They have an impressive selection of tequila and great variety of margaritas. The only thing I will say is that the food did take some time to get to us ( like 35 minutes) but if youve ever gone to brand new restaurants teamwork and timing is shortly acquired after opening week. I highly recommend this this place if you want good baja Mexican food and great service.',5
'Tops Liquor is perfect! I have been in walking/biking distance from them for the past 4 years its an amazing store.  They have a huge selection of everything; beer wine spirits not only an awesome selection but the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  Im not so much a beer drinker but every time I go in and ask for a bottle of wine they are always spot on with their suggestion.   As long as I am in the state of Arizona I will be at Tops Liquor.',5
'Meat and potatos this place is small yet excellent in their dinner service and atmosphere!  Laid back with no pressure to get out the door.  The salad bar is huge I think they have everything that you want and a few things I wouldnt put on a salad.  People are friendly and helpful.  Checked in a few months ago and they were remodleing due to a fire but am anxious to check back in and see if they havent lost their touch.',5
'A fun lunch joint close to the Central corridor but with restrictive parking so their delivery service is handy for those in-office events.  The menu is easy to navigate and if youre a slice and a soda kind of guy this is your place. Well two slices anyway. The counter help was efficient and suggested several combinations he preferred which we fond helpful.  We were sorted through the ordering/payment process in under 30 seconds start to finish.   I had a great Chicken Florentine sandwich and my companion ordered the Meatball Parmigiana. Both were a little slow in their preparation but were put up to the window piping hot and with a fresh bag of Lays potato chips.  The chicken was properly cooked and the sub roll it was served on was slightly crunchy but mostly chewy and tasted fresh-baked. The mozzarella was a tad lacking and the mushrooms tasted blanched but the fresh spinach made up for all that.  The meatball parm was a delight as the meatballs lacked that disgusting MSG-esque aftertaste and filler so common with cheap frozen commissary-style meatballs. The sauce well that was just delightful - a little acidic and sweet but tasting fully of ripened tomatoes all the way. This sandwich was adorned with kalamata olives and roasted peppers. Yum.  The ambiance is deli-meets-Olive Garden (in a way) and count on waiting in line for the bathroom facilities when its lunch rush. There is room to have a bunch of people in the back room but it will get incredibly noisy. Screaming children have no place here.  Bottom line:  Reasonably priced decent ambiance awful parking delightful staff.',4
'Of course they are no La Madeliene but if you are looking for some good croissants this is the place to be. I love love love their croissants. But which bakerys croissants do I not love? hmm... But I do love theirs. I have had the almond croissant the almond and chocolate croissant and finally today when we went there I had the chocolate croissant. It was just freaking amazing. Thats all I can say. (They run out of the chocolate almond croissants pretty quickly so go early if you want some)  I have also had lunch here before some Mediterranean sandwich stuff. The portion is very small compared to the price. Their macaroons look crazy and funky. Have not tried them yet but plan on doing so next time. I almost gave them 4 stars because their hours they are open are very weird. But its okay I will compromise Essence Bakery.   They only use butter imported from Normandy in their Croissants. Wow.',5
'Ventured here for lunch  today with my good friend Austin. Another successful lunch!   The Chuck Box knows exactly who their customers are exactly what they offer and they execute with precision. Charcoal grilled burgers fries or onion rings and a condiment bar with the essentials to finish off your meal how you like it. A home bbq weekend when ever youre in the mood.  Its simple its effective and above all its good.  Their cash only policy is a minor annoyance that you quickly forget after sinking your teeth into the fresh-off-the-grill meal.',4
'I like pizza but its always been hard to distinguish why I would choose one pizza over another. This pizza had good cheese...that pizza had good pizza crust....but what makes a pizza memorable? I still dont know the answer but one example of a pizza that stands out is Spinatos.   I discovered Spinatos cheesy goodness years ago. My sister asked me to pick up a pizza from this place called Spinatos on the way to her house but actually...it wasnt even technically on the way to her house. Having never heard of Spinatos I figured it was just going to be another average joe pizza experience. Then she told me what she ordered: sausage and pepperoni. Sausage? Really? But she swore by it which was random for her to swear by sausage so I went with it thinking either shes gone off the rocker or this pizza might be something different. I had to smell the pizza for a 10 minute drive on the way to her house. It took everything in me not to pull over on the side of the road and gobble a slice then and there but for me its almost as much about the experience eating the food as the food itself so I wanted to cherish the moment. So to make a long story short I got home took one bite of the pizza tasted this sweet and salty sausage on fresh dough with the cheesy of all cheeses and I knew why my sister made me drive out of my way to pick it up.   Now I live by about 10 pizza places but I would actually drive the 20 minutes to Spinatos for this pizza. Its hard to explain but its something about the combination of ingredients and the authentic pizza parlor feel when you bite into a slice. Its just one of those pizzas you have to try in your life. So if you are ever in the area or up for a drive my suggestion is giving Spinatos a try. For pizza in Arizona it aint bad!',5
'if you want to cool off on a HOT day Fat Tuesdays is the place I prefer happy hour because getting a deal always makes me a happy camper!  THIS PLACE IS DEAD A LOT - SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO RAGE THIS IS NOT THE PLACE but it is perfect place to cool down and chat with a few friends...   - If your having southern withdrawls and looking to feel at home the decor makes you feel like your down town burban street.',3
'Disclaimer: I have only had takeout from Noodles Ranch although when I picked up my food the inside of the restaurant looked cozy and was pretty busy for a weeknight. I LOVE pho and was amazingly surprised to find a Vietnamese restaurant near Old Town Scottsdale not to mention one with very good food. I always find it somewhat humorous when a Vietnamese restaurant also sells things like Pad Thai and Chow Mein but my husband seemed to like the Pad Thai a lot so Im not one to complain.   I shared the spring rolls with shrimp pork veggies and a side of peanut hoisin sauce with my husband and they were very refreshing and flavorful especially the sauce. Despite the fact that it was a balmy 105 degrees outside I was in the mood for pho so I also ordered the Pho Chicken which was a huge portion. I was so pleasantly surprised to see the broth the noodles the chicken and the fixins (bean sprouts chili pepper Thai basil jalapenos) packaged separately to avoid overcooking the chicken and noodles and overall sogginess. I doused my soup in hot chili sauce after adding in all of the ingredients and I must say - it pho was delicious!!!! I was sweating when I was finished but it was my fault and SO worth it.   I will definitely go back to try some of the other options on the menu. Or maybe to just get another bowl of the pho. I am a creature of habit after all...',4
'Average cofee. Local vendor for cofee no doubt; but they dont know how to make a good cup of joe. Sandwich was average. About the only thing that was good was the pastery I ordered. I was not impresseed and would return eventually for another pastery if I hadnt herd who I awesume is the owner speaking to her employees. She was beyond rude and hurtful to them. I will not return to this place All because of that aweful lady owner.',1
'I want to discuss the excellence of the food here but first the bread alone is worth mentioning:  Think of the best bread you can buy at a regular grocery store even from their bakery.  Now imagine a bread that is much better a solid 5 or 6 times better and you have the Wildflower Bakery bread.  They offer a variety of artisan styles and they will slice the loaves for you.  I say loaves because you should buy at least two.  Now on to the menu:  This is a breakfast and lunch place.  All of the items that come with bread are you guessed it made with the wonderful bread  mentioned above.  All of the sandwiches are outstanding.  A few that stick out to me are:  BLT sandwich  Sweet potato sandwich  Beef Brisket sandwich   All of the breakfasts are healthy tasty and leave you feeling energized.  I wish Harlows in Tempe had this type of food. Wildflower is delicious fresh and healthy.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to your table.  It always seems like you wont get a table when they are busy but as if by the use of magic we always get a table well before our food is ready.  I have never had a bad experience and the consistency of what they offer is astounding.  It impresses me when a company can be so good so often.',5
'Sold me a fake bag.',1
'Food was great. Place was packed which made it difficult because we were kinda left on our own. We definitely needed more little plates of Kimchi. The service leaves much to be desired but the food is unparalleled. I love the way it comes out super hot and fast. The menu could use better descriptions of the dishes or pictures. It was difficult to tell exactly what you are ordering if you are not a speaker of Korean or familiar with their foods.',4
'I used to stop at this store but since they changed it (for the worst) I wont bother to go there again. The parking has always been a nightmare (and still is). I didnt see one thing worth spending my money on. You can find much better stuff at Antigue Gatherings (on Indian School) and the prices there are still very reasonable.',1
'Massive group dinner (60+) which is always a concern since they have to prep multiple dishes at the same time.  Steak - Mine was medium with some nice give!  Tasty and enjoyable! Chicken - Crisped skin cooked through but not overcooked nicely done! Dessert - Apple pie flaky crust with cinnamon ice cream.  Ice cream lacked the strong cinnamon flavor I expected to the point I thought that maybe it was just vanilla ice cream.  But the pie crust was nice!  Overall it was a good experience and enjoyable time with all my co-workers!  Nothing phenomenal but good solid food.  Id look forward to coming back with a smaller party and trying something more particular to their restaurant to see if there are any hidden gems to enjoy....',3
'Delicious and tastes like the food in Thailand. Definitely to return for mieng kum!',5

'We went to Apollos Saturday night with a group that included Kristin S. Christine O. and their significant others. Apparently on the weekends there is karaoke and let me tell you this is not your average karaoke experience! I mean karaoke where 3/4 of the people that sing actually have decent to really good voices?? Geez where are the horrible screeching renditions of Total Eclipse of the Heart or Fergalicious??? Oh wait...thats right my husband was there and sang the latter...and he was awful but in a funny way. If you do go to participate in karaoke there are plenty of TV screens with the words. I really liked that a few TVs were reserved to show football and Sportscenter!  Apollos itself is a moderately sized establishment with an outdoor patio. I only saw the ladies bathroom cleverly marked with a Goddesses sign but it was tiny; however there was never a line as most of the crowd was of the male persuasion. My husband and I had beer so I cant comment on the prices for mixed drinks or shots but beer was cheaper than most places I have been to in the Valley. Bud light drafts were $2.75 and Fat Tire drafts were $3. Since I was the designated driver that evening I switched to soda halfway through the night which was $2 and included free refills. The bartenders were extremely friendly and very prompt in service. There is also a waiter that floats throughout the space if you dont want to go up to the bar.  The crowd ebbed and flowed throughout the evening but it never got so full of people where I was getting knocked into or where it was impossible to move. All and all a very laid back place where you can just hang out chat and enjoy singing along with Sweet Caroline.',4
'Standard Burger King fare served at a snails pace.  One cook one sandwich maker one cashier plus 30 people in the queue.  Please help the economy and the waiting customers by hiring some staff!',2
'The food is still as crappy as it was ten years ago. The service at this new spot lacking since it is full of airheads. I realize that the girls are not selected for high IQ but I expect them to know when to ask me if I want more or if I want the check. It is a very simple process. I will not return as there are many places that make a much better hot wing for less than one dollar per wing. If you seek cute costumes in a sports bar choose TILTED KILT over this place any day of the week.',1
'I just got done wolfing down a chili relleno burrito...that  was so AMAZING I looked here to see what everyone else thought but was shocked to see I am the 1st to review here! According to the bag my food was in there are 10 locations.  I guess that makes it a franchise nonetheless its killer. You know how you order something and its a bigger portion than you expected and you think theres no way I can eat this much- but then take a bite and its so good you just end up eating way more than your body is prepared for? Thats how delicious it was.  Since I am new to this area I listen when someone recommends a place to go do -well just about anything.  I am also big on trying to take the source of the referral into consideration. But in this case pretty much everyone Ive met has told me how great this place is..I decided to check it out and grabbed some dinner on my way home.  Instead of hitting one of the many corporate franchise drive thrus on the way home I went to theirs.. I didnt see what I wanted on the menu so I asked if they had it. The guy said yes they do and then handed me a white bag about 1.5 min later.  I dont know if it was cream cheese or some kind of Cojita Cheese but whatever they stuffed the pepper with it was super tasty! They also put Lettuce Onions Some enchilada sauce and cilantro in the burritos!! My stomach is so full right now I have to lay down after I write this!! Parking is no problem. They have a drive thru! YES-its a little on the worn out side- but they do have one! Open 24hrs. They have fresh juice horchata and tamarind drinks',5
'This is a good spot to get good cheap margaritas after work and a snack. The music was really loud where we were sitting so it was hard to hear each other but the service was great. We had an attentive friendly waitress and chips with cheese dip that was yummy. The patio and cabanas look like a fantastic spot to hang out when it is not 115 degrees. : ) Good pick for after a long day at the office!',3

'= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =   Ah happiness is a shopping center with THREE Buffets in it!  SO resisting Chutneys & especially excellent China Town Buffet I stopped in here for a first visit to this Peter Piper today.  I found friendly service comfortable booth seating a clean dining room proper lighting and acoustics (for a pizza parlor) and the room temperature right.  Along with the above lunch started with three tasty tossed salad varieties:  Garden Ranch Classic Caesar & Apple Harvest.  The host offered to have any pizza I desired fixed for me so I ordered up a thin crust with Pepperoni & Italian Sausage.  By the time I was finished with salad it was being pulled from the oven by a sweet andrygynous cook lady whos name I didnt get loaded up with lots of meat & it was GREAT!  (YAY MEAT!)  Slices of other pizzas that I enjoyed were one with lots of cheese only one with Italian Sausage mushrooms & Bell Pepper on whole wheat crust and another with Pepperoni & slices of Jalepeño Pepper which was tamed down a little by the baking.  This whole feast was only $5.49 & with everything just right this Peter Piper earned 5 Stars!     :-))  PS:  If its been a long time since you tried Peter Piper & thought the pizza tasted like cardboard come back & see how much theyve improved!',5
'I stay in Hiltons enough to be a Diamond member by June and let me tell you this hotel and its staff was absolutely below expectations. First off they have two buildings. If you are placed in The North Building the rooms are disgustingly dirty there are cigarette butts pretty much everywhere and there are literally NO employees to be found for assistance. The pool was overrun by people who where there to drink and swear.  To top it off the front desk staff is hands down the rudest group of individuals. Here you have an opportunity to establish first a first impression and they fall flat on their face by exhibiting a who cares mentality. This entire hotel is a complete disaster and if you have a family I would recommend anywhere else but this place.   Also we came back to our room from swimming to find a worker in the bathroom. He said someone called the front desk about a slow drain.  We never called them and the drain worked fine. It just added to the overall F grade visit.',1
'Be warned.  A trip to Lo-Los will shave precious minutes off of your life.  Ah heck.  Im not a health nut and if youre taking a gander at Lo-Los reviews odds are neither are you.  Take a ride on the unhealthy side and enjoy your meal.    This morning marked my first visit to Lo-Los.  I wanted to hit up the original location south of downtown Phoenix but time dictated I opt for the closer location in Scottsdale.  The restaurant was of decent size and comfy.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Placed my order and it arrived quickly (easily within 15 minutes).    I ordered Sheedahs Special which consisted of a fried chicken breast & wing and a waffle and a side of grits.  For a beverage I ordered a Dr. Pepper and it arrived in a Kerrs canning jar.  Nice touch.  The waffle was unique and tasted of cinnamon.  The chicken was outstanding.  Seriously it ranks as some of the best Ive had.  Lo-Los should sell the chicken by the bucket.  My only gripe with Lo-Los is the ghetto glorification youll see on the menu and the t-shirts.  A small annoyance that does not get in the way of the delicious food.',4
'The store manager got back with me via Yelp which I greatly appreciate.  In thinking further about my review Ive amended it somewhat to reflect that the store is much more than just framing.  I would still not recommend their framing department but the rest of the store is well-organized and has a huge selection of art supplies.  Plus the staff seems very eager to offer expert assistance if you want it.  So a 1 star for framing and a 5 star for supplies leaves me with an aggregate 3 star review.',3
'Cool place that isnt over-crowded or full of frills. Simply put its clean the staff is on the ball and the beer is fantastic. Sent them a pic of my pup to put on the slideshow of dogs so now I have to go back again to see if they put that adorable face on the 42 inch screen. No food no problem. Visit the pizza guy outside. For me liquid dinner is just fine.',5
'My family and I had the pleasure to dine here again last night.  Its the fourth time we have been there since they opened.  We remembered how much we enjoyed Daniels before it closed and was hoping the food would be as good.  As you can probably guess since we have been there four times in a few months the food is fabulous.  Everyone we have dined with rave about the food.  Appetizers are creative and well priced (We had the snails - awesome!).  The dinner menu is as well.  I like the trattoria feel inside and have never had bad service.  Caffe Daniel is just introducing their winter menu (we got a sneak preview) and its worth the trip.  I had a wood fired steak with gorgonzola sauce that may be the best plate of food Ive had all year (and I eat out often).  It was served with Au Gratin Potatoes that I had to fight my wife and daughter for.  The new menu has at least 10 more things Im anxious to try on return trips.  The rest of the family had the lasagna which is made with a wonderful veal ragu.  Absolutely killer!  The wine list is smallish but well crafted and priced right.  We had the 2009 Monsanto Chianti Riserva (#31 on the Spectator 2012 Top 100) priced at $44 per bottle which is less than twice retail.  Very fair.      If your looking for a new restaurant to try this is it.',5
'This is the place Id imagine Glendales bizarro world version of Walter Donny and The Dude go to knock back a few tasty brews after a long night of cigarettes yappity pomeranians arguing the intricacies of bowling with fragile vietnam vets and being threatened with sodomy from Latino pederasts. The Hoot Owl has probably the most ironically hip 70s retro throwback interiors that I have ever stumbled across in a west side bar and I mean this without a trace of ire. From the minute I stepped in I was in my element. As a general rule I tend not to drink too far from home but this little hideaway is nestled in a strip mall very near to my lovely mothers house so an obligatory visit and couch crash isnt outside of the realm of possibilities. Whats more is that right down the street is mi comida next door is nam sao and across the street is rainbow grocery outlet - not one but three of my favorite places! The Hoot Owl makes it four!  The patrons of the Hoot all seemingly know each other and that neighborhood bar vibe is rampant which could be great or bad you decide. The drinks are ridiculously cheap and the service: attentive jocund and generally somewhat reminiscent of my auntie deb; who herself is the embodiement of the previous qualities if somewhat a little anachronistic. There is a jukbox and pool table both of which are usually hogged by the regulars. The Booths are plush camel coloured leather and the lighting the perfect amount of dim. I could easily see myself spending a great deal of my time here if I lived in Glendale and godwilling that never happens I will always have the option.',3
'I first reviewed Pink Spot when it was first open and was all about ice cream.   Since then they have made little incremental changes here and there and WHEEE!  its gotten even better.   Coffee & Espresso at really great prices and a wide variety of interesting drinks.  Very skilled baristas and very high quality beans... one shot keeps me buzzing all day!     They are open at 6 am and dont close until 9pm or later most days now.   And - cool - just pull up and beep and theres curbside service.   (I have to admit that feels a bit too lazy to me so I cant do it; but I suppose if I was trying to get some work done in the car it would be convenient!)    But if your office is nearby - DELIVERY!!!!  Can Starbucks do THAT?  I dont theeeenk so!  Another great add:  free live music some evenings!   Ive stopped in several times to ZPizza next door and discovered there was a great little band playing at Pink Spot - sometimes REALLY AWESOME music.  In fact one time went in to pick up my ZPizza to go planning my lonely night in front of the TV at home... pleasently listening to the Beatles playing on the sound system. . . but  I went to get my lemonade WHAT?!!!  It was three guys playing live covering John Paul & George perfectly - awesome!      Ive found at Pink Spot they are always innovating so even if you didnt dig it the last time you were in check it out again.   I think youll like it.   Im really glad they are smack-dab in between work and home for me its a frequent stop!',5
'Unfortunately Jug n Barrel has closed.',4
'This is definitely a place for a business traveler. The rooms at the back of the property are very quiet. The best part of the hotel room is the comfortable bed. Its topped with a down comforter and triple sheeting...its so high off the ground that I had to jump into bed every night. The room is spacious and warm. Ill definitely stay here again when I am in the Phoenix area!',4
'Went here for Cinco De Mayo for a a margarita. They were pretty good and not over priced. Very cool looking building! Service was pleasant but overall the restaurant wasnt overly impressive but I would still go back agian!',3
'I stopped at this salon only after Shea Nails (which had come highly recommended) didnt have anyone available to do a mani/pedi for about an hour. There were a couple of other customers in Crystal Nails but I was taken promptly. The first thing I noticed was that the metal supply carts between the pedicure chairs are FILTHY and so gross. I know... I should have left then....but Im just not that type of person. The gentleman doing my mani/pedi was very nice and did a good job Although I was annoyed that he seemed more interested at watching what was going on on the tv then my nails Looking around I was just amazed at the consistent level of dirtiness.....light switches stools counters floor.......I know that there is a lot of nail dust created when youre doing acrylic nails....but- then you should have a routine to clean it!  The final nail in the coffin was when another customer came in and my guy finished up my nails and headed over to start her pedicure with the same little boxes of tools he had just used on me EWWWWWWWWWWWw. I dont understand why it is SO hard to find nail places that have good sanitary practices!?  All I want is some place that speaks clear English and uses clean instruments!',2
'Decent ambience. Mediocre service. Terrible food. All the meat was overlooked and had no flavor. We ordered fajitas and fundido. They were inedible. I didnt even bother sending them back. Would not return - even if I was starving',1
'Phillies famous is an amazing place to go if you really like cheesesteaks youre gonna love this place give it a try you wont be sorry',5
'I ordered a pizza and he the crust was doughy',1
'Not only is the coffee great tasting and the chai delicious but the friendliness and customer service is awesome.  My friend frequents this location (every morning before work) and when hes needed a ride due to his car being dropped off for work done I have driven him here on the way.  To attest to the quality of the place he drives daily to this location despite the fact that its about 15 minutes (without traffic) past his workplace - where they greet him by name and have his usual orders memorized.  I have enjoyed the freezes coffee and chai (which is my favorite).  Drinks are full flavored and although their menu is limited they have something for pretty much everyone.  I havent tried any of their food items but he does get a muffin in the mornings which looked pretty good.  It is a small location on the corner with a drive-through and a side window for those able to park and pick up their coffee in their limited lot but its friendly and has a very pleasant atmosphere.  When Im craving a nice spiced chai I head over to this location even though its past some other coffee shops for the flavor consistency friendliness and service.',5
'Good source to Kill your Carne Asada Burrito hunger!  this thing is big and cheap... real steak sliced up and well grilled (upon request) I always eat it california style which is to have everything including rice and beans inside. I do it dry style which is no sauce/gravy on top... that way I can pick it up dump some hot sauce on it and crush it!  this place is open late in fact 24 hours i believe... I have gone there at all hours of the morning only to find the food cheap and cheerful. The help is friendly but the bar crowd have pretty much destroyed the bathroom so dont expect much in that department.',4
'The food is not to complain here we had the curry chicken katsu and hawaiian bbq combo (korean rib pork beef rice & macaroni salad) and aloha saimen. All sooo delectable with the egg spam green onion combo in the saimen noodle soup. Sounds really strange but you gotta try it it is deliious!   Its really too bad that it took 30 min. for me to get my food there were only 3 customers in the store and we were all taking it to go...so why does it take that long? It looked like there was only 1 person running the register and cooking at the same time. Wish the service was as good as the food!',4
'My neighbor took me here for my bday the other day...it was Tuesday evening and we had to wait 20-25 minutes - I dont know the last time Ive been to a restaurant and waited since I tried to avoid that HOWEVER it was worth the wait.  Because i loved the dessert so much lets start with that!  Of course as its been mentioned before dessert is the cookie - ooey gooey half baked cookie dough (we chose the classic chocolate chip) with 2 scoops of ice cream. Yummy yummy heavenly orgasm!  I like dessert and i like cookies and this was just delicious. I wish there was a way to get this to go so I could eat it in the privacy of my own home - the things I would do to that cookie pizza :) ok really Id probably eat the whole thing in 2 minutes and let my stomach bloat like it never has before. not so sexy huh?  the CUSTOMER SERVICE was AWESOME. From the list person to the drink people to the waitress and every other employee we encountered (there are SEVERAL or all the cute boys looked the same dont know which one) all were pleasant nice helpful. I really dont know that Ive ever gotten better service.  On to the main attraction....we got the ORiva Pizza - large to take home leftovers and it was good - not a traditional pizza at all and probably not the best pizza ive ever had but would i go back definitley would i order the same pizza you bet. Would i try something else though yep.   Great atmosphere great employees great food.  Oh cant believe i almost forgot...the alcohol! My friend got the bellini - VERY tasty and i got the Dirty Monkey - not quite as tasty but still good and one definitely got me buzzin (not the intent of the drink just the effect). Would probably try a different drink - the inital taste of the DM was good but left a funny after taste.',4
'Came here for dinner on 9-6-2012 with my mom and son. My first time here but my moms fifth or sixth time. Excellent food really nice place! But the best thing was the service. Matt benton(sp) was our server and he was seriously really good. I have been a server for about six years and he was great he was extremely fast and precise and split our salad without being asked. Very knowledgeable and friendly. I will definitely be back he got three out of the five stars because he made the experience better!!!',5
'Love Wendys new salads and burgers. This was my first visit to this particular location and I found it to be very clean. I felt bad for the guy running the cash register because no one was helping him but he was very polite.',4
'Went on a Friday night seated immediately on a cold night outside with heaters...was a very good experience.  Wife had an Appletini and a Pomegranate martini and were awesome.  I opted for the root beer house made and yes it was very good.  We split a pizza meat on one side for me and olives on the other for her-was a very good pizza.  Would definitely recommend.....oh and the cookies for desert was awesome.',4
'Best Italian restaurant in AZ. Been going for years. Great people and amazing food!    Must haves: minestrone soup lasagna meatballs PICATTA and the sea bas pomodora. Everything is great but those are my favorites.   Food prices are fair. $13 for pasta and soup or salad. $20 for chicken with pasta and soup or salad. Cheap for great food!!  This place is always busy. Make a reservation. And if you have to wait 15 20 minutes after your reservation its worth it!!  Its definitely a little crazy sometimes but the owner and workers have an awesome personality.   A MUST go to in Old Town!!!!!',5
'Was driving on Baseline this morning and noticed the car was not driving smoothly so I pulled over to check and saw I had a flat. Fortunately I was in the Discount Tires lot when I pulled over so I went inside and had them take care of the tire. The tire was not repairable but they had an exact replacement in stock. I bought the new tire with warranty and had my wheels balanced and tires rotated while I was there. They got everything done very quickly and I was on my way. I liked the fast friendly service.',5
'Great friendly service. The morning crew know and remember their customers. The drinks are out fast. My favorite store in Phoenix.',5
'This place is horrible. I was in the neighborhood and wandered in hungry and low bloodsugar-ing. I was hoping for something approximating my favorite Mongolian bbq place at home in CA but would have been ok with anything edible I was so hungry. So the bar was not exactly set high but they still totally failed to clear it.   The meats and seafood were nasty and disturbingly old-looking. The sauces and toppings were basically anything but Mongolian -- pre-mixed ketchup based sauces all of them disgustingly sweet instead of various oils and garlic and spice sauces you usually get at Mongolian places. The noodles were basically Italian pasta. My request for sesame seeds was met with confusion (though they did manage to produce a bowlful for me eventually) and there was no pocket bread to be found. And when I got my bowl back it was bland soggy and limp; it had been drenched with water because the sugar in the sauces would have burned on the grill without it. Ya THINK? I ended up just fearfully picking out the meat and left the rest still hungry.  While I was still in line filling my bowl I realized I forgot some shrooms and asked the grim midwestern couple behind me if I could do a quick reach back for a few. You would have though Id asked to do a reach-around instead they acted so outraged I might hold up the procession to get the food into their mouths as fast as possible. Weve been waiting in line already!! one of them barked out. Seriously. They pretty much exemplified the only people who could be happy with what you get at Genghis Grill. Chunksters who only care about all-you-can-shovel dreck in minimal time.  Sorry guys youre nowhere near my type and neither is Genghis NON-Mongolian Stir Fry. You couldnt pay me to do either. Will not be back.',1
'The ambiance is as delectable as the sushi...but for someone who doesnt care much about seeing or being seen I did not enjoy the 45-minute wait for a spot at the sushi bar. I agree with the other reviewer if all youre after is good sushi go at odd hours',3
'I stopped by this Paradise Bakery location today and ordered a half sandwich and salad roasted turkey artichoke and chopped chicken cobb to go.  When I got home I attacked my salad with the fury of 10000 screaming Dothraki raiders...  it didnt last long the salad was delicious.  Thats when the horde that was my hunger turned its attention to the isolated and vulnerable half sandwich.  The attack was over as quickly as it began.  It came as great surprise that the half sandwich had erected impenetrable stone defenses otherwise known as bread.  Sad day you say?  I think not!  I called the location to voice my complaint the bread on the sandwich was burnt and rock hard.  By this time the store had closed but the very sweet manager not only offered me a whole sandwich to replace the concrete half sandwich but a full refund as well.  I drove back got my sandwich a refund and a bag of free cookies.  The food at every Paradise Bakery Ive been to has been good but the customer service tonight was incredible.  That to me is what sets any establishment apart from the rest.  The food at any random place could be great but if the service is lacking and unfriendly I will never return.  I will be back.',4
'This bar is inside the terminal at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport so unless you will only find this place if you are in Terminal .  I give this place three stars primarily for their staff.  The food actually comes from the Jody Maroni place next door and although they call themselves a brewing company they do not actually produce their own local brew.  So as one other reviewer accurately puts it this is essentially just a bar.  What made my visit truly enjoyable was the staff.  I was there on Friday afternoon at around 4pm and both the bartender (I sat at the bar) and the waitress were very friendly and engaging.  I threatened to become a regular there since my weekly trips to Phoenix will put me in this terminal every Friday.  They laughed and said they would quickly change their schedules.  I didnt really look at the price of the beer they sold me but its an airport bar... of course the prices will be higher than at a neighborhood establishment. The burger was just about the worst burger I have ever had in my life. But then again I was eating Jody Maroni... I should have ordered a brat or sausage or a dog... not a burger.',3
'This was my first visit to Berthas. I will definitely be returning... possible tomorrow to try their breakfast. We had the roasted turkey sandwich & the grilled asparagus with roasted chicken sandwich. Both are amazing!! Everything is so fresh. Its a cute little deli kinda tucked away in the corner. If you didnt know about it you probably wouldnt know it was there.',5
'Just went today for the first time today and definitely LOVED it! The gentlemen making drinks was super friendly and the coffee was awesome! Very clean and great relaxing atmosphere. Def will be going regularly.',5
'Breakfast food is the best food. I order a tofu scramble burrito and my partner ordered the Ranchero skillet. I loved mine. I tried a few bites of the Ranchero skillet  and that was awesome despite the super hard tortilla it came with. I enjoyed the earthy ambiance and love eating organic. I am curious to try this place out again. However I am not sure how often I could realistically eat there based on the prices. Over $30 for 2 breakfast entrees a lemonade and an iced americano is a bit pricey.  Overall my first time at Pomegranate Cafe was a delicious experience.',4
'Not great salsa and not a lot of options for the vegetarian. Oh well ok place for a quick lunch.',2
'I have stayed at this hotel a couple times before and kept on coming back because it fulfilled my basic needs. The rooms seemed larger than most standard hotel rooms and my king sized bed was plush and comfortable. The furnishings seemed dated but that didnt bother me. It was adequate and the free WiFi was a great bonus. I thought it was refreshing to see the comforter set in a nice rich blue color rather than the gaudy brightly patterned comforter sets I have been accustomed to in most hotels.   On one visit I found a LIVE cockroach just hanging around on the ceiling and was absolutely freaking out. I notified the front desk about this and they quickly moved me to another room which I thought was nice of them to do. The location of the hotel is pretty close to an AMC plaza just a few minutes down the I-17 so my boyfriend (a Phoenix native) and I would often frequent the plaza to catch a movie and grab a quick bite or have a nice meal. Oh and they have free continental breakfast! Not the best of breakfast items just your typical pastries cereal and juice. The dining areas usually crowded with other hotel patrons so I usually brought food to my room. Didnt venture out to the pool because I had forgotten to pack sunblock and didnt want to bake under the sun. The pool seemed like your standard hotel pool. Nothing special. Their fitness center was pretty small and very dated. Most of the equipment had been abused and nobody took the time to repair or replace them. It didnt matter much to me as long as I squeezed in some form of exercise in my day; I was content. The hotel was clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and accommodating.',2
'Five stars on the service alone today; I really wish that I remembered our waitresses name but she was the cutest bundle of happiness way too early in the morning! Awesome service super helpful in our order and down right genuinely happy.  Food- five stars. Had the Healthy One (as always Im a subject of habit at the Good Egg) with a side of dollar pancakes. Delish.  The Man had the Farmhouse; his words were silenced by the eating. He ate every bite than moved onto my leftovers.   Devoured the pancakes like they were going out of style woofed down my english muffins because they have blackberry jelly and had four cups of Irish Cream coffee A-mazing.   One piece of advise ALWAYS order the flavored coffee of the day. And if they have chocolate chip please message me; Im in dire need of a fix!',5
'Nice airport! Small efficient very friendly and very professional. The drive to the airport from where I live was the only reason I didnt give it 5-stars.',4
'Within the past two weeks my boyfriend and I have been to this Petsmart nearly every day and have interacted with almost all of the employees (as we have been in at all times of the day).  Honestly we didnt go into Petsmart with particularly high hopes. To be clear the lack of expectations is not a reflection on this store or on Petsmart as a general whole but Petsmart isnt a place that I go looking to be pampered.  That being said I have to give a shout out to this stores group of employees (especially the two girls in the fish department) who have been overwhelmingly helpful on each of our visits. The two fish tank specialists have started to recognize us and always greet us by saying Youre back!  Here is a list of other things that have pleasantly surprised me about this Petsmart (and you know how I love lists): 1. These Petsmart employees always make themselves available. Unlike other pet stores where the majority of your time is spent milling around looking for someone to help you in this Petsmart enough employees work each shift so that if you need attention you will get it. 2. This particular Petsmart is very very clean. I have yet to see a mess of any sort. They also have a nice cleaning regiment for their fish tanks which always look nice anyway. 3. When we decided to invest in a 10 gallon tank starter kit I misplaced the original receipt. I was able to go back into the store and because i had used my Petsmart Perks card (or whatever they call it) the store manager was able to print out a duplicate receipt even though the transaction was from three to four days prior. Thumbs up! 4. We bought two african dwarf frogs and a ghost shrimp from Petsmart who are  happy and healthy since we brought them home and set up the tank. 5. The prices here on MOST of the items we were looking for were better than the competition.  Overall I have been very very pleased with the selection at Petsmart and will be returning today for a few more things. Im rating 4 out of 5 stars because some of the items can be found cheaper at Petco (which is the same distance from my home as Petsmart) and that the pet guarantee for fish is only 14 days at Petsmart. It is a whopping 30 days at Petco.   Please note that both of these gripes have nothing to do with the employees who are a delight.',4
'so Im stuck  in the middle with this place. Luxe  has really good food and I like the theater arcade and bowling alley but they need a SEVERE upgrade  to the staff. They  are far too immature and need to act way more professional.',2
'I finally made it here and this is the real deal. Best coney dogs Ive had since leaving the motor city. Faygo Pop Better Made chips. Glad they are open Saturday. Limited menu but I was only interested in the Coney. Give it a try if you are wanting to take care of your coney habit.',5
'I bought a groupon for Amenzone thinking I could get a little workout done on lunch since I work in the area.  I wasnt expecting much as I have been to bootcamps before and havent found one that compares to Rockstar Bootcamp.  This one does!  I was blown away my first class.  What an intense workout!  I have gone 3 times so far and I am already seeing results.  I love Taylor she is so cheery and motivates and pushes you to your potential.  I am sore all over after each class the good sore the one that reassures you that you will see results!  I will definitely be continuing this after my groupon expires.',5
'Soo upset with this place! I used to eat here all the time when I lived in Utah and I loved it I love the honey bacon club sandwich and Thai mango salad however at this location I have twice in a row now had dirty lettuce and bugs in my salad! I guess if you avoid he salads youd be fine. Soo disappointed and will never eat at this Zupas again :(',2
'The food is good. The custard is amazing. Clean and classy little Burger joint.',4
'This is a great store. The staff is really friendly and helpful the selection is good and the food quality is great.',5
'Barrio Queen has excellent food. Their table side guacamole and tacos are wonderful! If you want great food for a great price this is the place to go. However the service is slow and the owner doesnt really seem to have interest in her customers. The owner also stopped serving chips and salsa as she wanted to represent a real mexican food restaurant. I think this was a terrible idea. All in all Barrio Queen is in a fun location and the food makes it worth coming back!',4
'Okay Ill be back....   Nice floor plan not a lot of hype tasty and priced right.  Pros: 1/3 # was plenty.  Had the classic just to taste a basic no real frills (I.e. extraneous flavors) burger.  Burger was flavorful and the cheese was a little too much but thats just me.   Bun was pretty good but did have some bun-failure toward the end of mowing down the burg..   Nice presentation of burger and frys (I.e. not in cheap plastic trays) in wire serving trays.   Cons: dagnabit the frys were nothing special.  I had the fancy frys (tossed in rosemary and olive oil) no big deal actually disappointing.    I enjoyed the meal and will be back when I have a craving for cow.   Still have to give Lobbys a second chance (first round goes to Smashburger....no hype on special sauce good burger - a draw between the two... But like the decor and presentation on SB...',4
'Ive been going to this lady for 4 years. She is an European Spaniard. Her personality is just as her origin background.  An elitist. You just need to take her with a grain of salt. She is expensive but gets the job done.',2
'My friend and I went here Saturday night as he had some coupons. He went there before and figured I would enjoy it. He was right this place has great food Great customer service and was clean. The only complaint I have is I ordered the Po boy Oyster and it was in the 2 item side order area but only came with on side. I asked the lady behind the counter and she said that she was sorry but it was printed in the wrong area of the menu. I will be going back again to try out other items.',5
'Let me start off this review by saying we took my Grandma here for a very special birthday dinner that needed to go extremely well.  That being said I am rating Flemings a 4 based on my overall feeling AFTER we left the restaurant.    I had a bad feeling about our reservation here when I called before to see if I could change it to 15 minutes earlier and they said they couldnt accommodate us because they were all booked that was the first sign.  When we arrived 10 minutes before our reservation we were told to check in close to our time... which was weird because we were about 8 minutes early.  Long story short they were very busy and by 20 minutes AFTER our reservation I was a bit worried (remember this was an important b-day celebration).  I talked with the hostess and after begging she sat us.  From the point forward we were treated like royalty by our waiter and the bus boy who were both amazing.    The food was outstanding.  My Grandma and Husband both LOVED their steaks.  I had fish which was undercooked at first but I sent it back and it came back better than before.  We had the chipotle mac and cheese which was even better than it sounds.  To top it off we had the lava cake (my personal favorite) which was a treat from Flemings for my Grandmas B-day.  At the end of the meal the waiter gave my Grandma a box of chocolates which I found to be so nice and it made her day.  I will go back to Flemings for sure I loved the food... I will just try to go on a less busy day who would have thought a Sunday night would be so crazy!',4
'Never order a sandwich from a.place with Pizza in the name. The beef in my sandwich was good but the bread was soggy and gross. I ordered fries but got chips. After 20 minutes Im STILL waiting for fries with no update from my server. It isnt even busy in here. Not too pleased.  (EDIT) - Later on my sandwich was so soggy that the bread ripped in half and all the fillings fell out. Grr. No more Nellos for me~',1
'We came here for my moms birthday and by we I mean a ton of us.   Cmon were Latinos you know we mob deep and with a bunch of kids in tow.  We arrived at 7:00 p.m. on a Sunday night.  I guess kids arent allowed past 8:00 but the place was DEAD and the couple of people that were there all had kids too.    We had a great time!  The sand volleyball courts were awesome.  There was a guy on the mic singing everything from the Eagles to Michael Jackson pretty funny.  A bonfire was going and kids were roasting marshmallows.  It was a perfect night.  Unfortunately I didnt order any food or drinks but my dad said his burger was the best hes ever had.  The server was very sweet but kept forgetting things.  The bathrooms were gross.  Sure enough right after the food arrived someone came up to us and told us we had to leave when we were done eating.  I think its asinine to treat your biggest money maker of the evening like that.  No lie Im sure we doubled their revenue for the evening on booze alone.  Ok I get that they have rules and all but really there was only ONE other table by that time.  We left no problem.  Will I be back?  Yeah... I cant think of anywhere else you can play sand volleyball and booze it up.',3
'Over rated!! Small pieces of waffles for large prices. $8 for a 1/4 piece of a Belgian waffle.',1

'Shwarema plate pistachio baklava salad and coffee  Gyro plate salad and pistachio baklava  The baklava at this comfortable market was a revelation to me. I have apparently never had exceptional baklava this is now fixed.',5
'Decent food but bad service. Our waitress must have had an egg roll up her butt or something that was distracting her. In all my years of dining I dont think Ive ever had a server come to the table ask only one of the two people sitting there what they wanted to drink then walk away. Seriously - she got my friends drink order and walked away! WTF? But then get this she did it again when she came back with my friends drink and asked if we were ready to order I ordered my drink and then she turned to my friend got her order and then turned to walk away. I stopped her this time of course. Oh and then later she took my glass to get me a refill and when she didnt come back for ten minutes I started looking around for her and there she was wandering around the restaurant with it no idea which table it was from.. The food was decent like I said nothing special but edible but with that kind of service I aint going back.',2
'Just had another delicious dinner at Trattoria Bianco.Passing  by the kitchen window before we went in we saw the desserts and decadently decided to skip salad to have room for cake. for starters we shared  the polenta and sausage The polenta was creamy but had enough body to carry the slightly spicy sausage. The lasagna verde was thin layers of pasta and cheese on a bed of eggplant ragu light enough to enjoy on a 104 degree day. All I can say about my husbands Pappardelle Bolognese was he finished the last  drop of sauce by soaking it up with the perfectly crusty bread.The  dessert special chocolate chiffon cake  was covered with a layer of rich chocolatey icing and stuffed with a dark creamy ganache . My husband asked our server why he brought me a fork. He then ordered another slice to go. Just  a reminder to chef John you promised to email me the recipe.  On our way out we ran into Chris and his adorable wife. How does she stay so thin?',5
'Tuesday 39 dollar shots. Love it!',4
'My furry friend has reason enough to be distrustful of those in the medical profession given a long history of unsuccessful past treatments that ended in an amputation! And he is completely at ease when he comes here. Weve been here on three separate occasions so far - one was our Humane Society initial checkup one was a heartworm follow-up and one was an emergency sick visit. While we saw a different vet and different staff members each time we came Mr. Dog never had any apprehension to any of the people he came into contact with here. They are all really really great with him and his response to them definetly shows. He doesnt get nervous or scared and they have not only gotten me in immediately when we needed it but they have also called to follow up on the emergency visit to make sure the treatment they prescribed is working positively (it was). Pricing is not outrageous and the facility is clean and sanitary. Highly recommended.',5
'Wake up Phoenix ! You have an outstanding restaurant in your midst! Michael our server was great and the food is off the charts good. Sunday night pork is amazing. I had the scallops wow best I have had in ages and I love scallops. We will be going again while we are here maybe more than one more time! Wish we had a place like this in Dallas.',5
'Cracker Barrel = Southern staple right? Im pretty sure I heard Oprah say that once.   Part country store-part restaurant they definitely have cool things to buy. Or rather stuff that you would get say in a magazine that you would order around Christmastime or if some kid was selling stuff for school.  They sell rocking chairs for about 130 bucks apiece. But theyre really well-made and if I had enough room in my car I would have bought one and taken it home.   I dont usually tell my server that I dont eat meat when I go out. During this visit to Cracker Barrel however my friend blurted it out when I was trying to decide between salad and pancakes. In light of this my waitress was extremely helpful in trying to find me a dish to eat that would be satisfying enough to keep me full for the 5.5 hour drive home. She even went as far as taking my menu and drawing stars next to all the items I could eat. Totally unnecessary but really sweet.   Hashbrown casserole + homemade biscuits = heavenly deliciousness. And affordable too!!!',4
'I came here on a Monday night around 9PM.  There were a few small groups in the restaurant if you want to call it that.  Their burger is similar to a BBQ burger.  Nothing too unique about the taste.  Fries though were crispy and fried well.  The condiment bar was well kept and fresh.  The ambiance was pretty depressing.  I felt like I was in a tavern established along an interstate.  I needed to get in get out with something in my stomach that would get me by.  Job accomplished.',2
'My fiance and I were invited to a birthday celebration for his coworker last weekend and they picked Mastros for dinner. I had heard great things about this place and was stoked for a good steak especially since my last steakhouse experience at Donovans was a little lack luster.  Our party of 6 arrived right on time for our Saturday 8:45pm reservation and we were sat almost immediately. The atmosphere was MUCH better than Donovans and while it was much darker it felt way more intimate and high class. There was some odd music..like the top 40 hits you hear on the radio but luckily our dinner mates were great to talk to and I only noticed it when I sat down.  Our waitress was outstanding the whole evening and the bread basket contained a small long loaf of pretzel bread that was delicious! I was convinced by another couple at our table that my fiance and I should share the Chefs Cut Ribeye Chop at 33oz. While Im a filet fan all the way I thought I would break out of my norm and go with their recommendation. My fiance and I also ordered the warm spinach salad that was delicious! The egg and warm bacon dressing were so yummy!   Since we had three couples each of us ordered different sides to try. We got the $32 Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Yes. $32 for some white potatoes. Now I dont like seafood but these were pretty good. I was able to give my lobster chunks away but they were definitely good and decadent. The other sides we tried were Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese Green Beans with Sliced Almonds Asparagus - Steamed. They were all good but at the waitresses recommendation  we also ordered the creamed spinach. This was one of the top creamed spinaches Ive had. Very rich. Very good.   Another very nice touch was when our dinner was served we were swarmed by several waiters each with one of our sides to serve each person at the table. Typically they are placed on the table and you each pass them around so this was a definite nice touch. Our steak was also good but I was reminded about why I order filets. While the meat had a great flavor all the fat marbled throughout the steak just seemed like too much. Everyone else enjoyed their immensely so maybe Im just the odd ball? Or because they didnt want to complain for their $60 odd dollar steak. I requested my fiance take me back another time to try the filet to really judge this place :)  Post dinner our friend was brought out a nice piece of chocolate cake that said Happy Birthday and they even went so far to put his name. Another nice touch. The cake was super rich and I was stuffed so one bite was enough.  While the food service and ambiance was really good they lost 1/2 a star for the overly fatty steak and another 1/2 star for a very strong sewer smell upon our exit. Yes thats probably super picky but everything else had been perfect so it left a tiny bit of a bad impression upon exiting.   Overall Id be excited to come back to this place and try a filet and maybe some other kind of potatoes.',4
'My wife and I tried the new breakfast menu this morning.  We both really enjoyed it especially the Mother Lode Burrito with milk gravy and the Raspberry Bread Pudding.  I have to say they really know how to make milk gravy; most restaurants and even home cooks have no clue as to what good milk gravy is so I was impressed.  One thing they are going to struggle with a bit is that scrambled eggs will never be excellent when theyre served cafeteria style.  The same goes for potatoes.  Thats the primary reason our breakfast was very good but not exceptional.  I understand this isnt something they can really change but thought it was worth sharing the observation as eggs are key to most breakfast dishes.     Overall the new breakfast is very tasty and well concieved.  Well be back again in the near future Im sure!  BTW the 25 cent coffee is a nice throwback.  If you want a refill you just drop a quarter in the pink piggy bank on the honor system--pretty cool.',4
'Most sushi places end up with a bill with around $15-30/person depending on how much you order or where you go.  Unless you are going to be planning on eating a second dinner or drinking a lot usually you need more food afterwards to settle your stomach.  Mido sushi has all you can eat $20 sushi.  I have been to places like this such as Todai.  The significant difference between Mido and Todai is that they ask you what you want to order and it is freshly made.  The all you can eat also comes with a soup salad tempura edamame hot tea and ice cream (get the mango has a few chunks of real mango).  I didnt waste too much space other than the sushi and that is what I recommend if you want to get a bang for your buck.  I think between the 4 of us we ordered around 25 rolls of sushi.  As much as the sushi was excellent the service is a hit or miss depending on the mood of the servers.  I think last night was a good night but I have heard they can be crabs.  I also heard they actually ask you why you dont tip at least 15%.  In my opinion even though tip is very standardized I still feel you have to earn your tip.  My standard is 20% for far exceeding service 15% for great service and 12% for average service 10% or sometimes less for poor service.  When we entered they had a disco ball and some music playing for someones birthday.  They should have had the Celebration theme song after the amount of sushi we chowed down!',4
'Love how they made the place with later hours.. the bulgogi and kimchi tofu soup is very tasty and packed with flavor... The atmosphere of the resto is very clean and chill. Ill for sure be going back. Very good Korean restaurant!!!',4
'Great food casual atmosphere. The staff was very friendly. I will definitely return the next time I am in town.',4
'best selection of glasses i have found with a great return policy! I have been a returning customer for quite a while now and will not shop anywhere else.',4
'Didnt start off so well (they forgot my friend and my order)...so they compt our meal which we didnt expect cuz it was no big deal.  Atomosphere is great burger is great...will definitly go back well runned restaurant and friendly.',5
'5 stars usually isnt my thing to do but this is THE barbecue place.  All the things I want from great bbq: -tender meatiness -tasty not too sweet not too smoky bbq sauce -beyond delicious sides -good bread -no bougie prices -friendly attentive service  Well I have found all of this in Town Talk II.  Had the:  RIBS = meaty tender peppery cantquitedeterminewhatthattasteis but very delicious bbq sauce at a decent price.  WHEAT BREAD = fluffy decent 2 slices that came with the ribs.  RED BEANS & RICE = Perfectly seasoned not beyond salty or overwhelming like some red beans and rice.  loved this.  CREOLE FRIES = perfection of fries since they were lightly dusted with seasoning and salt.  CREOLE STYLE POTATO SALAD = Mustard potato salad had the perfect fluffy mayonnaisy mustard ratio.  The potatoes were much firmer than others but I really like that the were because I hate it when potato in potato salad is too soft and mushy.  It also went omg so perfectly with the ribs.  COLESLAW = Slightly sweet slightly sour all good.  They gave me a free sample when I asked if it leaned toward sweet.    BLACKBERRY COBBLER = not overly sweet like most cobblers Ive had...seedy and blackberryish flavors were oozing all over the place with lotsa good crust to make every bite equal crust to filling.  This is THE place for bbq...get there...enough said PERIOD',5
'In the search for places to eat near work I stopped in for lunch last week.    I had the small pizza/salad special for $8 or so which is a little pricey for a special (it would be more special if the drink were included).  I had their pizza of the day a BBQ chicken pizza.  It was great!  The Caesar Salad was good too though it was stacked rather high on a small plate so lettuce was jumping overboard left and right.  Maybe Im just a sloppy eater.  Overall a little more than I care to spend for a workday lunch but good eats nonetheless!',4
'Was in Az visiting from Cali last week. when I decided to check out yelp for some good eats. Thank you fellow yelpers. Cause this place is SO good I ordered the avocado club burger and some fried pickles Delish! pickles were on the oily side but still good my mom ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries and my sister ordered a chicken sandwich with the smash fries all were very good and next time Im in town I will definately be back for a burger!',5
'The chicken wings are pretty good but they are very small.  But when they are as cheap as they are I guess you get what you pay for.  Overall you can do a whole lot worse at a chicken wing joint.',3
'The map makes it difficult to tell but this is almost certainly the main Starbucks at the Desert Ridge Mall.  As it happens there is also a Starbucks inside the Albertsons at one end of the mall and there are Starbucks beverages to be found inside the Barnes & Noble but the proper Starbucks is easily found toward the movie theater end of the place.  That said the place is fine.  Its small and slightly cramped but if you go to that mall during the day when the crowds are small then its a decent little spot.  Given that its located in the food-court-like area of the outdoor mall the seating possibilities are vast even though the interior is a bit cramped.  The people were always nice as usual.  A cold Starbucks bev on a hot Phoenix summer day was not a bad way to go.',4
'I am beyond excited about this new discovery! I discovered this place last week and plan to go for the 3rd time already tomorrow. I am excited to be a regular here at this locally owned business. They are the definition of a 5 star spot! They go above and beyond with all that they do. The wine selection is good and very diverse. They even offer my FAVORITE red wine Apothic which Ive never seen in a wine bar before. They also have fabulous made in-house red and white sangrias. The spinach artichoke dip is the best Ive ever had! And believe me when I say Ive had my fair share of spinach artichoke dips. The atmosphere is exactly what I look for in a wine bar. I cannot wait until the weather cools down so I can spend more time on the amazing patio. Ive only peeked but I can tell I will be in love in a few months from now. The service here is just as impressive! The bartender Amy is so cute and such a sweetheart! She it also meticulous when she shines all of those glasses. Looks like a lot of work but she handles it with ease. This place is at the top of my list. I better be careful or I will be a wino in no time!!',5
'I love this convention center! This was the third year I was here for Phoenix Comic Con. It is clean the staff are friendly and the location is very convenient right off the light rail stop 3rd Street/Washington or 3rd Street/Jefferson depending on the direction youre coming from. I know people complain that if they drive in they have to pay for parking but I also know that while one nearby garage charges $12 another close by charges $6- so if you really want to save some money just drive around the block. Both those garages are a very quick walk away.',4
'Was waiting at the deli watching 8 PEOPLE  talking and preparing-food while I waited for over 5 minutes with no one else in line. This has now happened multiple times.  Very poor customer service. Plus all I see the management team doing on the floor is looking at their personal cell phones. Bad example of good business practices they should be ashamed.....',1
'This is my weekend Brunch spot! One word... PANCAKES!!!!',5
'I just recently took up archery after a 21 year hiatus. Like any sport the equipment had changed dramatically. I went to the sportsmans expo and was greeted by one of the Arizona Archery Clubs representative. I was curious and started to inquire about the equipment and a place to shoot. One week later Im in the range with my new bow shooting as a new member of this club.  This is a one of Arizonas biggest archery secret. The owners made me feel at home and the staff always wants to help with any concerns. Im a 20 year retired veteran and was given a discount on my membership. I would have gladly paid the full membership to be part of this organisation. Everyone is eager to help and willing to make sure that you are well taken care of. Its this kind of service coupled with a great facility that will make this club the best place to shoot in Arizona. If you have never picked up a bow or are a seasoned archer there is no other place that will make you feel at home. I get nothing for this review other than the satisfaction of sharing my experience with others.',5
'Went with a big group of med students after they took boards. The staff was accommodating if a little flaky when dividing up orders but the drink choices were good albeit pricey. The place was loud and busy for just opening up. I just tried the House Special pizza and it was good. Overall no complaints to going back.',3
'So since moving to Bend OR Ive become even more of an insufferable food snob than before. Coming back to Phoenix for a couple of weeks did not exactly excite my palate except to see Silvana and get my fix of the worlds most amazing churros. But alas I digress...  My memories over a year old now of Gallo Blanco are fond. On a lark we decided to head there for dinner last Thursday and as we got closer my mouth started watering just thinking about the luscious fruity sangria. To start we had the chorizo/queso fundito and the guacamole. The guac was AMAZING - so amazing I swear they get their avocados from Mexico: the flavor was deep full bodied and sensuous. For my entree I got three tacos: veggie halibut and shrimp. The veggie & shrimp were excellent but the halibut was not: a bit strong smelling with a taste that did not please. Not sure what was up with that as it was a strong contrast in quality from the other two. My husband loved the chilaquiles and most definitely his margarita: he is usually not pleased with the first margarita that he orders anywhere except Zydeco (in Bend) but GB came through. My stepdaughter had the carne asada burrito and intended to finish it except her dad kept making goo goo eyes at it and murmuring something about breakfast....  Im going to refrain from commenting on the sangria for now except to say I had two...We are headed back to GB for dinner tonight and Im going to road test the sangria and guac to make sure Im not just fantasizing about finding amazing whole food in Phoenix anywhere else but Silvanas kitchen.',4
'Love this place with all my heart.  If you are tired of the typical Asian cuisine step outside of your comfort zone (sushi pho and Thai) and give this place a shot.  Clean great service and healthy food.',4
'I was recently introduced to the art of Bonsai from my brother in law.  I have been researching how to Bonsai small plants and train them but most everything I have seen says I need a special mix of soil. I have my own compost and sand but needed pumice and gravel. Most garden places I have looked at either have huge bags or no clue what Im looking for. I looked online and found a Bonsai club that listed baker nursery as having Bonsai supplies. When we got there we loved how large the nursery was. They had a very large selection of plants and almost every kind of garden decoration you can think of. We kept looking through all the plants & thinking where we can put each one in our yard & garden. They had almost anything you can think of & a few things i had never seen before. It is rose season & the selection & colors of roses made me wish i had won the lotto so i could drop it all on flowers!  I had heard though that they had a collection of Bonsai on display in the nursery & when we found it I was amazed! They were georgeous! It is truley amazing that something that small can look so majestic! We did end up finding a small bag of pebbles & a small bag of Pumice which was exctly what we needed. We even bought a decoration for my new Bonsai. And of course my husband could not resist some plants either so we got a few small things for him to put around the yard. When we had a good look around & were checking out we asked if there was anyone there that really knew a lot about Bonsai plants & care so we can ask a few questions. They told us they would page Charlie over for us. Let me tell you Charlie was great to talk to. I was a little shy at first because I am not starting with a traditional plant but am trying to Bonsai a Gardenia but Charlie told me it was great that I was trying it out on something so pretty. He walked us around & even showed us a few plants that he is personally working on. He assured us that what we were planning on doing was right on track and the nutrients we had to feed the plants with would be great! I ended up buying even more Bonsai stuff from them after we talked. I will definately be back to this gem of a nursery. It was worth the drive!',5
'Ok not the cleanest place ever but it is Phoenix. Still lots of party supplies costumes and the quirky unexpected things that you cant find anywhere else. Pretty organized inside. They have areas arranged by them so it makes stuff easy to find. I went there for a Mardi Gras party and they had plenty of decorations beads etc. I have found noisemakers for NYE and even novelty items. The staff is helpful when you are looking for something specific. They seem to enjoy the fun atmosphere and are friendly. Its a big place and its been there a long time! I guess if you need to find fun stuff you know where to go!',4
'A great little place.  I always get the Gyros value meal and have them add feta cheese to the gyro ($1 extra).  The meal comes with great fries and an overloaded pita with Kronos branded meet off of their vertical broiler.  Im pretty sure its the lamb/beef original recipe.  Kronos is something Ive looked for after moving to the Scottsdale area and this was the first place I found it.  The owner is extremely friendly and willing to strike up a conversation.  Ive had nothing but pleasant interactions and experiences at this restaurant.',5
'Pretentious but not because the food or setting is above average. Some of the most plain bland chicken sandwiches and fish tacos Ive ever tasted.  It is very bland overpriced medium/small portions.   The botanical garden is pretty cool and this place came highly referred as a romantic great lunch spot but did not deliver.  It is not worth your time plan on eating somewhere else after. Unless you like bland overpriced food and the convenience of being at the garden already.',2
'Great food - great service.  Love the new Asada lunch - my new fav!!',5
'Beware: this place is EXPENSIVE. I went in with my fiancee didnt get anything as I was happy with a little sample cup but he didnt even fill his cup up and only added sprinkles and it came up to $5.15! That could buy us two pints at the grocery store! It was good but the price will be keeping me away.',3
'I wanted to really love this place but I could only like it. The service was spectacular. They messed up our order and admitted the problem up front and worked hard to make it right. Our server was the best ever...I dont remember his name but he has been referenced on here. The food was creative but the flavors didnt really come together. The food is a two but the ambiance and service a four.',3
'I enjoy a soy misto.... but I feel like it how much I enjoy it depends on who is making it.... This Starbucks is pretty hit & miss with their baristas! Not everyone can be a barista... Theres a guy that works at this location & he should be making the drinks every time because they always turnout out PERFECT.... I know by whos making the drink if it is going to be good or not... At at $4+ a drink it sucks if its not good..... Come on Starbucks... figure.... it..... out!',2
'Very nice. Stopped in for dinner on a busy Friday night and we had a great time. The almond margarita is really excellent with an unusual flavor and delicious taste. The vegetable flatbread is relatively healthy and light - good option if youre avoiding meat. The French onion burger is really tender and delicious and I liked the thick cut fries that came with it. The pork chile verde is spicy and yummy with a great cornbread on the side. The chicken salad sandwich is good but Im not sure if its worth getting again. The other menu items are so good and promising that i think the chicken salad sandwich is a little too boring in comparison.  The service was a little slow and I thought the seating was a bit crowded. Overall very nice. Id go back (especially for happy hour).',4
'Dr Sosinsky the best! Has helped me soooo much with my MS. Thank You!',5
'Cant imagine why this great place has only three stars!  Two of us shared an Italian Chopped Salad and it was delicious.  One of the best I have ever eaten.  Service was very good - price was more than reasonable.    We will be back!!',4
'Hubby ate her twice over the Labor Day holiday weekend while visiting Scottsdale.   The decor looks like a modern take on an old school diner.   This place is crowded all of the time. Our first visit we had to wait about 15 minutes before we were seated which was not bad. Our second visit we were seated right away.   On our first visit I ordered 2 chicken wings 1 waffle and lemonade. Hubby had 1 chicken breast 1 or 2 waffles (cant remember) french fries (he cant resist them) and sweetened iced tea.   OK first off this place serves their drinks in 32 ounce mason jars. The drinks are huge! They even allow free refills on drinks.   The menu said the lemonade is homemade but was watery. My husbands iced tea was better but I prefer lemon juice in my tea.   The food finally came out and the chicken was hot and tasty BUT......the waffle was cold thin and as one other reviewer described it wimpy! The flavor of the waffle was good but it was cold. My husband said his was cold too! His french fries were also cold and he sent them back.   Obviously the cook on that day was bit off on his timing of everything.   Our first visit the service was just okay. Not good but okay. It was a bit slow.   On our second visit we both ordered the soul food platter which came with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 sides.   I had collard greens and mac and cheese as my sides and he had collard greens and red beans and rice.   On the second visit my chicken breast was was over cooked and dry but everything else was pretty good. There were no complaints from my husband who had a very large juicy chicken breast on his plate.   The soul food platter also came with corn bread that had so much butter on top that it looked as though an ice cream scoop had been used. The waiter was nice enough to bring me another plate so that we could remove some of the butter.   I knew I was not going to be able to eat a whole soul food platter but there is no other combination on the menu that gives you chicken and the sides without having a waffle which I found a little odd. It did take 3 meals for me to finally eat all of this food.   Lo-Los also has fish breakfast items ad desserts on the menu. We did not have the opportunity to try them but while were there we saw that other people had ordered them and they looked pretty good too.   Let me not forget there are also various flavors of kool aid on this menu.   After speaking with some of the locals about the waffles at this place they told me to always make sure that I tell them that I want the waffle hot!   I thanked them for the tip but I wouldnt have guessed that I needed to specify that I wanted a hot dish to be hot. Go figure!   I think we will go back when we are in Scottsdale again.',3
'Holy balls. In N Out does NOT disappoint! This was my first time at In N Out and it was so good we came here twice on our 4-day trip in Arizona.  Double Double Animal style is the way to go. It is the perfect mix of a study yet not too hard bun tons of crunch lettuce/tomato/pickles grilled onions are so tasty and the mix of the cheese and spread are SO GOOD.  Definitely a must try!!',5
'I went there on a Sunday night so the place was fairly dead however the staff was great and even gave us some cards to enjoy the games for 15 minutes so that we could have fun while we hung out.  It was a great vibe and it seems like it would be a cool place to hang when there are other people around.  The animal art on the wall was a little strange but it added to the eclectic nature of this great place!',4
'Had a great experience at Discount Tires in Scottsdale today. The manager Kelly was extremely patient and informative. Every staff member was attentive to every single customer. They helped me get a credit towards my bill from the manufacturer and generally went above and beyond. I would highly recommend getting your tires here they were honest and efficient.',5
'An oasis for a weary traveller. Clean great selection and a friendly staff. I travel a bunch and to find a place that isnt insanely priced has great seating AND sports packages with plenty of televisions? Awesome. Not to mention pristine public WiFi. I would literally stab my mother in the leg for good WiFi at 4 star hotels. Got a cool 14 up and 12 down. Perfect for uploading stuff which is crucial to my job. And the owner is a South Florida refugee whose wife graduated from the same high school I did. Random stuff.   Ill be coming back for sure!',5
'Papago Brewing Company not only makes decent craft beer they have the best tap selection in the Phoenix metro area BAR NONE!  Upon entering this establishment inconveniently located in the Papago strip mall you are greeted by a fat cheery monk statue and a bustling atmosphere.  This place was happening even on a Tuesday afternoon around 2pm and we struck up conversation with locals and traveling beer enthusiasts alike.    As per previous reviews Papago has an amazing selection of draught beer that rotates constantly and I believe there were at least 10 new taps (of 25 or so) within our week between visits.  They offer a variety of domestic craft beer as well as a few Belgians and lagers from Europe as well as a couple of their own brews (made off site). The beer that Papago brews was fair with the Orange Blossom being actually really good. They are easily forgiven with all the other beer they have to offer and I was especially thrilled with the Left Hand Milk Stout on nitro...word.    In addition they have a great bottle selection to enjoy on premise or you can customize a sixer for around 8 bucks to take home.    I only have two complaints one being that this excellent tap room is located in a strip mall in Phoenix...blah.  Talk about a crappy traffic-ridden atmosphere for a wonderful tasting room.  I wish I could pick this establishment up and transplant it north of Cave Creek or somewhere in the hills and add a nice sun deck for enjoying the beer outside.    The second complaint is that the beer seems to be ordered in at random with no consideration for complimenting selections.  They definitely have a variety however it seems like there were a lot of stouts in the spring with very few lighter craft beer.  However be reminded that Papago Brewing is the best tap room in all of the Phoenix metro area and if you are searching for a place to enjoy discuss and sample craft beer from all around the world look no further than Papago you shant be disappointed.',4
'This isnt a Jamaican spot. Its more like Fusion cuisine. And its good for what it is but its not what I wanted. I just wanted a plate of Jamaican food similar to what id get in a spot in Brooklyn..   This place is fancy and they do a good job at that. They fit in well with what downtown phoenix is becoming. I got the scallops it came with some spinach carrot mix. It was plated very well presentation was A1.   Ambiance is very well executed.   I think the prices are high but then again I expected the type of Jamaican spot Im used too this place isnt that but it is nice place to go out on a date. Somewhere where you would expect to pay about 40-45 dollars for dinner. I spent $13 plus tip for 2 scallops and a small veg medley and was still hungry.  In the future Ill find a hood Jamaican spot and get a full plate for $9',3
'This was the first time I had been to a Red Lobster in my life and from what I have heard they were like a seafood-centric version of Sizzler. Not in the least.. I must say I had a nice time here from the beginning to end. The server was courteous and prompt the appetizer bread was surprisingly good and the entrees were very tasty. I had the Surf and Turf expecting the steak to be sub-par. I love steak and this was excellent steak. Perfectly cooked and coupled with Lobster tails (2). I dont really dig on seafood so this is a place I wont be frequenting but I highly recommend and would gladly come back. I actually sent my regards to the chef like a dork...',4
'We dropped in last night for a snack before the Sigur Ros concert (Amazing!) and came away totally unimpressed. The waiter was extremely nice and very attentive but the food was very blah! I had the Pesto Pasta with shrimp and it was OK but not enough flavour  at all. Annie and Di shared the Lettuce wraps which were very wet and then they shared the Veggie sandwich which was also nothing to write home about. On top of it all Di was sick in the night but that is likely due to her having a Margarita. Wont be back there.',1
'Delicious and cheap- be sure to get the guacamole they make it fresh to order. I got carne Asada tacos and they were yummy. Kinda hole -in- the- wall decor.',4
'Im big on supporting local business owners to the fullest but Im also honest with my reviews.    Jesters location is tough as is since the storefront is facing an airport and next door is a motorcycle shop and a MVD registration.  However the good side is that its the only Mexican restaurant within a 1 to 2 miles radius!  Most other places around the area are sandwich and burger shops.  The shop itself is very new -- matter of fact; think I was their first Yelper.  The decor to me is kind of cheesy with a Jester mascot in a jeep baja and the walls were splashed with some comical quotes of the day.  Needless to say I wasnt here for that.  I ordered the 2 taco combo; my buddies ordered the cheese quesadilla and a beef burrito.  Fresh ingredients and made to your order thats a plus in my opinion. However my corn tortilla tacos were okay.  I thought overall it was pretty plain.  I had a beef and pork taco and there were no seasoning or spice except topped with your choice of sides.  I just had the pico de gallo lettuce and hot sauce.  Truthfully the sauce was mild at best.  Nothing really popped on my plate.  My buddies thought their dishes were excellent.  I was told the burrito was real tasty and the cheese quesadilla was awesome!  Needless to say Im the one telling the story - wink!    Service is real relaxed and inviting.  I think the owners of the place worked hard to get this place up and running.  Their welcoming and position attitude is much appreciated! - Enjoy!',3
'This place is great and very easy to deal with they have good prices too. i have been here 3 times to buy silver coins. thanks',4
'Just got their gyro combo and their hommus. Gyro was HUGE meat was decent...had a couple pretty dry pieces but overall good. Hommus was different but very good. Personally Im excited to try out more of the menu I could see myself grabbing a bite to eat once or twice a month here.',4
'I love this place.  Everything I have had from Chloes has been great.  Great pizza for a great price and their sandwiches are excellent too.  Quick service plenty of seating nice people... It is one of the better places to grab a bite downtown and more affordable for the quality too!',5
'Talk about a disappointment. Restaurant week is something that my close group of friends looks forward to every year. Its a great time to experience something special from a restaurant we have not tried before. Our expectations were high are that the food and service would be impeccable since Restaurant Week is a showcase for creativity. Unfortunately it was not the case this year. We had a reservation for 10 for Saturday evening. We were promptly seated at a long comfortable table. However things went down from there. First off there were wine substitutions for the meal pairings. The pairing ($10 additional or $5 a glass) was a bargain but the replacement wines did not match well with the food. The appetizers were a disappointment across the board. I heard negative comments about the ceviche and the corn chowder. I had the goat cheese fondue along with several others (with high praise from the server).  We all commented on its unpleasant non-fondue-like texture and the tasteless crackers that accompanied it. The entrees fared no better. The salmon was overcooked the tortellini was bland and the skirt steak was tough and not very favorable as skirt steaks usually are. The worst thing (noted by several others) was an artichoke and leek gratin. It was thick and dry as spackle and the worst item of the night. Nothing came out at the proper temperature. Dessert was an afterthought with a mini sampling of mediocre selections placed on a plate with no flair whatsoever. Though we enjoyed each others company we were completely disappointed at this subpar experience. Most said they would not come back based on this experience.',2

'I almost gave Sushi Eye 4 stars but there were a few things holding me back. This may be a bit petty but the hostess brings us back to seat us (just my wife and I) and she sits us at a table in the center of the room when there are better seats against the wall not out in front of everyone. It was a Saturday night but not crowded at all. As for the food my wife ordered the yellowtail and tuna sushi and the eel roll which was fresh and tasty. I ordered several rolls which were tasty but nothing to rave about. The drinks we ordered were ok but again nothing to rave about. The decor and mood of Sushi Eye were nice and we felt very comfortable. Overall we were hoping for better tastes but it was just ok. Not bad but not great. They need to pick it up a notch to compete with either Ra or Stingray.',3
'I had to stop in here the other day to check on a book and I enjoyed checking out all the ASU gear they have. They have a large selection and very reasonably priced. I may need to buy a few items since I am now an ASU coed.  I highly recommend picking up the various student coupon books on campus. I dont recall which book this store has a few coupon in but it is in one of them.  I still think it is cheaper to get books online but for all your other ASU needs I highly recommend. The staff is super nice and helpful!  Oh and as a nice bonus...when I checked out they gave me a free daily planner. Not that I actually use a paper calendar anymore but it was nice anyhow. I will give it to my mom! =)',4
'I wasnt here long but the drinks were good and the bartenders are HOTT.  I thought it was cool that they have dancers and a mechanical bull (even though it wasnt running).  The balcony overlooks the marketplace which is pretty cool.  Would love to come back and spend more time.',3
'We stopped in here on a hot summer afternoon grumpy because we had been on a wild goose chase for mint. Couldnt find it anywhere like Frys Bashas or TJs even in those teeny tiny overpriced little packages. They have it here in big bunches for something ridiculous like 59 cents. Since we had friends coming over for mojitos this made me happy! Its just about mojito season again so Ill be headed back to this location. The produce section was large and had some good-looking stuff in it. The location isnt really too scary.',4
'Delish but overpriced for a burger joint.',3
'YES! Grab your nom nom face and head on over!  Experience: I looked this place up on yelp since I knew Id be in the area. My wife and I went in and the place was packed no tables. We were ordering and one opened up my wife quickly snagged it and after I sat down the guy came over and wiped it down for us.  Food: Food took a little bit to be done but they were crazy busy in store and phone orders. The food was amazing! I got steak shawarma and my wife got a fish wrap and baklava. I cannot wait to go back I neeeed it. For the record Id had gyros/wraps before.. first time with shawarma. I asked the guy taking orders what he recommended and went along with it. I want to explore the whole menu.',5
'Looks like this meal may be the best of our trip to the west. Service was excellent though I noted a full bus of people that came in before we left. That might have given the second seating some issues. But we were unscathed.     We did the chopped salad and it was good and creative. Creative is what best describes the fare. The pork belly rocked and the mushroom fry was nice though a meal size would be too much. Jeff had had hamburger and whaoo! It was a 10 or close. A contender to Poag Mahone in Chicago!      We guilded the lilly with zeppoli and they were awesome like mini Leonards malasdas from Hawaii. Sweet!',5
'* sigh of relief *   THERE IS AUTHENTIC ASIAN FOOD IN THE VALLEY!  great service good pho. the broth wasnt oily nor watered down. average pricing for a bowl of pho (8.25 for the special).  also ordered hieu tieu nam vang my favorite soup dish. however it wasnt so great here; broth was bland large serving.  salad rolls and peanut sauce are just like any other place nothing special nor bad.   I LOOOOOOOOVED that they had disposable chopsticks and sauce dishes. very clean and inviting setting.',4
'3 stars... I really wanted to give more stars but the food was just ok and the strip mall location doesnt add anything to the experience either.    I went to dinner here the other night with my boyfriend on HIS SUGGESTION.  Since I had never been before I was up for the new adventure.  I like that it is just a casual little place and the pictures of Greece on the walls had me thinking it may impress me.  Unfortunately not the case.  I will say that our waitress Anna was really sweet and knowledgeable.  You could tell shes been working there for years.  We started with the red lentil soup which was delicious and Anna brought us a taste of the spinach curry soup as well - it was spicy but tasty and had me excited for what was to come.  We went with the Sleepy Gyro Salad and the Vegetarian Plate II which was more than enough food for us to share.  Too bad none of it was that great.  The vegetarian plate came with hummus baba falafel dolmas tabbouleh spanikopita and yogurt sauce for $12.45.  Not such a deal.  The hummus is better at Pita Jungle the baba ghannouj was ok but really smokey the falafel just eh the dolmas and tabbouleh both mediocre and the spanikopita was dry instead of moist and flaky...  The sleepy gyro salad is filled with too many onions and has a ridiculous amount of garlic... If you like onions garlic and gyro though this is a good deal at $8.55!  Sorry Sabas - even though Anna was a great waitress I will not be coming back to visit you anytime soon... instead Ill be on the hunt for Greek / Middle Eastern Cuisine that compares to that I grew up with in Detroit!',3
'This place can suck my balls. I was excited to have a neighborhood bar with live music (even if it is country). I went and after 2 beers was kicked out with no explanation. I didnt even pay for my drinks. Weirdos.',1
'This was my first time at Cafe Boa and I happened upon it while looking for a late morning breakfast place. Bread brought out with the meal was hard and dry. No butter or jam was offered. We had to ask for it.   One of my big pet peeves: memorizing orders. Id rather you write it down than try to impress me when you eventually screw it up. Of course our server did. He forgot our orange juice and I had to ask for it. I was really in the mood for what was advertised on the menu as Fresh Squeezed OJ. A large glass of OJ was brought to the table but if it was Tropicana theyd be doing at least better than they were. It wasnt fresh squeezed. I asked our server about it and he seemed to fumble for some feeble explanation about the bartender etc. and sounded surprised. Big mistake to be blaming others. So he finally brings back fresh squeezed and its a glass about a third the size of of the original.  The food overall was tasty and hot. No complaints there. Service seems to be on par with the other reviews. Our chucklehead was no exception. When he did bring the bill it was only a total and no itemized bill. Had to ask for that too. I wonder if hell figure out hell save himself a lot of work by doing it right the first time?',2

'If I could give zero stars I would: what is this place? A haven for craft-brew enthusiasts? A wanna-be bistro? Animal shelter activist headquarters? I dont bloody get it. 1.) it took the waitress 20 minutes to shove two tables together to accommodate our party of 8 (4 adults and 4 small kids.) The restaurant wasnt busy but the staff spent so much time drinking with the patrons they couldnt be bothered to do the necessary shoving.  2.) the waitress took order disappeared to drink and chat at the bar came back about 40 mins later with food. 3.) hubby ordered a burger no complaints. Elder kiddo ordered fish and chips and proceeded to eat only the fries (thin cut fast food fries not chips.) The fish was slightly undercooked and overly greasy-- not sure how that was accomplished. It was served with what was supposed to be slaw but was just red cabbage in an oily dressing. My kid never turns her nose up at any fish but she didnt even touch it.  I ordered the brats and mashed potatoes to share with my youngest kiddo-- the fresh veggie sauté was excellent and the mashed potatoes with bacon were fantastic...at least the few bites that werent drowned in an unpleasant bitter onion-and-beer-based reduction. The brats were also doused in the powerfully bitter gravy but no matter since they were undercooked as well. A nice steak should be pink in the middle a sausage should not be. Ick. Id have complained to the waitress but she never reappeared.... 3.) ... In fact she hadnt come back by the time I left with the kids and my hubby stayed with my friends hubby to try the horchata-orange beer the pub was unveiling that night. Who knows when she wandered back.  4.) live music too loud at 6 pm. 5.) hubby said that after my friend and I left with our respective kids our table sat un-bussed for at least an hour. Some drink guy came up and asked if he could finish off my daughters uneaten (and still uncleared away) plate of cold fish and chips then helped himself... The horror.   This place made me think of where 40-ish post-hipsters go to drink away their remaining youth... Alcohol probably kills the salmonella from all the undercooked food after all.',1
'I could not give a better recommendation than to Dr. Taylor and his staff. Not only is the office and staff warm and welcoming the service received is professional and outstanding. I had extensive work done over the past several years as did all 3 of my children. They LOVED going to AZ Associates in Dentistry. One might think a small town dentist might lack credibility however this office is FAR superior to the bigger chains we have been to while living in the PHX metropolitan area. Every time we went to XYZ Dental (not outing them out of respect) we were handed a list of suggested treatments all of which were unfortunately not covered by insurance. Just a heads up - if something is important enough generally insurance companies will cover at least part of the cost. We felt as if these other big chain dental offices were trying to make a profit by selling us everything from tooth paste to tooth brushes to whitening treatments! Dr. Taylor takes the time to get to know you as a person make suggestions give you options and most importantly TIME to think about what is feasible for you.',5
'I wasnt completely sure what to expect when I went to the Heard Museum but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed myself.  We were there for almost 2.5 hours and the time flew by.  The permanent exhibit was laid out nicely and I truly learned quite a bit that I did not know previously about Native Americans.  In fact I had no clue how many different tribes call Arizona and New Mexico home and reading the history and how they are now was quite fascinating but I am a history nerd. The Remix contemporary exhibt was well-done and was my favorite portion of the whole museum but Im a sucker for contemporary art and installations.  We even wondered about the childrens area and that was also well done with a variety of hands on crafts and activities for little peanuts (heck my husband and I even did some of them! hehe).   The boarding school exhibit on the second floor was very nicely done and well laid out...the testimonials that played while you walked around were quite touching and at times I felt myself tearing up.  Adult admission is $10 and students are only $5. My husband forgot his ASU student ID and when he mentioned it to the cashier the guy was like oh thats OK and gave us the student admission anyway. Very nice.  There were quite a few people at Heard while we were there but I never felt rushed or that I was in someones way which I think speaks highly of the layout.  I definitely recommend the museum if you have an afternoon you are looking to fill and/or just want to learn more about Native Americans.',5
'Okay in a pinch when you are absolutely craving pizza and a salad but its not so much faster that you coudnt run in somewhere else.  Maybe if you are really frazzled and need to take the kids out to a meal but dont want to disturb other people.  Cant say that the food is offensive its just not great.',3

His 2 man crew finished the job quickly and with comfortable and pleasant interaction and conversation.  Will DEFINITELY look to use Arties services again! And we scored an awesome new pen.',5

'Giant Coffee is a welcome addition to the caffeine scene in central Phoenix.  After visiting Matts Big Breakfast and The Roosevelt I knew the atmosphere at Giant would be sublime and I was right. While I had already been inside for a few Merz events and art shows it was nice to actually sit down with a book and a coffee and experience a cafe like it is meant to be.  The coffees Ive had were decent but no threat to Cartel or Royal (and there is something about importing it from a CA roasters that sits wrong with me) but at least they are making the effort to raise the bar in the central city. However decent coffee is fine with me as to me the drinks themselves are only an excuse to hang out with friends or a good book in cool place.  From the other reviewsIt sounds like I may have to give the honey vanilla latte a try... if only they had a loyalty card ;-) Although I could do without the price premium for a toddy (if anything its easier to make that a regular).    While it wont be my go to coffee joint it will be a regular stop while visiting the library or Art Museum freeing myself from the teen scene and blue hair beat crowds of  their respective cafes.  Oh and shut up already about the cash only. Its quirks like this that remind us were actually living in a city and not and endless sprawl-topia.  If you only carry cards there are plenty of Starbucks around.',4

'While I cant say I will never go back because the food WAS good; I CAN say: I will go someplace else if theres a wait because while it was at least 30 minutes before we got seated it was 45 before our food arrived.   Truly: I think it had to do with the fact that 3 very large (for the small venue and kitchen) tables were seated immediately before us but that does not excuse that fact that 45 minutes on top of a 30 minute wait is an unreasonable amout of time to go without so much as a The kitchens a little backed up right now. Thank you for your patience. Which in itself would have been an understatement.   Top that with the employees showing up with the original wait list to correct my statement that we had been there for 2 hours when I asked how much longer our food would be. It had only been an hour and a half. My bad.  Those jalapeno pecan pancakes are frickin awesome though...',2
'Great haircut! Great price too. I was on vacation and needed a quick cut. Its next to a coffee shop. The barbers are really friendly. Worth looking up!',4
'The food was just OK.  Nothing special.  It took forever to get our meal. The service was horrible.  I was asked if I wanted more coffee but I didnt get it until my food was almost gone.  The service really needs to improve.  My waitress would disappear for 20 minutes.  Oh valet parking only or street parking.  I would go back for a casual lunch or happy hour but not for special occasion.  Not good enough for that.',3
'Woohoo!  This is definitely as good as it gets for farmers market around here.  McClendon dominates with a large corner space and the long lines to prove it.  Maya farm also has a good presence.  But there were also two other small growers this morning one of which has really good looking heirloom tomatoes.    The chocolate bread fromt he Phoenician hit my sweet spot straight on.  I also really liked the tomale stand with vegan option. Next time Ill try to check out the bbq man.   Now this is something worth getting up early on a Saturday for.',5
'Thai food is one of my passions. I long ago stopped eating Chinese food entirely--bland piles of flavorless noodles and weird sticky-sweet sauces no thank you. And I dont have any use for cloying syrupy Pad Thai dishes that roll around begging for your attention like some filthy two-dollar noodley whore. I like my Thai food spicy. Thai spicy. Pink Pepper delivers and for that I dub thee the Best Thai in Phoenix.   My personal favorite dish is called Spicy Green Bean with Tofu aka Prik King. Im a vegetarian and they have a ton of veg options but not to worry carnivores theyve got your back. Unbelievably flavorful with fresh vegetables--not fresh-frozen really fresh. And spicy? They ask you to order your spiciness based on a 1-to-10 scale 10 being the surface of the sun. Not coincidentally very much like the pain scale you may find at hospitals. I order a 10 and they always ask me are you sure?--possibly for insurance purposes. So so good. If your tastes are milder theyll take care of you. Youll get less heat but no less flavor.   Ive only had the lunch buffet once--and it is a bit milder as one would expect when feeding a crowd of suburbanites. Its a great opportunity to try dishes youve never had before and if you want something stronger theyre more than happy to let you order off the menu.   The service? Well I live in California and I dont get into town that often. Ive only eaten at the Pepper maybe 10-15 times over the last few years. But every time I walk in the wait staff greets me by name and remembers what I ordered on my last visit.  Incredibly nice folks.   Atmosphere? Well its 1985 in there. I like 1985. Kind of a teal green/gray combo. Its a high end Miami Vice video type thing sans neon. Its very unique it has character and I sincerely hope they leave it the way it is. Its clean well-kept nice low-level lighting great for a first date.   To recap: stop reading this and get down there post-haste.',5
'Hey Rudy L. Take you snobby sushi eating attitude somewhere else. So what it used to be a l&l and has no bar doesnt mean the food isnt good. FYI you need to reread your review before you actually save it.   Ive been to literally 20-30 sushi places around the valley some gross and some awesome and this place is close to awesome. Yes its family owned and the daughter with a huge bun on top of her head is the waitress and the son and father make the sushi. But most of the time mom and pop shops are the best but in this case the son is the owner.   My favorite things to order are Tuna Karai Arizona roll and surf and turf. the tuna Karai is a tuna salad with octopus and its spicy but sooooo damn good. Sometimes Ill order 2 orders with some rice and make that as my meal.   Ive had a lot of other rolls to with friends and they are great. The big thing for me is presentation and the sushi looks great. Doesnt look sloppy no big and small pieces rice is tight and intact. The fish taste and smells very fresh.   They also have Korean tea. Which is basically barley tea its very good ask for it cold.   Anytime Im in the area I try to stop by and get my tuna Karai fix. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because they dont serve alcohol yet.   Keyword is yet I talk to the owner Steve a lot when Im there and hes already in the process of getting his liquor license which should be approved by may. Nothing like have some sushi and washing it down with some saki bombers.',4
'The very best food has magical properties and one of the most remarkable is the ability to instantly transport you to another place and time.  Every time I dig into my first bite of gelato at Arlecchino Gelateria I am transported back to Vivoli Gelato in Florence Italy.  Make no mistake about it.  The gelato at Arlecchino is the real deal.  Its the same gelato you get in the very best artisanal gelaterias of Italy.  The fantastic gelato at Arlecchino is the work of Moreno Spangaro a masterful small artisan producer who makes every batch from scratch.  Its no wonder that his product is so authentic.  Moreno hails from Trieste Italy and he learned his craft by apprenticing for nearly two years with Fabio Sacchetto his maestro.     Moreno understand that a phenomenal product only results from the best and freshest ingredients.  He only uses fresh organic fruits when theyre in season and at their height of ripeness.  He relies heavily upon McClendons Select for the best of the bounty that Arizona has to offer.  He doesnt overlook the non-fruit varieties either.  For example he has his own mix of different chocolates because every one has different properties that result in a complex final chocolate flavor.  You MUST taste the gelato at Arlecchino to understand how fantastic it truly is.  They offer a limited selection of only the freshest flavors each day.  You may find classics such as Coffee Nocciola Pistacchio (made from 100% pure Sicilian pistachios from Bronte Italy; it costs a few cents more per scoop and its TOTALLY worth it!) Nutella Stracciatella and seasonal fruits.  The also offer original creations such as Cortina which always reminds me of the charming Alpine village itself.  Youre really in luck if they have the Peanut Butter or Dulce de Leche when you visit.  I just had the Valentino and it was complex and amazing because its an infusion of pomegranate berries rose petals and lavender.    Moreno runs his tiny gelateria with his wife Marina.  You will often find one or both of them behind the counter.  Some might consider the decor of the shop to be a bit a minimalist but no detail is overlooked at Arlecchino.  The shop is purposely simple and elegant to avoid any distraction from the beauty of the gelato itself.  The parking around Arlecchino can be a nightmare because its next to La Grande Orange Grocery/Pizzeria and Postino is in the building behind it.  Dont despair and keep looking for a space because the gelato at this place is totally worth the extra effort.   If you want gelato come to Arlecchino for an amazing experience.  Skip the other gelato joints in town because theyre peddling pre-fab gelato bases and canned flavorings.',5
'This place was recommended by a co-worker when first moved to Phoenix.  At one point I was going there 2 times a week. Food is EXCELLENT considering the prices. Its inexpensive quick and delicious. I recommend the ASU Devil Chicken... Their stir fried veggies are good too. I have not had anything that was not good. Their crab puffs are really good. A bit on the sweet side but I am not complaining.',4
'Worst customer service worst unaccompanied minor garbage airlines. My daughter whom is 13 has been traveling unaccompanied for 2 years on other airlines as the cutoff age is 11 for Southwest United etc. At the Roanoke airport they said she could fly by herself and let her on. On the stop over they wouldnt let her on the plane unless we paid $100 but my wife said at the Roanoke airport the said she could fly alone. They made a big deal but had no choice but to let her continue the trip. On the website I kept on checking every minute on arrival status. It said she was arriving half hour late. She in fact she arrived half hour early. On the way back at Houston I went to check her in and they said that the flight had been canceled and tried to blame me for checking her in during the 24 hour check in time. I got no phone call or email despite they having phone and email information that I was required to give them. Then they said she cant fly anyway because she is under 15. So they said get a refund on the ticket. They wouldnt let her fly on Delta airline even if I paid the unaccompanied minor fee. I immediately called Southwest Air and she got on the plane no problem and no fee for unaccompanied minor and their age cutoff is 11 like most airlines. I have flown Southwest many times and she has flown Southwest many times without problems and the fare is cheaper but I couldnt get the flight in the exact location so that is why I chose US Air but never again as this has been my worst airline nightmare in my whole life. With customer service like that you would wonder how they are saving cost on maintenance of their airlines. This airline is not safe to fly from what Ive seen. I am willing to pay higher price for any other airlines that is safer and better customer service.',1
'Amazing Indian Tacos.  This place is really delicious.',5
'Great place awesome service. After spending a business trip on the east coast encountering terrible wait staff and mediocre food this place was a breath of fresh air. We came in about an hour before closing looking for food (every restaurants nightmare) on a Saturday. They sat us right away. Mike our waiter was extremely helpful. He was patient with us answered our questions made great recommendations and was very friendly. Having to work a crowded place late on a Saturday night not many people would be so nice. He even gave us a heads up to make our dessert order before the kitchen was closed. Another guy with an epic beard (sorry didnt catch his name)who wasnt our waiter was just as helpful even though he didnt have to be. Most people would have said they would try to find our actual waiter. This guy stopped what he was doing to help and he was completely genuine (and patient with my friends never ending questions). The food here is amazing also. I highly recommend the pretzel bites the turkey pastrami and my friend really liked his burger too.  They have live music on Friday and Saturday and the band on the night we went was amazing and very fitting for the atmosphere.  I hate to tell too many people about this gem because I want to keep it my little secret. But there is a lot of buzz about this place and it deserves praise.',5
'I must preface this review by saying that we had a very different expectation of what this place would be compared to what it was.  It was recommended to us by friends and was described as a cider bar.  We imagined cider tasting pub food etc.    It is much more friendly lunch spot than gastropub.  That being said the staff was extremely friendly and welcomed us like we were expected.  They currently have one cider available but are working on more.  The food was very very good.  We shared a pretzel and it was clearly fresh (I always worry about being tricked and getting a frozen Super Jumbo pretzel).  My caprese sandwich was delicious.  They had a wonderful menu of homemade sodas sundaes and floats which we didnt sample (but would like to next time).    Super friendly folks and definitely a must-do if youre in Old Town.',5
'The green curry is not so good. Its very basic and just tastes like paste mixed with coconut. I prefer when there is fresh lemongrass and thai basil in it and some spice heat and more seasoning.   However I had this soup there. Im not sure which one it is. Its closer to the bottom of the soup menu. Its served in one of the metal bowl things with the flame under it. It is red and has lots of lemon grass stalks in it and what looks like it might be galangal(?)  woody looking chips chicken (I dont even like chicken) and spicy deliciousness (thats an ingredient now). This soup is killer. I think about it all the time. If I could marry it I might. Its only $8 as well and enough for two people to share and I would go as far as to say that it would fill you up at lunch time.  Go there try this soup.   Other than that.... um the place isnt very nice but its not bad either just a casual small little restaurant. The service is good- nothing else is very memorable about it for me except that soup Good stuff.',4
'The restaurant is kind of hidden tucked back in a strip mall -- its located katty-korner across from Lee Lees Oriental supermarket.  I was dying to try it and was totally satisfied!  It is not a huge restaurant and reservations are recommended. Our appetizers were edamame and the beef tongue which was sliced very thinly and salt/pepper seasoned.  We had several rolls and nigiri and our favorite was the oyster roll.  The seafood was very fresh and well-prepared.  Id have to say it was the best sushi Ive ever eaten. Service was swift and efficient.  I highly recommend this restaurant!',5
'I think this is going to be my favorite fro-yo place.  I liked the decor and the large selection of flavors they not only had PISTACHIO but also Banana my two favorite.  Also the texture seemed to be creamier than others.   I liked that the seating is low and round so I can bring the twins without too much worry about sharp corners.',5
'My friend took us here to ask us to be her bridesmaid so it was fun that we had a nice little corner in the back with some prosecco and chocolate.   The girls who work there are very cute and fun and were happy we were having a great time. We shared a piece of cake with a sampler of some dark chocolates. From my others reviews you can tell I am girl who likes a good bang for her buck and to me the chocolate size wasnt worth the cash we paid for it. The cake on the other hand was huge and delicious.   I probably would never go here again because its not up my alley but it was good to be invited and to try something new.',4

And the food was really really good.  Nothing from a can.  Salsa was dam*ed amazing!  Big chunks of meat in his meal.  No skimping on anything from them.  I hope the good folks at Mi Patio get more 5 star ratings because they deserve it.  4 stars isnt enough.',5

'During a visit to Scottsdale last month we joined the few the proud the happy diners who have had a chance to experience Cafe Monarch!   (Apologies to the USMC for co-opting their recruiting slogan in the above.)   This venture is truly a labor of love for chef / owner Christopher whose passion for his endeavor shows through in every detail from the ambiance to the food to the service.   Arriving a little early for our 6 pm reservations on a Thursday night we had a chance to speak with a couple of Christophers friends who had dropped by to see him and learned that he created the wondrous space of Cafe Monarch out of what was formerly a beauty salon. In fact Christopher shared that earlier that week and perhaps even earlier that day he had been working to replace an interior door and make some other changes. A never ending adventure of putting the stamp of character on Cafe Monarch.   Normally we might start a review with a discussion of the food we enjoyed but the Cafe Monarch experience is so much centric to the persona of the owner that it might be best to start there.   Christopher is a charming man with a convivial style and it doesnt hurt that he is pretty darned delightful to look at as well! Plus he is a talented chef and does all the menu planning shopping and cooking. No assistants or sous chef here. (In discussion with him we learned we can thank his mom for his great cooking skills...in that he needed to learn to cook for self preservation!)   He is also an accomplished host who serves the meals and circulates during the evening to make certain that his guests whether dining inside or outside have what they need.   On the evening we arrived there was pecan wood burning in two outdoor free standing fireplaces offering a wonderful aroma and which would provide warmth of temperature and ambiance both for those who arrived and elected to dine outside as the evening evolved. We chose to sit inside where we could soak up the eclectic charm of the restaurant and enjoy watching Christopher at his craft in the kitchen. A nice couple from Washington state came in and sat alongside us and in enjoying an evening of delightful conversation with them we all marveled at Christopher in action.   Our dinner that evening started with a salmon appetizer that included thick (poached?) nuggets of the flavorful fish served with a slice of grilled eggplant (unique combination and worked so well) along with a wonderfully flavorful fresh herb pesto capers and a slice of good grilled crostini. We all agreed it was so Delicious and the serving size so generous we could have stopped there and been happy. But there was more to come in a choice of two entree selections one was slices of pork (loin?) served with a fresh mango salsa and citrus sauce and the other chicken paillard served on a bed of creamy polenta with cheese and surrounded by a lovely pool of tomato sauce. All of the seasonings were just right as was the temperature of the food at service. We finished the meal with a baked Bosc pear topped with wonderful warm chocolate sauce and puff pastry dusted with confectioners sugar.   Ahhhhh.....yummmmm.   As others have shared there is no liquor license here so youll have a chance to bring your own bottle of wine (we love being able to do that and to be able to share it as we could on this eveningwith the couple next to us.) Bring cash as our understanding is Christopher does not take plastic. To plan for the cash well share that our dinner that evening that we think included a $10 fee for corkage was $98 or so including tax for two people.   On our next visit to Scottsdale we hope to be able to have lunch at Cafe Monarch and sit outside to enjoy Christophers hospitality and great food again.   A closing note for this review is to mention accessibility. We have a heightened awareness of that issue of late and also note that the NY Times has included accessibility comments for some time in their reviewswith a renewed focus after food critic Frank Bruni had a favorite dining companion start to use a wheelchair. While Cafe Monarch is on one level there is a step up to the restaurant all inside seating is at bar height chairs and the bathroom is not accessible for wheelchairs. As we enjoyed our evening at Cafe Monarch we thought of two friends who would love it one an attorney and another an artist and gallery owner but who use wheelchairs and would need to know in advance that although the Yelp tag says wheelchair accessible: yes the access here is limited.',4
'I wish I wasnt such a cheapskate! I should realize by now that sometimes you are paying for quality and it is worth it!  Its not that Tammie Coe is insanely priced or anything like that Im just not tooootally used to paying $5 for one piece of cake anywhere.  That said the piece of cake I bought the coconut lime was yummy in flavor! The texture was sliiightly rougher than Im used to and the piece smaller than Id want for 5 bucks. But I mean... I inhaled it all that day so obviously I wasnt using too much of my time complaining!  My friends got the black forest cupcakes something else I forget and banana blueberry(? i think) bread. I got to try the bread & I have to say... deelectamable! That was tastyriffic to the max! And word from the friends is they enjoyed the other things they bought as well. Thanks Tammie Coe!',4
'This one will be easy its a puff piece.  I showed up one day at lunch time I dont know when I dont even know how I ended up here its really hard to find although the yelp app makes digging for mom-and-pop-shop gold real easy. Privately owned Two Hippies is a concept you can buy and basically do whatever you want with it. Im so happy they decided to pass around these beautiful gnarly burger joints.   When I got back to work I was very excited that I chose this over Armandos Mexican which is not bad btw anyways this burger was definitely Gnarly. It was juicy and plump filled with ingredients and flavor and still hot when I got back. I normally finish my burgers and fries because normally there is no burger challenge my stomach cant handle. That being said this burger kicked my ass I did not complete this challenge. That will be the only failure I write in this review and this will be my vow to avenge my honor I will be back for more.  Ill leave you with this Its one of those burgers where the second you pick it up you know your taste buds are about to party. Taking the first bite your toes start to curl and your tongue begins to salivate applauding your brain for eating it. Your then euphoric  brain says Riiight on bro. It was that good. I went in sober came out high on Gnar and extremely addicted to burger joints.',5
'Enjoyed the food and liked the fact that there are smaller sharing plates.  We got the Ciao Mixed Greens (spring tomato white balsamic pesto buttermilk mustard vinaigrette) which was solid.  The Cheeks & Beans had really tender beef cheek meat and the Burrata Bonanza (with avocado arugula radish fried shallots) was good as well.   One of the signature dishes they had was the Mushroom Pan Fry.  We got the mini version and I really enjoyed the sauce it came in.  Its a bit of a misnomer since whenever I see pan fry I think of stir fry but this dish was definitely not a stir fry.  The sauce was thick and creamy and had sort of a tomato base.  Would be good to eat with bread or something.  Liked the decor as well.  Id consider coming back if I was in the area again.',4
'I have never been treated so rudely by a fellow group of native americans. Makes me regret the time and effort I spent trying to help these greedy tribes gain this power that they now so blatantly abuse. It also makes me rethink the whole legality of it. These apples have red skin but a white core.',1
'The atmosphere was a little different from what we expected.  It is much more relaxing and casual than the ones weve been to in L.A.  The waiter was very polite and funny at the same time.  He seemed relieved and excited to serve our table since we were the only under 50 table in the whole restaurant.  *Steaks = very yummy.  cooked to perfection.   *Decor = a little on the vintage side *Service = wonderful',4
'What a beautiful place to sit with friends around the fire and enjoy some wine and food!  The fish fish tacos got the group vote for the fav HH food.  The crab cake cake was tiny and not impressive.  Whereas the cheese plate was more savory with a little something for everyone.  If you are looking for a patio setting then you cant go wrong here.',4
'Walking into this place I immediately knew it was a top notch 5 star liquor store. They have prices cheaper than grocery stores! For example 3 olive vodka is only $14.99. They also offer 10% off if you buy 6 or more bottles of wine or liquor and you can mix and match!   The selection here is seriously amazing. No joke Ive never seen such a selection of both wine beer and liquor. I saw a bottle of vodka that was shaped like a shotgun with a strap and all! They also rate their wine like high end wine stores do which always makes shopping for wine more fun.   Best of all the employees and customers we all so friendly. I left there with a smile on my face and a couple of bottles of wine to enjoy. I even wrote this review before I opened a bottle. Now THAT is impressive!',5
'I will agree with the first two posts. I have been here a handful of times and food is always amazing',5
'I go to this Applebees for Happy Hour... I have gone for dinner but Happy Hour is definitely my pull.  Either way its average... its Applebees.  We tend to sit at the bar but well go out of our way to sit in Brandys section if shes not bar tending!  Brandy is the reason we choose this Applebees for Happy Hour over some of the many other choices around town.',3
'Aunt Chiladas combines festive decor and loud Mariachi music with pretty standard Mexican fare. The entrees were large and reasonably priced. I did enjoy my smoked pork chinalinga and the choice of salsas -- verde or roja in mild medium or hot.. But still the pluses arent enough to drive out of your way for a visit.   Another note: it did seem like the place to go if you are into drinking a lot (which I am not) so keep that in mind if youre looking more for a place to bring the kiddies or your 80-year-old aunt Rose.',3
'Follow up review- still awesome!!  amazing pizza and salad amazing boutique beers - what else need be said!!!',5
'What is a winesky?   Im so very glad that you asked. A winesky is a cocktail containing the happy marriage between Coach Houses finest cabernet and whisky from the deepest well in all of  Scottsdale. Conceived from the mind of my favorite genius bartender Drew a winesky is an all out assault on your senses and if you have one too many of them you will surely be ass-over-tea-kettle in no time flat.  Coach house is the best bar in Scottsdale. Hands down. (DJs was a close second) I generally come here with Rabbi Andrew Michael Doohan III. If it is a proper night we will stroll in sideways at 12:00 am on the dot and our standard order is two shots of whisky and a pitcher of Bud Light. Often if Drew is working he will line our order up as soon as the Rabbi and I walk in the door. He knows us a little too well perhaps.   $13 for the first round. Well shots(including wineskys) are generally $3.50. Full pitchers are $6 or $6.50(domestic of course).  I love the other bartenders too although some of them overcharge on occasion and they dont necessarily get my jokes.....  Christmas lights from November-February. Free Barbecue every Giants home game during Spring Training and almost every Sunday for the rest of the year.',5
'Awesome staff and great prices. Free paraffin wax with the pedicure is amazing!!',5
'Since Ive always been a huge fan of Popeye and Olive Oil its no wonder I was drawn to this place... :)  Thanks to Robert Ms review I checked out QCOMs website and ordered a holiday gift for an out-of-state friend... the process was simple as can be and I felt safe using my credit card on their secure site.    I received confirmation via email a few seconds after the transaction went through... I hope my friend enjoys her Arizona made gift and I look forward to visiting Queen Creek Olive Mill sometime in person.  Im sure it will be a fun little field trip!',4
'I shop here all the time since I live close by. I have already written a review for this home depot. Now I need to contact yelp find out what is happening to my reviews.  Depending on what time of day you shop here you will always be lucky enough to find day laborers loitering at the entrance. Youll know your shopping experience is complete when you return to your car to find someone begging for spare change to catch the bus.',4
'Friendly staff great atmosphere and adequate food.  Plus cider and Guiness on tap!',4
'Teds is the best it really is. Charcoal cooked hot dogs awesome onion rings and loganberry. Whats not to love?',5
'Good food and atmosphere... The quaca is pretty tasty and has a good flavor. My partner and I each had an Vampiro and shared a Trio. Very fulfilling and for $20 a great price. Wish we could have gotten a refill on the chips but hey it was still good food.',5
'In exchange for watching our little one my in-laws proposed that we meet up at Crackers & Co to make the switch. A new breakfast place AND we get a date day? Im game!  When we first arrived I was a little skeptical. The Cafe is located in a little strip mall behind the Home Depot right next to a cabinet place. But Im learning to be adventurous so I decided to not judge this place by its surroundings. Wise decision!  We showed up during what I thought would be prime brunch time on a Sunday morning. Surprisingly there was absolutely no wait. We were ushered to our table by the hostess where we were greeted by arguably the most cheerful interactive and helpful waitress Ive ever encountered. Thank you Luana.  We looked over the menu for a few minutes it didnt really take us long to figure out what we wanted. My daughter got the kids pancakes and my wife and I each ordered the Healthy Scram.  For the so called kids portion of pancakes my daughter received three full grown pancakes. Of course she couldnt finish them. If she had I imagine she would have been in a coma for the next two days.  As for my wifes and my meal...absolutely delicious. We each opted to have two extra egg whites scrambled in with our orders. Essentially it ends up being an oversized egg white omelette. Couple that with a cup of fresh fruit and a dry English muffin and youve got yourself an amazingly healthy and filling breakfast/brunch/dinner... whenever you decide to eat it I assure you it will be delicious.  The three of us ended up spending about $40 for our meals. The price is a little bit inflated though as it does cost $1.00 extra per egg white added to our omelettes. But whatever. you pay for what you get...and we got an awesome meal!  If youre looking for a cozy breakfast place with a great menu with healthy options awesome atmosphere a patio and (in our case) the greatest service weve experienced in QUITE some time then you should definitely stop by!',5
'Stayed here for a long weekend.   Reserved a standard room with a king size bed. Check in was quick and painless. However was given keys to a room with two double beds. Was told that all reservations made through third parties are automatically given a room w/ two doubles.....was ultimately given a room with a king bed. No big deal. Hotel was a virtually empty.   Hotel is old old old. The safety on the electrical outlet kept getting tripped by the ultra-high voltage device I always carry with me...my cell phone charger. Television set was ancient and terrible. Lock on the room door was broken. This might not make sense but the room was very creaky. Bed was worn out.   Now back to my comment regarding the hotel being virtually empty. The last night of our stay a bus load of 10-13 year olds on a field trip were put in rooms on all sides of us. It was as if they literally put us in their block of rooms. There must have been forty of them with no more than one or two chaperons. They commenced to bang around and scream till the wee hours of the morning. Why is Gods name did they have to put them all around us in an empty hotel?   With so many other great options in Scottsdale certainly no reason to give this place another shot.',2
'Good customer service and nice place BUT they dont clean their tools. As I was being helped I got a pedicure and fullset I noticed they put everything back from where they got it without cleaning their tools. For my pedicure they used a dirty nail file and pumice. For my full set the nail filer was dirty as well and the desk was very dirty too. The UV light desk is super dirty as well. This would be a five start place if it wasnt for the cleanliness.',3
'GREAT Mexican joint! I always get the Baja Chicken Burro. Mmm!',4
'really cheap way to see movies. the workers at the concession stands are very nice!',4
'I am a big fan of Vietnamese food and decided to come here during my lunch hour. The restaurant is built inside a house and is super adorable even with a walkway to the front door! I walked in and was immediately greeted and was told to sit anywhere. I chose the bar and was immediately given a glass of water and a menu. Service was very friendly and helpful since this was my first time in I had no idea what to order (other than Pho). I ordered an Ahi tuna spring roll and it was so fresh and fabulous! The miso ginger sauce is really tasty and a great way to start off a meal.   Next was a half bowl of pho ga and came out really quickly. Ive had pho from many places and this one while not being the best was still tasty. It was the right amount but could have done with more meat! I decided to give this place a real test and ordered dessert since I cant drink on the clock. The only dessert they had was a ginger crème Brule which I wasnt super into but decided to order anyways. The Brule part was very overdone and the crème was a little too gingery for my liking. For $7 not worth it.  I left full and will return when I get another craving!',4
'HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I just went there to order new business cards. Five employees (including manager Candy) behind counter. One employee giving another customer what appeared to be excellent personal service. The manager and an employee chatting in the back room didnt acknowledge me (other than making contact on at least three occasions). Other two employees did not acknowledge me and took two calls while I was standing there. After checking my watch three times and not even a hello after 5 minutes I started for the door. One of the two employees then asked if could help me - too late! Called from the parking lot and had phone picked up in one ring. Sarcastically asked where besides their business I could get my business cards printed and was transferred to Candy the manager. Candy said she was surprised at the lack of help and said they could offer service. I told her she already lost a paying customers business!',1
'What a cool store! It boasts a huge variety of unique items that Ive never seen for sale before in a retail store. The best part? Reasonable prices. Definitely a place to look into if youre exploring Arizona Mills Mall!',4
'This is a fine museum with a good inventory of classic and modern art and a decent succession of featured exhibits. The building itself is large without being overwhelming and is contemporary in design. It has a spacious function hall as well as a beautifully maintained courtyard/sculpture garden suitable for a variety of events including my favorite recurring one - Art Night Out. And I really appreciate the fact that those of us on a limited budget can avail of the museums exhibits for free on Wednesday evenings and during the monthly First Friday art walk.',4
'Fun friendly Atmosphere. Sonoran chicken sub is amazing salads are good. Pizza is ok.  Great people!! And I love local family owned places!! Will be back often',4
'Had a hunger itch we needed to scratch so we ventured here on a late Sunday morning and let me tell you my friends...the itch was scratched...it was scratched feverishly well. Ok enough metaphorical jib jab...Ill get to the point here...Scratch was wonderful.  We went there on a blazing hot Sunday afternoon looking for a little refuge from the heat...and of course a satisfying late breakfast. It was a little hard to locate at first...theres a lot of construction in the area so if you arent paying attention youll miss it. Its in a really unassuming strip mall-ish location...the strip mall itself is surrounded by all sorts of retirement homes and centers if you go into the Frys next door I can almost guarantee that if youre under the age of 50 youll be one of the youngest people there...so its a bit odd that this trendy hip bakery/bistro is located here...I certainly cant imagine any retirees feeling too comfortable eating at a place like this (or maybe I just havent met enough hip older people).   We ended up trying a breakfast sandwich (served up on a yummy croissant roll) eggs florentine a crepe (with sugar and French butter) and a red velvet cupcake to top it all off. Everything was very fresh and had a crisp taste...both the breakfast sandwich and the eggs florentine seemed to focus much more on quality than quantity which I always appreciate since I dont like huge portions but would much rather savor a smaller meal...but this being said; be forewarned if you are into big portions a single menu item here may not fill you up. The crepes were probably my favorite thing we tried...cooked to perfection and filled with some sort of rock sugar which just complimented the crepe with butter really well...its pretty much a dessert but I cant help but recommend it as an addition to whatever else you may try here no matter what time of the day it is. Lastly the red velvet cupcake was just sort of okay. Weve yet to find somewhere who can make a cupcake as good as Tammie Coe...but that isnt Scratchs specialty so I cant fault them too much for it.   Overall Scratch is pretty reasonable for the quality of food youre getting (at least for the breakfast menu we had). This is yet another time when I wondered why anyone in their right mind would go to Dennys or Cocos when you can get fresher healthier and much much tastier food at a place like Scratch for about the same price. Makes me wanna go over to one of these chain breakfast places and bitch slap anyone who gives their hard earned money to an inferior product.   4/5.',4
'My friend and I had been wanting to go horseback riding in the area for a little while now. I came across a Groupon for Cave Creek Outfitters and called on Thursday to book two two-hour trail rides for Saturday morning. We had a great time got some great views and had a friendly knowledgable guide to ourselves. Definitely recommend this company for anyone who rarely rides horses and wants to get up close to some cacti in the Sonoran desert.',5
'Grotto still tops the list of must try places when in this area.',5
'Id like to give this place five stars just to drive my favorite Floridian more bananas than he already is but alas I cannot.  Its very good and worth the 20 minute drive but the service can be uneven and sometimes the custard is a little too melted.  That being said did I mention that Ill drive 20 minutes to go here and that I pass two Dairy Queens one Baskin Robbins and more of those tart yogurt places than I can count?  So yes it is creamy and delicious and very far from Florida.',4
'The Orange Blossom Papago micro-brew is a pint-sized orgasm complete with violent shaking left leg twitching and screaming out the Lords name.   If I were doing marketing for Papago I would adopt an ad campaign centered around the orange blossom:  Orange Blossom itll keep you coming (back).  I also enjoyed the Oregon-made Rogue Brown Ale.   Ive never had it on draft but it rules.  Papago is very reasonably priced and has some tasty high-carb appetizers.  I enjoyed the wings pretzels and beer bites.   They were all good but not amazing.  Four stars rather than five since they dont serve burgers.  What brewery doesnt serve burgers?  I dont know the answer...because Im still hung-over.  God bless the orange blossom my legs are weak still.',4
'This new spot is located right between two existing kick-butt restaurants -- Delux and Zen 32. And it is owned by the same group. Revo B is sure to be a hit with the trendy Biltmore crowd looking for a relaxed place to have healthy organic mexi. It will remind you very much of Blue Burrito. We ate there tonight in a soft open/evaluate the restaurant opening. Revo specializes in organic fresh ingredients including Harris ranch meats and top shelf fish--see the website. If this new kid on the block is anything like its bordering siblings we will have a big winner. I ordered the carne asada burrito but got the Chicken Fajita burrito. The floor manager apologized and promised to make the kitchen aware of the mistake but did not offer to replace. This burrito was free and really good so I didnt care. The rice side dish is very tasty with corn and lots of butter --shades of latin risotto. My wife had the same meal but in a bowl and she loved it. We also had their flavored lemonade --raspberry and mango and they were both done well. There is a choice of three different salsa/hot sauce toppings but we couldnt hear the girl behind the counter (am I 100?) and so just nodded our heads. I got something green and hot and really good. RB- consider posting these salsa options somewhere on the menu. Being the soft open there were mistakes being made with orders around us but nobody seemed to mind too much. RB is the kind of place where whatever you get you will like. They have some kind of donutty-looking deserts displayed but wont be ready to serve until the full opening. Dining area looks cramped but the stools help make it a lot more open than it first appears. There is decent sidewalk seating which will be popular when the weather is cool. There is also a walk-up take out window. Looking forward to coming back and also reading other reviews.',4
'Wow this is one of the nicest trails Ive ever been on and when I say nicer I mean fancier not nature beauty. The trail itself was a typical never ending desert flat trail. The bathrooms? Unforgettable. Im used to those crummy bathrooms with no TP and wet floors that homeless people probably use as bedrooms hiking bathrooms. These had a code on the door and an attendant watching the entrance. Seriously.  But yes the trail was nice enough and confusing enough for my Mom and I to get lost. Awesome.',4
'This is the only carrier I fly in the Western U.S.  It is always inexpensive the flights are pretty smooth except flying in to Phoenix in the Summertime can be a bit bumpy. Last Summer I took my daughter for her first flight. It was so fun. She was holding on to me so tight when we were taking off.  Seats are comfortable and I like the $10 Early Bird boarding benefit of an early assigned boarding position.  I have always enjoyed my flights.',4
'(6/26/2010-lazy posting skills) Ive heard about LGO for years but never made an effort to find it or try it until recently.  First time at LGO after a brisk morning walk with my group. After staring at the menu for 10 minutes and getting jostled around by the morning crowd our party of four came down to these choices: two jersey girl omelets a daybreaker omelet and pancakes.  Delicious!  I had a jersey omelet and was enlightened by the huge hunks of pastrami potatoes onions and chives embedded my omelet. This morning it was also served with a side berries and two pieces of toasted pumpernickel that made a lovely complement to the pastrami. I didnt get to try the daybreaker but my friends plate of turkey cut cherry tomatoes (lots of spillage which I love) and smushy yummy chunks of avocado is making me count down the days until I can schedule another visit!  The crepes looked amazing as well.  Ive never had a Havana coffee before so I gave it a whirl once they told me it had condensed milk.  Growing up with my dads coffee concoction of milk coffee and condensed milk I didnt think anyone would ever get it.  And then came LGOs Havana coffee.  Now Im hooked for life!  I love their Havana Coffee and plan on stopping in again to check out their other breakfast dishes (the Daybreaker!)  Their pizza also looks yummy - will have to check that out as well.   It was also fun to wander around the gourmet/eclectic grocery while we waited for our orders although we learned quickly that we had to have someone secure a table in the pizzeria or else it would be standing room with your plate.  I saw a lot of neat things stationary and knick knacks for sale but it was at eclectic prices so I had to pass.  I did find it cool that they had a few local artists goods for sale as well.    I cant wait to come back!  Parking is a premium as many before me have mentioned so a few recommendations: park across Campbell at the small lot or at the Arcadia Room (also owned by LGO) go for valet parking in the back of LGO or hope for the best and try to wait for a parking space in the front.  Just dont be that person and block traffic!',5
'Great food and drinks. On the pricey side but worth it.   I had the Fez Burger that has spicy honey molasses bbq cinnamon pears feta lemon garlic aioli crispy onions & cilantro on ciabatta. SO GOOD. The food is delicious and the drinks are tasty. Definitely one of the more modern trendy spots to hang out. :)',5
'The place is beautifully decorated and the food was AMAZING. I would totally go back for more of their delicious nachos. Loved the fresh salsa and the presentation was gorgeous. Will definitely leave room to try dessert next time.   The server Daniel? was wonderful! He did a great job.  I would love to give them 5 stars but there are some kinks they have to work out - what new business doesnt?   They would hands down have 5 or more stars if they had:  * A sign - people need to know if they are in the right place. * Clear hours online and on the door and adhere to them. Every minute counts when it is insanely hot and people are on very limited lunch breaks. * Open/closed sign.  * Cross-trained staff so even if the server is not there yet people can be served. * Decreased wait time between being seated and receiving water/menus. * A bell or something at the door so they hear customers coming.',4
'WARNING! If you order a bloody mary they will stick bacon in it! For all my meat eating company this was wonderful but for me I was a bit annoyed I just wish I had known...now that I do know I will nicely ask for the vegetarian bloody mary next time. As far as the food goes my whole group found it pretty average but with the second floor patio seating the premo people watching atmosphere will have us coming back.',3
'This is my husbands and my all-time favorite Mexican restaurant. You have to like spicy salsa though because they only have spicy green and spicy red salsa. Both are good if you can stand the heat! The chips are good: thin and hot (although you might have a few greasy ones at the bottom of the basket). Ive never had better green corn tamales or refried beans than I can get here. My husband likes the egg burro with green sauce all over it. Yum yum yum!!!',5
'Amazing food and ambience cant wait to make this a regular experience!',5
'Best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Period. Nothing compares to their delicious cheese-crisp fresh tortilla chips and yummy salsa. Oh and their machaca beef enchiladas with a little extra cheese will have you turning your car around by the time you reach Bethany Home and uncontrollably driving back for round two.*   Their service can be a little rough around the edges at times but in the end it really doesnt matter. You didnt go to this place to bitch and moan about service; you went here to eat the best dinner youve had all week.   My only last piece of advice... eat a lot early on in the game their dessert leaves a lot to be desired. They could get some legit honey for the sopapillas (vs. Kraft packets) and the fried ice cream is so-so.',5
'Update!  If you happen to go and enjoy your experience at Wag N Wash sign up for their frequent purchasing program. Yeah youll get the key fobs and card to use whenever you purchase something. There is one difference they do send gift / discount cards! The typical card is $10 off a minimum of a $10 purchase. So far in 10 months I have received 3 of them. Great deal that really adds up!',5
'Takamatsu is near and dear to my heart because my husband and I came here on their grand opening....and weve been coming back ever since. The manager is super-friendly and hes at the restaurant almost every night. In fact we have only visited Takamatsu once when he was not there. He greets you remembers your name comes to check on you during your meal-- excellent service without being over-attentive.   The food at Takamatsu is just down-right good Korean food. My best friend is Korean and I have traveled around Korea myself so I feel that I know a bit about the range and diversity of Korean cuisine. Takamatsu has all the Korean favorites including bulgogi (the Korean bbq) that most Americans crave. As a vegetarian I recommend the bi bim bap or the kalbi dolsot bibim bap without the beef (substitute tofu) the japchae (its actually a Japanese dish) the bibm naeng myun (ask for no beef) and the pa jeon (ask for no seafood). The great thing about Korean food is that they bring out these little dishes of yummy pickled veggies and other things before the meal. These are on the house-- so its like you get a free appetizer! (Vegetarians watch out for some of these dishes b/c some are fish cakes). Plus they bring you sweet persimmon tea on the house when your check comes. How good can it get?? The dishes sizeable and are well priced. The dining room is not fancy but is comfortable and pleasing.  I feel that some of the low reviews for Takamatsu stem from two things. #1. Most Americans are not well-acquainted with Korean food. It is not like Chinese or Japanese food-- it tends to be spicygenerally has less fat than Chinese food more fat than Japanese food and utilizes a wide range of ingredients. #2. Some people only try the sushi. Most Korean restaurants have sushi but it is NOT what they typically specialize in. If you want to see how good the restaurant is try the Korean dishes-- thats what they do best.',5
'Gotta be honest food is hit or miss so I feel its a risk to come here and although its convenient and the dining room is nice-looking I really dont feel the desire to come back. Ive had too many food fails here: cold pizza stale pita bread Veggie burger that doesnt come on a bun but on sliced toast so its falling apart wilted greens in my salad... I wonder if the management never tastes their own food? PJs been out for me for quite awhile. Too bad cause  I loved it initially. An initial hot crush thats turned pretty cold.',2
'I dont know if its in Phoenix or Scottsdale (referencing previous posts) but all the Phoenicians literature has their address as Scottsdale.     Anyway its easy to nitpick but when they charge the prices they do excellence should prevail.  The setting is lovely rooms are sumptuous (one year we did get one that was pretty rickety and needed a do-overhowever) staff is very friendly and generally accomodating.  BUT we usually arrive about noon and I end up sitting in the lobby until the room is available.  This time it was available at 3:35 PM.  Im glad we called the day before and asked for it to be expedited since were Starwood members and have stayed there several times before and would be arriving early.  I know they have a noon checkout but cmon three and a half hours to clean a room?!  They guarantee the room will be ready at 4 so I guess I should count my blessings that I got in 25 min. early.  Food in the restaurants is always good as it should be again for the prices they charge.  I cringe at a fruit cup with yogurt for $9.00.   The Center for Well-Being their spa/exercise area is very nice.  Friends and I took advantage of some of the classes such as water exercise in the pool belly dancing pilates etc.   Instructors all knew their stuff and were fun and friendly.   I am always amused by the fact that you can stay at a cheap motel off any superhighway and get free wifi coffee in the room and often free breakfast.  At The Phoenician theres no coffee pot in the room ($4. a cup downstairs) extra charge for internet access etc.    Its a lovely place but could and should be so much more.',4
'NYPD responded to my less than positive review on yelp promptly. I thought that it was cool and showed that they really care about their customers.  As requested in their response I emailed them my contact info so they could find out more about my experience. Never heard back from them. I guess its just a gimmick to make people reading yelp think they care. Instead of impressing me that gimmick has dropped my review to a 1 star. Youve officially lost our business. Grimaldis it shall be.  After the last post I received a call from their office. She was genuine pleasant and thanked me for the review. They took the time to shop the restaurant after my review. They learned that some items were being prepared improperly and that my order was placed incorrectly.  Theyre sending us gift certificates to try them again. Because she seemed sincere we will try them again.',2
'The gentlemen at Brakes Plus have been taking care of my care for a little over 2 years. They were recommended to me by my boyfriend and have been amazing. The prices are very reasonable and the work excellent. I had my oil brakes and air filter changed this time and it was done quickly and carefully. Thanks guys!',5
'So...Im not usually one to frequent corporate restaurants....but I cant stay away from those dang frozen margaritas! If it wasnt for them we wouldnt eat here half as much. I would give the menu 3 stars but there are two great things on the menu. The chili pork verde and the diablo chicken pasta. Cant go wrong there...and the Tejas trio is great to snack on if you just want a small bite.',4
'Much better selection of womens clothing than the one at San Tan but everything looks kind of disheveled like its always in the midst of the days right before Christmas.',4
'Hooray!  A market with fresh kimchee selections...  Visited after eating at Cafe GH for lunch.  Nice little market with friendly people.  Unlike many markets these folks have good prices on basics and dont overcharge.    Best kimchee selection weve found in Phoenix.  Options range from cabbage cucumber and sprouts to tofu and seaweed varieties.  They also sell kim bap (kind of Korean california rolls) which makes for a good lunch to go.  Now if I can just find a place that sells milk tea/gogo no kocha...',4
'What other restaurant offers gourmet coffee for FREE & a HOT BREAKFAST FOR 99¢??     :-)  The main store opens at 10 but the restaurant at 8 AM.

'Love the W but dont love that this is where I had to eat breakfast when i was there for my stay-cation.  Dont get me wrong the Eggs Benny are fantastic and the sushi is too but the pricing is eye-popping-high and the service yokunai desu!!  Kind of expect a jacket-required/reservation needed for their Shibuya style high prices but maybe they want to weed out the $ 30k millionaires.  Um were not in Tokyo anymore Toto.  Since there are no other options when dining at the W I will have to admit I will probably be back but not by choice.',2
'Good but not great. We shared the chopped salad which was really really good. They dont describe it on the menu but we ordered it based on all the other Yelp reviews and were not disappointed even though we probably would not have ordered it if we knew ahead of time what was in it. We also shared the fillet mignon which was cooked perfectly and they split it for us at no extra charge. The wine list by the glass was not acceptable and the glass of chardonnay that my husband ordered was room temperature. The waitress asked if he wanted some ice when he complained! He sent it back and ordered a diet coke which pretty much ruined what could have been an exceptional meal.',3
'Great late night happy hour!! This place is very fun if your looking to get a drink at night with some friends. Good appetizer specials too!',4
'Oh how I love this place. Lobster quesadilla pollo poblano mole fresh table side guac with special treats like cranberries or pomegraite thrown in. Cool art friendly staff and the best damn sangria in town!',5
'I am only going to focus on Old Town as a dining and bar destination. It is many more things; boutique shops art galleries high end hotels restaurants and even some multi family housing. It also includes the most high end mall in the state Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Old Town is the nightlife center of the Valley of the Sun. I think this was best demonstrated when the Super Bowl was in town. The game may have been played in Glendale but the celebrity parties were in Scottsdale. Over the past several years I have seen various celebrities out at the clubs in Old Town. I have seen our hometown celeb David Spade out over holiday weekends like Easter and Thanksgiving out in Old Town. Other celebs Ive spotted out over the years are Charles Barkley Steve Nash Amare Stoudemire Mike Tyson Britney Spears Paris Hilton Kendra Wilkinson  the Kardashians Dennis Rodman and Frankie Muniz (now living in the Valley.)   In March during the Cactus League Spring Training the bars are filled with groups of mostly guys that are in town to watch their fave teams play during the day and hit Old Town clubs and bars at night. You will also run into the occasional player or team scout.  The dining options are a mix of local and chain restaurants. The original PF Changs was actually located in Fashion Square Mall.',5
'Que Bueno!  We got the opportunity to enjoy El Encanto recently (for brunch) and we really did enjoy it!  We had different selections along with some traditional brunch selections/offerings.  The Chorizo and eggs was very tasty the fresh fruit the made to order omlettes all were very good. We love the courtyard patio such a nice touch and makes you feel like you are probably down in Mexico. Cant wait to come back for lunch or dinner sometime soon!',4
'First the cons: Yes the decor is dated. With full on Italian music playing. And it was a little pricey for a neighborhood Italian place.  But it gets 4 stars because the food was really good and the service. Everyone there was very friendly and warm and they really seemed to care that you enjoy your meal.',4
'Very disappointed! At first we were a little impressed. The atmosphere and vibe were different and enjoyable although the music is a little out of place for the atmosphere 70s & 80s soft rock. We ordered two appetizers- chips and salsa ($4) and the Stuffed Poblano Chilies ($11). My husband ordered the Tamales ($12). After about 10 minutes we finally had to ask about the chips and salsa. When the waitress/bartender returned she brought out the Stuffed Poblano Chili as well and said they were waiting on the chili to bring out the chips. Not one restaurant have I been at that waits to bring chips and salsa out! The chips were flashy tri colored triangles that were usual for the course. There were two salsas in very small dipping sauce sized containers like what you would get at a hamburger place when you ask for some mayonnaise. The other Appetizer which I was going to have as a meal was the Stuffed Poblano CHILES. There was ONE stuffed chili where the menu stated in two locations in the description it was POBLANOS & CHILES as in plural. That started the poor experience. The menu also stated that the chile contained Chorizo one of my favorite foods. There was none to be found. My husband had to wait about an additional long time that seemed like over 30 minutes to get his plate of Tamales. Just before the plate arrived we flagged the waitress/bartender and asked to just tab out and not even eat the entrée. We explained our displeasure with the extreme wait and pointed out that the appetizer was very small for $11 and that it did not contain the chorizo that it was said to have. At that moment my husbands dish showed up and we decided to just eat it rather than leave. The dish was not quite to the quality expected. While they did have good flavor and the red chili sauce was great the tamales themselves were hard like they had been made much earlier and left uncovered for a long time. The rice was good but the beans were only lightly seasoned and were undercooked. After eating for about five minutes the waitress/bartender showed back up and let us know that she checked with the cook and that the Chile did have lots of chorizo in it and that it was cut up real fine. Any chorizo fan knows the texture and flavor of chorizo and if there is any present. The chili contained some seasoning?cheese and tomatoes only. This was puzzling that they would argue with the customer over that sort of thing regardless of being right or wrong. After finishing our now shared meal the waitress/bartender stated that if we wanted she would get the manager to discuss our displeasure. Since we were done with our meal we decided that we would pass and just left.   I find it odd that the obvious owner in the kitchen who came out to greet friends at the bar next to us and bring deserts would not come out to address an unhappy customer on her own and make it right. For our money or yours I would go down the road to Z-Tejas. Similar menu and always good. This is very disappointing  as you want to see small local businesses do well.',1
'They were so polite. One waiter gave me a glass of water an hour after I closed my tab while I was charging my iPhone.  Great service!',4
'Excellent  bbq and if you are getting an order to go be sure to use the pick up window around the corner on Page St. for speedy and friendly ordering and pick up.  Tried the sampler with coleslaw.  The meat was fall of the bone tender and had a rich smokey flavor.  The bbq sauce included was thick smokey and tangy which was well matched with the meat.  My favorites were the chicken (some of the most tender chicken Ive had in a long time) and the pulled pork.  I wasnt a big fan of the coleslaw which was a bit bland and more creamy with an overpowering flavor of celery (seed?) than tangy but since the real star of the show is the bbq its a minor issue.',4
'I agree with the reviews about the drive through being a pain and that it took long but I was very impressed that while we waited we were visited with and had very very friendly service.  The coffee also came our correct and very good.  It hit the spot.',3
'Great simple menu. Great pricing. Had the lunch special today with my husband and it was super good. The rice and beans were very tasty. My usual pet peeve about empanadas is that they are either too greasy too doughy or the insides are greasy and tasteless. Soooo not the case here. I had the potato and the cheese one and both were very tasty not greasy and not doughy. I will definitely be back.',5
'I eat at McDonalds....I grew up on happy meals :)  Every so often I feel like having the Mcdonald fries(when I am having my cheat meal).  In review of this Mcdonalds I sometimes avoid this one and go to another so I can enjoy my fries and food!  This is the closest one to my house but when I have a McDonalds craving I would like to have good McDonalds.   I want salty lightly greased fries this McDonalds always lacks salt dry fries and most of the time they are give me luke warm fries.  By the time I get home the fries are cold?  I live within a mile of this one!  If you are looking to enjoy some McDonalds fries this McDonalds never seems to get the taste right and I avoid it when I get that craving..... If you want salt less fries cold buns on your burger visit this McDonalds.',1
'This place gets four stars just for character.  When you want to go to a place because you know it will be busy then this is it. The eggs benedict was not the best but good enough that I will eat here again.',4
'Sometimes when you work to fast you get a better result than you expected.  My husband and I were headed to see the Insight Bowl and watch our alma mater.  We had some friends in town and were meeting some people.  He asked me to yelp something on Mill about 1 minute before we left for the game.  So we headed to House of Tricks thinking it was going to be a really great bar.... maybe a coyote ugly type place given the name!  However this place is like going to an excellent attorney named Bambi. We were amazed by the atmosphere cute house super patio and very elegant with linen table clothes.  The service was very helpful thanks Ben.  So when we began to order we didnt want a three course meal.  So we ordered for seven of us a few entrees to split.  We had Korean ribs pumpkin goat cheese ravioli a cheese plate and two of their pizzas (note you can only order these in the bar).  Then I asked Ben if we were missing anything and he said the pork loin was very good.  Ummmm it was the best I have ever had.  It was cooked to perfection with a nice fruit compote over blue cheese bacon scalloped potatoes.  Really one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix.  I see House of Tricks moving up to a five star for me.  I just couldnt commit on the first visit.',4
'For our only official comedy club in the downtown area its definitely not bad. They draw some big names and without a doubt you will have a good time and laugh your tooshey off.   Having said that; the food isnt anything special the drinks are pretty lame and there is a two drink minimum the prices are severely gouged.  I understand they need to turn a profit and I dont begrudge them this but you wont catch me eating or drinking here cept for maybe a Mr.Pibb.  SGo.',4
'I love this bar. Its cozy and because its small it is an awesome place to meet other people in the neighborhood. A great place to go when you just want to feel home.',5
'Great place! Don the bartender Wed-Sun nights (3-9) is great! Very funny and does magic tricks at the bar!  The food is pretty good- big fan of the quesadilla wings bruschetta for starters. I have not had a bad special for dinner. It is a resort so expect to pay a little extra but they do have all the football games on!',4
'Friendly prompt service food delivered quick. Designed to compete with deluxe.  Had the Phoenix burger great flavor and thats no Anaheim pepper either. Love that green chile flavor.',4
'Excellent tasty subs and very friendly service. Well definitely be back.',5
'Price is high but the subs are the best I have ever had. The staff was slow and clueless the last two times I went in Chandler Last week no ice to be had in the ice machine or the drink machine! Took several shout outs until someone dumped a bucket of ice over the top and we were good to go. It takes TIME to get a sub done here call ahead because if you show up at rush time you will blow your lunch hour standing around waiting. I HATE the greeting they have to yell at every soul who opens the door just leave us cranky old people out of it! and tighten up the speed.',3
'Ok resort did isnt generally all that good. This place was perhaps even better than most in terms of food quality. The service was perhaps the slowest and worst I have ever experienced. Almost two hours for a bunch of burgers...my advice pick the other restaurant.',1
'I ate here this week with 3 of my friends and we are all around 30 yrs old. The food was GREAT! And the menu was very unique a total foodie menu. I had the pear date hazelnut pomegranate with some kind of cheese salad. It was Delicious!! Ive been craving it ever since then! I also had the quail as my entree which was very good. We shared the plum and pear tart with caramel ice cream soooo amazing! I would love to try more on their menu but Im not sure ill be returning because of the atmosphere. It is very western and not in a fun way. The reason I mentioned our ages before is because this is definitely a place for an older crowd. If you want a quiet dinner with an exciting menu then I recommend it. If you want a fun lively pretty dinner go elsewhere. This place would be 5 stars if they gave it a makeover!',3
'The dining room is a tad bit claustrophobic but the food is worth the minor discomfort! I like starting my night off snacking on wine saturated pieces of fruit out of a glass of house sangria and then moving on to some guilt free baked wings. The Fennel Orange Salad is almost as good as the Brussel Sprout Salad at Chelseas but hands down my favorite dish at LGO is the Padre (which is no longer on the regular menu but theyre still more than happy to make it for you); a pizza with arugula fig point reyes blue and prosciutto di san daniele. My fallback pizza is the Fallen Angel and even though Im a die hard carnivore Ive heard plenty of rave reviews from my skinny vegetarian friends about the avocado pizza and the roasted corn pizza. If youre feeling really daring ask for egg on your pizza! Sounds funny but if youre an egg slut like me youll find that this might be what has been missing from your pizzas for all your life! And if you dont have time to dine in you can order take out in the LGO grocery store - I highly recommend taking home a bag of the heavenly homemade English muffins or for a lighter meal the Stacked Turkey sandwich on a baguette! You really cant go wrong with any choice you make at LGO or really - at any of their sister restaurants!',5
'Zipps has and awesome happy hour special. You have to try the zipparitas for only 3 bucks a piece. They limit 3 per person but thats plenty for one person. The wings are tasty meaty and cheap! Outdoor seating is nice even in cooler weather. Theres a big fireplace to huddle around along with heat lamps in the ceiling. Our waitress was a sweetheart!',4
'This place is near my boyfriends house so we found ourselves ending our days there on the patio. We were there during the week so it was never crazy packed but there was a good crowd of people. They have good drink specials and the burrito I had there was pretty bomb. Ill definitely be back plus this one looks a lot classier than the one in Tempe.',4
'Fresh and tasty sushi in Central Phoenix?  Im so in love!    Love love love the concept!  After seeing this place posted in Hot New Places on Yelp some friends and I went for lunch today.  The owner (its a franchise that started in Austin) greeted us outside and was very personable.  You can pick your rice wrapping 3 veggies/cream cheese and a meat and you get 10 PIECES OF SUSHI all for about $7-8.  They also have all kinds of sauces you can add for free!  I had white rice with seaweed wrapping asparagus avocado mango and spicy tuna with unagi sauce on the side.  Delish!  Loved it!  I also had the cucumber salad which was also really really good!  My only disappointment was the miso soup which didnt really seem to have any flavor -- it was weird.  Other than that the food was great!    I also love that they are rebuilding that area!  Once they get done with the construction on the other side of McDowell that will be great little go-to spot!  Dinner at How Do You Roll and drinks at Sidebar! :)  Woot woot!',4
'Excellent! Had the green chili pork enchiladas and was not disappointed ! Friendly staff great atmosphere !',5
'Brunch is awesome.  Ive come here on two occasions for Brunch and have left satisfied. Ive had the sausage hash as a wet chimichanga and it was delicious (though I dont know how anything deep fried cannot be delicious). Last sunday I got the benedict arnold and it too was great. Even the fake canadian bacon tasted like real meat (though more like bologna which I think is still delicious).  But the real star of each brunch was the zeppole. Delicious fried donut balls with an sublime strawberry sauce! HEAVEN!   I dont quite understand why they just dont use the space from Green to host brunch since all the food comes from that kitchen anyway but I guess its a branding thing  The rest of the time nami is fine. Everything is ok to good such as the drinks pastries and tsoynamis. The donuts Ive had there (besides the zeppole tend to get stale very quickly.)  I do get a kick out of the fact that their symbol looks like a little poo.',4
'A new and refreshing venue with good coffee and a relaxing laid back environment. Inside offers a warm and inviting atmosphere and the patio faces east away from the afternoon sun; which is a big plus in Phoenix. Plenty of space inside to sit and enjoy or do a little work. Owner was extremely friendly and courteous. Definitely recommend stopping by.',5
'I am unsure why this place has 4 stars. It was mediocre at best. The only reason Im giving it 3 stars is because our server was so sweet. I felt their menu items were lacking. Reasonably priced for sure but just not a lot to choose from. They are vegan friendly which is nice. Im not a vegan but I like eating healthy so the fact that the options are available (like tempeh which I love) are a plus. But they didnt even have many options for coffee. The food took a fairly long time considering they werent very busy. The server explained everything is made fresh and thats why it takes so long. Isnt everything made fresh at most small restaurants? I would expect nothing less? Just seemed unusually long. The food itself was decent but I felt like it was something I couldve made myself in my kitchen. I definitely wasnt blown away by anything and overall the place just seemed very average. Not a bad thing I guess but wouldnt be anywhere close to my first choice for brunch. Sorry!',3
'Meh. Ive experienced better its totally correct! However if you live close by and want something to feed the family that is ok and relatively cheap this a good place. Its very loud inside and the decor is very busy but nice.   My reason for one start is because three times now we have ordered to go food and it seems that our dish was sabotaged each time! Twice came without chicken and all twice with the bread being super cold as taken out of a freezer recently. One time came swimming in sauce and it became disgusting to eat.   I called the restaurant for one of the occasions. They didnt act if it was important or a big deal. They refunded me only after I requested and it took over a day. I was told someone would call me back to follow up and I received no calls.   If you are in business to serve people their meals you should take a little extra precautions that the food is done correctly. I should not have to get home with hungry kids and have items missing. This should never happen twice or even a third time.   It seems to me that this Bucca di Beppo is careless with the food they serve and how they treat their customers.',1
'This place ROCKS! Ive been here plenty of times before but this experience from last Friday night was outstanding. We took my mom here for her birthday dinner. We called in for reservations & to see if we could reserve a booth 2 HOURS BEFORE we were going to go there- they said no problem! Upon arrival we were seated at a reserved booth and our server Diana N. spared no time to come and get our drink order! Let me just say Diana N. made my moms birthday extra awesome! She was a fantastic server and went above and beyond. She even gave us an amazing churro/icecream birthday dessert (I doubt they do that for everyone).  We definitely will be going back soon!',5
'meh.   I have a few Arizona-native friends who RAVE about Nellos and HOW GREAT it is and its the BEST PIZZA EVAR! Ive been a handful of times and its pretty average in my opinion. I think its funny someone else mentioned the raspberry iced tea because I strongly believe theyre staff has never tasted it or else they would be ashamed to serve it and then charge their customers for drinking it.   Their pizza cookie mabob is different than your standard Oreganos/BJs pazookie which I enjoy.   Oh also they double booked my group of 40+ a few days before an event and we had to scramble to find a replacement venue.',3
'Great place for lunch after walking the mall or to even make the trip solely to come here!   Tuscan inspired food with well developed flavors and plenty of attention to detail in the presentation as well as the preparation.   To start the bread... oh my... the bread!  Warm bread with perfection when it comes to the outer crust vs. soft inside ratio.   I should mention that there was also a crispy flavored flat bread  but honestly I just could not get passed the Italian bread and butter!  We shared the Roasted Garlic Spinach & Artichoke Dip  Served bubbling hot with Parmesan flatbread  ($8.95).   It was good pretty standard restaurant dip but the flat bread served with it definitely kicked it up a notch.   I enjoyed the Pasta Pomodoro with Chicken  Angel hair with grilled chicken tomatoes pine nuts and a cilantro pesto drizzle ($13.65).  It was fresh with the chicken prepared and seasoned well.  The flavors complimented each other very well and made the dish satisfying but not overwhelming.  My companion had the Brio Bistecca Burger*  With bacon Provolone lettuce roasted tomato mayonnaise and Pinot Noir onions. Served with housemade chips. ($12.35) (sub fries for the chips)  Yes a burger and fries at an Italian restaurant!  He seemed very impressed with it and commented several times that it had really good flavor.   Service:  Very helpful extremely pleasant and very accommodating.    I should mention if you sign up for their email club you receive a free meal of Steak and shrimp scampi for your birthday.  Being that I dont eat red meat and dont like shrimp they allowed me to substitute my entree for that.  By the way... definitely worth signing up for the email club! :)  Love this place whether for a casual lunch or would be a great date place too!',4
'I never knew how great Arizona could be until I visited my brother in Tempe last week.  Changing Hands is fun I ended up spending around $25 for a used book a cute bookmark a plush hamster and some cards with cupcakes on them.    They get major bonus points for carrying nifty tools such as the spaghetti fork that twirls for easy eating.  If you need to write thank you cards they have a great selection to choose from.  My cashier was very nice and the atmosphere was comfortable.  I think some of the customers had been setting up camp in there for most of the morning.  The best part is you dont need to worry about packing rations since they have a cafeteria attached to the store.',5
'Even though I have lived in Phoenix for over 10 years I found the tour a wonderful experience.  First off you will visit locally owned restaurants that are unique with very tasty food.  I was full after visiting 5 restaurants.  The food portions was just enough.  Also the historical information is interesting.  Even though I knew some of the information of the places we passed I still learned something new.  The walk wasnt bad at all but I recommend comfortable shoes.  This has peaked my interest and I plan to try other food tours.',4
'This review is for Tangible Fitness right next door.  This place is great.  They actually allow you to pay as you go.  Membership is $25 a month which is definitely worth it.  Their equipment is clean and in good condition and they have a nice selection.  I wouldnt mind if they had a couple more eliptical machines.  They only have 3 of the kind that I prefer to use and if its busy you may have to wait to use one.  You get a free week trial also.  Theres a variety of different people who visit this gym and the staff is very friendly.',4
'Not really impressed. Paid 14.75 for two plain yogurts split flavored with no toppings. Which was mediocre at best.  They price the yogurt with a scale. Ill stick to ice cream :P. You are pretty much paying for the atmosphere here.',2
'I dont eat fried chicken very often but this chicken fingers are very tasty. Not like other franchise fried chicken. I did not get fries and got extra chicken fingers.   The place is small but the owner Alin is awesome man. I was very much focusing on the chicken and sauce. Havent tried all the sauces but will give them a shot.   Some people tweet on social network about the tasty Chicken meals. Even news crews were there as well. Now the only place you can find their coupon is http://www.smartlocalshoppers.com/store/view/promotions/1054/  The owner will even give more free stuff if you show the coupon on your iPhone or smart phone. So you dont have to print and bring in the coupons.   I would recommend everyone to eat at their restaurant. The chicken fingers are too tasty to resist! Best Fried Chicken in Town.',5
'Ive been coming to Mannys since I moved to AZ about 3 years ago. The cuts are consistently good I dont have to wait long and the price is good. Even when Ive had to use hand signals to communicate since I dont speak a word of Spanish its like the lady read my mind since I still got what I wanted.',4
'I feel horrble to have to say this to my fellow yelpers but working with Checker Pool and Pump Supply was a horrible experience.  The whole thing.  From the intial phone call I made to the office to the final installation of the new motor.  Just awful.  First the phone call to the office was less than desired. The fellow who answered the phone wasnt terribly helpful and told me that he couldnt schedule anything but he would send my call to one of his technicians.  Okay.  A couple hours later a technician called. He was abrubt and abrassive in his tone asking me to describe what was wrong and then interrupting me when he figured out that he knew better than I did what the description was.  He came and diagnosed the problem while I was at my office in Chandler. He very tersely told me either I come in an hour or on Monday.  I had just come back home to 114 degree weather so I thought it better he come quickly than wait 5 days.  So he came.  Then he called from the car and told me he had taken my motor as it needed to be repaired. I wasnt given a choice.  He just took it.  So now I cant have someone else come out and give me another price quote.  Of course this fellow still hadnt told me what was wrong or what the price would be - he just took my motor and called me from the car.  When he returned on Tuesday (not on Monday as he promised because he said I didnt answer the phone soon enough for him and he couldnt leave the motor without any money from me) he installed a new motor without telling me. He told me on the phone that if he couldnt repair the motor someone would call and quote me the price for a new motor.  I guess not and what choice did I had - he still had my old motor.  So we were forced to accept the new motor since it was already installed without a price or a pre-installation discussion.  He then told us that a pipe was cracked and that the suction for the pool pump was compromised but he didnt fix it.  Why not offer to fix it?  And after he left he left our pump clock on for just 2 hours.  Really?  In the summer?  And he didnt tell us the fill valve was also broken.  A cheap 20.00 part that I am sure he had on the truck would have fixed that.  The new motor was 289.00 which I am told is very fair but then they charged 16.50 for shop labor (for what) and nearly 100.00 for the miscellaneous parts needed to install the motor and 95.00 for his labor.  The price should have been about 385.00 in my opinion.  If he had repaired the plumbing and the fill valve so we didnt have to have someone else come by I might have thought 580 was fair?  But now we have to have more work done on the pool by another company.  This particular technician was so horrible I am afraid to call this company ever again. He was rude to me and to my husband and',1
'This was a visit for a casual dinner with a couple of friends yesterday (10/21). I have to say initial impressions are good and the place has earned the good grades.   We made reservations and were promptly seated at a nice table indoors. There was live music outside which was piped in. It was at a good sound level. Our waiter promptly came to take our drink orders and was quite social and courteous. He did take a moment to get to know us but not in that creepy lingering waiter type of way. His knowledge of wine was very good and he made excellent recommendations for the dish that I had selected.  On to the food. I ordered the 5th and Wine Burger with bacon added and seasoned fries as the side. Food quality was good. I ordered the burger medium and it came out medium. The beef was good but did not rise to the level of quality at the Grind or DeLux Burger though granted unlike the other two restaurants mentioned this one is not a burger specialist. The fries were excellently seasoned and just the right mix of crispiness and potato goodness. Overall a good presentation of a burger and fries.   Wine is the strong suit of this restaurant with a long list of by the glass selections and an even bigger list of by the bottle selections. Their breadth nicely reflects Italian French and American selections however was lacking in the South African and South American vintages. I consider a good Pinotage as an absolutely necessary selection within the spectrum of reds. My Spanish Tempranillo was excellent. I have to laud the beverage service here because the waiter knew enough to bring it out early so that it could breathe.   The atmosphere and architecture is very nice with great seating and interesting art on the walls. I didnt get a chance to venture outside but it seemed very lively.   Grades:  Overall:   A-   (No demerits taken)   Food:      B    (Good presentation of a burger with good food quality                         however did not pass the Ramsay Test* for an A).  Drinks:    A     (Excellent wine knowledge and service technique was                          displayed by the waiter coupled with a good selection                         makes this a great place to enjoy wine)   Service   A     (Good service as explained above)    *Ramsay Test:  Chef Gordon Ramsay says that if you are going to make and serve a simple dish it needs to be executed with perfection. I will not give an excellent or A rating for a simple classic dish unless it is executed with perfection and is a sound and creative interpretation of the dish.',4
'Having opened just a few weeks ago La Piazza Locale brings the 2nd VPN-certified Neapolitan pizza to downtown Phoenix.  The first thing I thought when I found this place was What dont we have enough excellent pies downtown?  But we had to try it anyways.  My friend went with Rocco and I went with the special of the day Don Matteo (smoked butternut squash puree as the sauce with speck and mozarella).  My first observation was that the crust had the soupiness that a real Napoletana pizza should have.  The crust was perfect.  This is knife-and-fork pizza and if you think their crust is too soggy youre wrong.  The smoked butternut was phenomenal.  Im not sure thats a real authentic ingredient for Neapolitan pizza but it was probably one of the top three pies I have ever eaten.  My friends Rocco was pretty good too but the Don Matteo was definitely at a whole different level.  My only real complaint about this place was that the music was a little too loud and too trendy.  When dining I dont like it when the music is too noticeable.  I usually prefer restaurants not to be too trendy but everything else about the restaurant was great so I can let this pass.  Locale is now on my short list of best pies in the Valley.  Its not as good as Bianco but its top tier.',5
'I have taken my dogs here for ever and loved the vets and staff.   My dog suddenly became very sick on a Wednesday morning and I knew that the office opens at 7:30am.  We got there early and waited. The receptionist opened the doors on time and I struggled to get my 100lb dog into the building.  My dog collapsed on the floor barely breathing and she tells me that the vet will not be in for another 30 min!!!!!  Why would you open a veterinary clinic without a vet present!?   I had to have someone help me get her back into the car and by this time my dogs tongue was blue.  We got to emergency and she died less then an hour later.   Thanks Prestige for the help on one of the worst days of my life. I hope it was worth sleeping in...',1
'CALLING ALL BEER LOVERS! (Even if you think you dont like beer Papago probably has a brew to change your mind.) This place is great! They always have something like 30 beers on tap one on cask and also a huge selection of hundreds of bottled beers in their coolers. Their draft selection changes almost daily except for a few staples. The Papago Brewery beers are great and sometimes they even make special batches with peppers etc.  One of the things that makes Papago so special though is their staff. All of their staff members are incredibly friendly and helpful. They will remember you and make friendly chat with you and then suggest a beer for you if you cant pick.  Papago is kind of a drive for me and my husband but we always wind up here a couple of times a week for a few pints and a pizza. Oh I forgot to mention that their pizza is amazing!! We always get the white pizza and we loveeee it!!!',5
'Okay okay... Ive checked in enough times I really should write a review for this bank.   First of all I need to say that I have definitely seen improvements in their drive-thru lanes. 95% of the time that is what I use here. They have 3 ATM drive-up stalls and lately theyve all been working fine. (This past summer it was hit/miss if they would accept cash deposits or not.) But now that theyve installed new cash-takers on the machines things seem to be working much better.   Inside there typically is a line however it moves fast because they always seem to have 5-6 tellers. Most of the tellers are bi-lingual here.   It has taken me years and years to want to work with BofA again after their serious mistakes with an acct of mine in CA; but -- I do enjoy the benefits I get with the US Airways debit card.',3
'Pretty darn good but quite pricey even though you get big portions you always have to take a bunch home.  I would like the option to buy less & pay less.  This is smoked meat NOT BBQ.  Many people try to compare the two but they are different.  Some people just dont like smoked meat & some go in looking for BBQ and they will probably be disappointed.  If you like slow smoked meat you will be happy here. Also if you truly like smoked meat you already know to get the meat DRY not WET.  The individual decides on how much if any sauce to put on.  Try their beef ribs(dry) if you like ribs.  Pork ribs just dont smoke as good in my opinion. Ive been here 5 or so times and have never had anything dry of course we go at lunch time so maybe its just fresher than at dinner (?)',4
'Pretty cool establishment. I had dinner at the bar which I highly recommend. The staff at the bar were very attentive. I had a couple of Maui Brewing Company coconut porters w/ dinner. I was pretty impressed they carried the brand one of my favorites. For dinner I had the egg and pancetta pizza which was pretty darn good. However it could have used more pancetta and less crust. Next time in Phoenix Ill be back for more.',4
'Scale of 1-10 (single visit): 9 Food 9 Service 8 Atmosphere 8 Value  This is the best place Ive found in Phoenix thats styled after the by-the-slice pizzerias of NYC.  I think they overextend their menu a little bit but if thats whats necessary to survive in Phoenix where foot traffic doesnt exist because of our strip center developments ill take it.  The people were friendly the food was tasty and generous the atmosphere was happenin (though the ordering process was tricky to figure out at first) and the pizza-by-the-slice prices were definitely fair.  3 massive slices and 3 breadsticks for under $15.    Id like to see this place put together a Bianca pie.  I bet they could do it some serious justice....',4
'So sad to see the prior owners go!  The food is very different though the menu reads the same.   Brunch?(seriously NOT Italian) and just sad!  I get the re-creation idea but man drop the name... change it.  We went in thinking it was the same place and sadly its not.  Those of us that frequented over the years are sad to see it go and are disappointed that the recipes have been changed and further Americanized.',1
'Great hotel did a staycation here recently and its a beautiful property.  As a starwood member they put us in an upgraded room and with a beautiful view and we enjoyed the pools lazy river and watching people maneuver the flow rider.  They have a few restaurants on site but their crown jewel deseo was closed until September or October..bummer as we were hoping to try it.  Christine at the concierge desk knew it was our anniversary so she sent up champagne and strawberrys for us to enjoy!  Very nice! We were up early to enjoy coffee and watch the golfers tee off just after sunrise. Would definitely return its a top notch facility.',5
'For those who have been to the Gelato Spot I have to say that Arlecchino which I discovered before the New Times article and is easy to locate but difficult to stop by (thanks to LGOs popularity) has to be the best gelato I have ever tasted. The owners passion for his product can definitely be tasted and is amazing. He uses fresh fruits is originally from Italy (and you can only help but notice). What I really enjoy about going there is the passion and pride you can see in the owners work. If only parking was easier it would be an even bigger hit.',5
'Great selection of yogurt. The season specials are always worth trying. The topping bar is much more robust than other places and is open on both sides to make it easier to get to. No ducking under glass.  When the weather is nice the firehouse style  door opens up to flow into the patio seating.   Customer service has always been good they will answer any questions you have.  We went on weeknight when wearing your pajamas got you a special deal.',4
'Yay I am fan too!  I saw this place open recently and knew I would get in to try it eventually.  Well last week was my chance... I actually came twice last week that is how much I liked it.  The owners are extremely nice and attentive and the sandwiches are spectacular!  I have to say I am a condiment hater... manly just one kind of condiment mayonnaise or any variation of that:)  What I loved about this place is they have a tuna salad with no mayo!! it is awesome!  they also add capers to the tuna salad which add such a great flavor.  I had them add some pesto and olive tapenade to my sandwich... it was sooo good I basically had to force myself to stop eating it.  I will definitely be back... cant wait to try a different sandwich and some crepes too!',5
'Ive been to both the Tempe and Gilbert offices when I moved to Arizona.  Dr. Alprin saw me for my pregnancy in 2009.  I was never very fond of Dr. Alprin.  He makes you feel like another number and there was no personal connection unlike the fantastic bond I had with my doctor with my first child.  He also failed to inform me until my 8th month that unless he was scheduled for that day I went into labor that he wouldnt be delivering my baby.  I had a doctor I had never met deliver my baby.  When I moved more east of the valley I started going to the Gilbert office and signed up to see Dr. Hartzfield.  Oddly enough she could never see me and I was always seen by a nurse practitioner.  in 2011 I became pregnant again and sure enough she wasnt available to see me for my first prenatal appointment.  When it came time for an ultrasound I found out that I had miscarried.  It was a very sad and stressful experience.  This was the one and only time Dr. Hartfield ever saw me.  She tried pushing a D&C on me right away and I let her know that was not something I was interested in doing and would rather take the misoprostol instead.  She prescribed me two pills.  They did not work.  I called and asked for more a week later she said no and wanted me to have a D&C.  I was firm and said I did not want a D&C and to PLEASE give me a stronger dose of misoprostol.  She prescribed me ONE pill.  I said that isnt going to work if two pills didnt work last time.  She didnt care.  I took the one pill anyway and inserted in vaginally even though she wanted me to take it orally.  I read online that most Drs tell you to insert the pills vaginally so thats what I did and prayed that having only one pill would work.    I miscarried right away.    I cant believe she wouldnt give me a proper dose.  All they care about is money obviously.  Misoprostol is an inexpensive drug.  I did not want an invasive surgery.  I wanted to miscarry at home and be alone.  I found out that she is no longer at this location but I will never go back after my experience.',1
'Its awesome I love the food.  They even have Indian cuisine and Chinese food here now.  I like the steak on a stick. If I get a turkey leg I ask for a less well done one that will still be moist inside.  Tickets are $22 at the gate $20 at frys grocery store.  Entertainment book often has buy 1 get 1 adult free for opening weekend the Presidents Day and closing weekend (busiest times of the season) and a buy 1 adult get a child free coupon that is good any day.  I saw a new performance this time the water fountain lady with the doofus donkey guy. It was less than impressive but older ladies may like it a lot.    This was my first visit I tried to take food on the bird flight demonstrations but the polite guard lady said not to go on grass because birds have attacked people with food even the slushy ball of ice.',5
'For my 300th review I wanted to write about somewhere that I have been yearning to try for a long time.  This was my first visit to Postino and it definitely lived up to the hype.  Ever since I moved to Phoenix I have observed that every time I am hanging out at a wine bar with friends this place inevitably creeps into the conversation.  Oh look they have a comfy couch like at Postinos.... This bruschetta is not as good as Postinos....Cool their happy hour glass price is only $5 like Postinos. So I have felt a need to visit for a while but just never been able to make it happen.  I live in Chandler and work in Scottsdale so I dont really visit downtown/uptown Phoenix often.  And when I pulled into the parking lot I remembered why.  No place to park except in a tow away zone so my friend and I had to drive a ways down the street.  Say what you want about the suburbs but sometimes it is just nice to drive up park walk in and be immediately seated without a hassle.  Once we had settled in to our comfy seats however our cares melted away.  Our server was super nice and friendly (as everyone there seems to be). Even though we took advantage of the awesome $5 glass special we both wanted to try each others selections so she brought us extra glasses.  We noshed on a fantastic bowl of olives while enjoying our wine and deciding what to order. Of course I knew going in that I needed to order the bruschetta board but my plan had been to get it for an app and then order something else.  My friend suggested getting that as a meal to share which actually worked perfectly since the portions are surprisingly large.  You get to pick four different selections (very hard to do since they all sound awesome) and then each one is so big they cut it into three bite size pieces.  We did finish with a cappuccino and split a dessert mostly because we just didnt want to leave yet couldnt keep ordering wine since we had to drive afterwards. So there you have it the perfect meal!  Top it off with a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum down the street afterwards and you are in perfect day territory.  I hope to visit Postino again with the hubby some time in the future.  I had been envisioning someplace a little more girly and a lot more pretentious but it really is very homey and laid back so I know he would love it too. There was a real diverse crowd when we were there.  Plus they have a decent beer selection in addition to the fab wine list so that will help get him in the door. Now if only it was more conveniently located.  Well I hear that they are opening one up in Gilbert soon so we just may have to become regulars there!',4
'Just moved here from SoCal. And it felt great not traveling just to watch an NFL game! Stadium is ok not great! Food was good but very expensive. But overall the family and I had a Very good time. I am not complaining especially I have an team to root for now!',4
'This June I was flooded out of a ground floor apartment.  The landlord put me up at the Clarendon Hotel where I was immediately reminded of Miami Florida during the 70s.  Rainbow stripped tiles lead your eye across the pool area and around the insides of the pool deck ledge.  The saltwater is soothing and tear-free with even more properties to be desired.  A favorite pool activity is floating in the water.  The buoyancy of my mind and body were enhanced by the saltwater and listening to the underwater music system.  This weightless feeling made the whole experience quite relaxing.   It also describes what a stay at this hotel can be for a guest.  Easy carefree and weightless.  The standard room has a king bed and ample table space.  Some art on the walls looked quite unique.  One piece on a wood plank that was mounted to slide from one end of the room to the window.  It was more functional than practical but intriguing nonetheless.  The other side of the room had a black shade covering another window out the opposite side of the building.  Calming music filled the room from the iPod dock and heated glass with a blueberry scent met my senses as I first entered the room.  It was nicely accommodated with locally made products in a basket.  The amenities included unlimited bottled water ice and snacks along with a spectacular wine cooler.  There is really not much left to do with a toilet seat when it lowers without slamming the bathroom sink is broad and waste basket narrow.  The shower sports dispensers for shampoo conditioner and soap to reduce the waste of little bottles.   When you get the remote A/C unit set to just the right temp it feels like you are set to kick back and enjoy a great stay.  Check out was quick without surprise add-ons.  I would like to repeat this again soon just without the flood as the impetus to my taking the room for the night.  Breakfast at Gallo Blanco across from the hotel lobby was so tasty that I went out to Otro Café that weekend for brunch and can enthusiastically recommend both places as well but that is for another review.',5
'Yes it looks bad from the outside. Suck it up and give it a try. This is in my hood so the location doesnt bother me. Its a diamond in the rough.   Pizza is delicious prices are fantastic and the family vibe makes it all better.',4
'Not sure why I decided to go back after the first visit. Please dont support a restaurant that upcharges you $2 to substitute rice instead of fries. Cmon now.  Ridiculous. Also go check out Kyhber halal up the street insetad',1
'My favorite sports bar! They have different specials and menus every night and my favorite is on Fridays...grilled fish tacos! The service is usually good however depending on the server and how busy they are it can be a bit slow. We go there quite often and the wait staff that serve us freqently remember our usual drink orders...even the kids! The wings are great...try them grilled! I can honestly say that I have never ordered something I havent liked. Burger wise try the Alamo Chipotle burger! Other favorites are the Gyro salad Jack not Jill Chicken sandwich and the Lavosh. I always get either the jalapano slaw or sweet potato fries as my side. Ive only had breakfast there one time out of all the years of going here but it was very good too. Yeah it gets loud but thats only because it gets crowded!',5
'Too many restaurants too little room in my pants.  Although on my list Fogo De Chao had taken a back seat to other less deserving establishments it seems.  Not forgotten just cast aside for the time being.  I hang my head in shame at that now.  I could not resist the abundance of tempting offerings at the salad bar.  Since I could not possibly try everything and still eat meat I opted to sacrifice everything green.  I filled my plate with cheeses smoked salmon prosciutto roasted veggies and everything not in the leafy green category.    At the table I could also not resist the fried polenta and fried bananas.  And those little popovers!  Since they were small I didnt count how many I consumed.   Leaving little room for the meat attraction what I did sample was tender and flavorful.  Big thanks to Gabi and the wonderful staff in the front and in the kitchen who made sure we were taken care of from start to finish.  Once I recover Ill be back for more!',5
'When my husband and I were first married my gynecologist told me that I may have trouble conceiving babies because of a few small problems. I was a little nervous when she told us but not too concerned because I was still young and knew I wanted to be a young mom. We had been trying to have a baby for about a year when I voiced my frustrations with a friend who recommended we see Dr. Amols. At first I was hesitant and really just wanted to get an idea of what may be happening and what steps we could take in the future if we still were unable to get pregnant. Dr. Amols quickly got me started on my labs and testing and we were shocked to find out that my biological clock was ticking much faster and had much less time left than we had expected. In fact we were soon concerned that an egg donor may be needed. Dr. Amols was great at answering our questions and listening to concerns before we started treatment but we also fully trusted his opinion on what he thought was the best option. He was great at calming us down and talking to my husband and I on a personal level not just a doctor to patient appointment. He even called one weekend from Home Depot to fill us in on the latest lab results. Because of him we are excited to be welcoming twin boys in late October and will definitely be going back soon for more kids!  Not only was Dr. Amols friendly and knowledgable his staff was amazing as well. When I called to schedule appointments or ask questions the nurses knew who I was personally and I felt as if I was not just another voice on the phone to them. I recommend him to anyone whenever I can. We are grateful that we were put in contact with AZARH and Dr. A.',5
'$7 for three small tacos.  The flavors were not that great.',2
'It was really fun and had great tacos! Every taco I ate became my favorite one and I couldnt really choose from all of them. The couple that did stand out were a pork belly taco and this other pork taco where the restaurant was giving generous amounts of guac and salsa on the side.   It was a great event that I would go to again if I am in town :)',5
'I think this is my favorite airport I have been to in the last two months. I was extremely happy to find out they have free wifi! This is a major plus for me. They security line was easy breezy (I was traveling United) and the staff seemed friendly. Even when I sat down for a quick cocktail and bite to eat the server made sure I got everything fast. Best airport Ive been to in awhile and I travel a lot!',4
'NOTE:....this would have been a 5... but Pam took 2 stars off!  This Lennys Burger at 59th Ave and Peoria 10635 N. 59th Ave Glendale Az 85302  FOOD IS AMAZING Cowboy Burger...Pretty Great..! Pastrami Burger - Phenomenal..! #2 is a Double that is Amazing and my sons Favorite Onion rings -  perfect Beer Batter..! French Fries..(If you love fries you will love these)  They use a super fine salt (So Could use a Super Fine Pepper)   Our second experience at the location left more to be desired. It seems our order through the drive-thru it was taken and the woman on the phone was pleasant and everything went well until the order came.  It seemed fine until we explained that we took the $0.60 upgrade on all three meals and we double checked the order and found a french fry we brought it to their attention and it seemed like was not going to be much trouble.   BOY THAT WAS THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE NIGHT....!!  Normally I would have have jumped in the middle of the of PAM and my wife about the issue and put the cab-bash on it and keep it civil..!! That never happened and I literally sat back in my chair as Pam would Literally NOT STOP GETTING INCREASINGLY LOUDER to over talk my wife over  S-I-X-T-Y-C-E-N-T-S..  So needless to say we never got the fries and in the words of the movie 8Mile  All well that ends O.K. so we say F you Pam and have a nice day ...!!  So with that  Food is awesome Service is great when you dons set Pam off! By the way our Third trip through food was good and Yes Pam waited on us and it was simple and in and out.   We will roll through again... Thank God for Limo Tint',3
'I thought I was just the uncool kid not in-the-know.. but I quickly scanned the reviews and didnt see anyone mention... Rock Springs Cafe HOGS N HEAT!!!  Every first Sat of the month its all you can eat BBQ at their outdoor patio (you cant see this HUGE patio / BBQ smoker area from the freeway)  with live music... bikers mixed w/ families and obviously those in the know.  Apparently they do it all year hot or cold... but the weather is sooo awesome right now Im rating it 4 stars for only decent bbq but relaxing atmosphere and toe tappin muzak.  I dont know if its a regular thing but there were $1 pie slices for charity.. .the peach crumb rocks!',4
'I love going to this place. It has a great atmosphere. I always try to sit by the duck pond. My baby as well as my tablemates love to watch the ducks and turtles. There is always some drama with the goose and mallards. Its great. It is like watching the discovery channel.  I give the atmosphere 5 stars.   The food is good. Is it the greatest Mexican? No it isnt. The food is probably a 3. It is good Mexican and I enjoy it. The chips and salsa are good because you get 3 different salsas. I have had the salad fresca with shrimp and it was good. I did not think the shrimp was worth it and would probably just get it plain next time.   If you are in Cave Creek you should go here or take out of town guests. There is no atmosphere like it. Plus afterwards you can check out the shops across the street.',4
'Last night four of us had a fabulous dinner.  We have been coming here for years. The menu is wonderful....something for everyone.  The food is so fresh and prepared so perfectly and comes to the table hot.  The meat sauce is a home run as well as just about everything on the menu.  The wine list is extensive and has a price point for everyone.  We are never disappointed dining here.  Make sure you make a reservation!',5
'Great independent bookstore. Huge selection... I like that they have used and sale books mixed in with the new books in each section so you dont have to look in multiple places. Lots of seating plus its connected to Wildflower Cafe so you can always pop over there for a coffee or lunch.   Nice collection of small gifts journals moleskines etc as well.',5
'Im from Phoenix so I didnt know what to think of the sketchy parking lot when I drove up at 6:00 am. But WOW! I just had the BEST English muffin breakfast sandwich Ive ever had (better than homemade even). And for $3? Yes please. And with French pressed coffee? Yum! The staff are very cool and obviously care about the ingredients they put in the food. The parking lot looked friendlier once the sun came up too.',5
'Like everyone has said before Korean food served Hawaiian plate lunch style. Big portions are good but a little much for lunch. Prices are good. While the Korean is not as good as its possible to get in Phoenix (i.e. Hodori) its still quite good. Easily my favorite Asian restaurant within walking distance of ASU.',4
'Yum! My husband and I go twice a week. The food is authentic fantastic and prepared by the owners a nice greek family. Casual dining order at the counter and they bring it to your table. Clean modern decor. Great prices. Everything from the hummus to the spanakopita and baklava is delicious. May I recommend the veggie pita? You can thank me later.',5
'Worst. Customer Service. Ever.  My husband (G) went to this center today to get some screws for a microwave we were given after striking out at Ace Home Depot etc. G told the Customer Service Rep what he needed and after searching his computer a bit he declared that he wasnt able to help G WITH ATTITUDE - like G was putting him out by asking him to do his job.  G asked to speak to the manager in the hopes that he might be able to get some actual help and was told that no he wouldnt get the manager for G because G had an attitude and needed to leave the store. Keep in mind that my husband hadnt said anything rude or raised his voice. He had simply asked to speak with a manager. G was floored... what had he done to deserve this?   After he left the center he called and unfortunately got the same rude employee. Employee said he still wouldnt get a manager but eventually gave in after declaring that the manager probably would refuse to talk to G. The manager did come on the line and when G explained what had happened the Manager (THE MANAGER!?) told G that it is a store policy that if an employee determines that a customer is out of line rude etc that they have sole authority to have them removed from the premises.   What kind of BS is this? Apparently at Sears Parts & Repair the customer is always WRONG.   It is amazing to me that after all the money we have dropped in Sears that not only did this kind of disrespectful thing happen but that the Manager actually claims this is ok and store policy. Really? Store policy?  I will be writing a formal complaint to Sears Corp and see what they think of this ridiculous store policy.',1
'Ive been to this Pita Jungle MANY times. In fact every weekend I go here for one thing and one thing only... the berry iced tea mixed with lemonade. If I could rate Pita Jungle solely on that I would give them a 5+++ stars however I cannot but you should definitely try one-it will rock your world.   Heres the thing... what I usually get to eat here I do like but I can never get anything different because the menu just doesnt appeal to me. The items are just not quite what I am ever looking for ever. I will say that their roasted red pepper hummus and grilled chicken are great. I also have enjoyed the spinach quesadilla and taziki but other than that I find the food and service to be mediocre. That being said I do frequent here often for a healthy meal and to support a local business over the many chain restaurants in this area.   And...Thats all I have to say about that.',3
'I LOVE this place!! Such a cool unique vibe.  I love the assortment of broths (if you like hot get the tom yum or house spicy).  The choice of veggies and meats is extensive.  I always wind up having to google some of the menu items! This place is great for adventurous eaters.  AWESOME for groups!',5
'Service was not good they forgot about us after our dinner was served. Chips tasted stale.',1
'Went with my husband and kids for the first time and loved this place.  The food was amazing.   We had the stuffed shells stuffed chicken and lemon chicken scampi type dish with capers (forgot name).  So good!   I will definitely have my company Christmas party here this year.',5
'Rokerij is our never-fail for great food a relaxed cozy and unique experience just for two or for a group of good friends. The small bites plates are great to pass around or if you just feel like grazing for your entire meal. Crab Louie salad is unreal - big enough to share. Fish specials are always tasty with well paired seasoning chutney or sauces. The meat options are plentiful and hearty. We always have great service and a fantastic dining experience. One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Phoenix!',5
'I enjoy this place! I mean really how can you not!  They have meat they have bread and they have cheese! WIN WIN!   I like the variety of sandwiches and I love that they also have pizzas which my kids love!   If you are in a hurry downtown and need a quick and simple place to eat this is it!!',4
'First time visitor: Found via yelp.Isnt it always the way. Just as we found somewhere fun to eat for breakfast  along comes something shinier  newer and  a wee bit less crazier than Ottos mountains of food.  Coffee is much better than the dishwater Ive been getting at many morning places too.  I love the choice given for filling up the breakfast burrito   In my case a Chorizo mushroom and Jalapeno and a choice of cheese plus the usual suspects. Not greasy not anything other than  great and a reasonable size to be filling yet not require an extended nap for the remainder of the day.  Hashbrowns are kinda bland nicely crisped but lacking in anything underneath. The corned beef hash was good didnt appear overly salty and mixed in nicely with ketchup (blasphemy:) )   Service wise Heather was a whirlwind of courteous timely service as were all the people we interacted with.  Seriously the public intensity Ive only seen in Waffle houses without the accompanying ear crushing cacophony of shouted orders and plate clacking. Only bringing this up since others have made it a negative point  and I stress Ive only been here once to date.   This is easily worth 15 mins wait for  on a Sat Morning for the adherence to your order speed and quality of the food that comes out.   Does not take Amex.  - 1/2 star hash browns bland  in the middle -1/2 star',4
'The salmon was great. They overcooked my husbands steak which was just a so-so steak. City hall is much preferred!',2
'Having spent a couple of years living in Texas Ive had my share of barbecue.  So when Stacys Smokehouse was recommended for lunch today I wondered how it would stack up.  All in all it lived up to my high expectations.  The BBQ beef was tender and the sauce was just the right level of tangy.  The onion rings were great and I was surprised to see Red Beans and Rice offered on the menu which made a tasty (albeit caloric and unnecessary) addition to the meal.  No need to travel to the Lone Star State for good barbecue.  Theyre serving it up right here on Indian School Road.',4
'We got a to go order for alfredo and spaghetti. The amount of sauce they put in the food was a joke. It literally tasted like noodles with a hint of sauce. We couldnt even save our leftovers because there wasnt enough sauce to save the noodles from becoming dried out and crunchy in the microwave. When a place is charging $15 a plate for a basic pasta dish then they need to step it up a notch. Id love to think this was a one off situation but its not. Oh and if you try to ask for more sauce (ie the normal portion) theyll try to charge you.',1
'This is an interesting sandwich place that I have tried a few times. The sandwiches are pretty good but the prices seem a little expensive to me for what it is. I like their brownies but the cookies werent all that good. It can take awhile to get your sandwich as the line didnt move very fast when I was there. The employees are friendly though and that makes for a pleasant experience.',3
'Love this place! Has the freshest tasting juice that is cold pressed and knowledgeable people to help you with a cleanse or just a kick start to a healthier life!  I spent quite some time there the other day just talking with Alexandra!  I came in just before closing and wanted to start a cleanse the next day.  They were basically out of juices so instead of having me come back when they opened the next day she told me to just come back later that night when they were done juicing and she would help me pick out juices to make a great cleanse!  Needless to say all of their juices taste amazing!  Its kind of pricey but definitely worth it!',5
'They have such a great and friendly team at Speedpro Imaging of Mesa-Gilbert! You can never go wrong with Speedpro!',5
'Never can one judge a restaurant by its exterior.  Whether that makes sense or not if you ever drive south on 16th street just south of Camelback you will see a small dive bar that says Harveys. This place makes one feel like you got off a DeLorean when you walk in with that old 70s feel.  The wooden panels the old Budweiser signs and yes that cheers like feel with regulars.   They have good drink specials like 2 dollar Pbrs but if you are like me and need a quick lunch bite come in for a burger.  They only have about 3 burgers and they are cheese regular and I believe a double.  They are delicious and taste like a good homemade burger.   They have happy hour weekly and on weekends but weekends they go a tad longer. The 6 dollar burger with fries and a drink is my bag.',5
'If I was a rich daddys girl with daddys black credit card and little/no real creativeism then I would be in heaven at this place. I adore EVERYTHING in this store they have cornered the best buyers in corporate america. They have such cute household items canvas photos quirky books accessories and clothing. The big downside is everything is beyond marked up. Goodness $65 dollars for a plain faded purple flowy shirt? Again if I had a a rich daddys black credit card Id hoard everything in this store because despite it being run by corporate America they know whats going on. Many of the items you may find in regular thift shops for under $7 dollars. Because of the fact that I work for my own money I cannot give this place 5 stars because I will walk in with $200.00 and come out with three plain items :( Also I will probably see those three items repeatedly worn by underage wannabe indie kids hanging at the corner smoking their mothers cigarettes trying a bit to hard to be cool. Then I will toss whatever item we had in common and be haunted by the awful memory..',4
'Holy smokes this place rocks!  I am vegan and as soon as I heard that Z Pizza offers the new Daiya vegan cheese I rushed right over.  I chose the create your own option and got a pizza with extra vegan cheese avocado and serrano peppers.  All I can say is wow!  The vegan cheese was melted to perfection the crust was heavenly and there were just the right amount of toppings.  Even my husband a non-vegan liked it.  The next week I went back and got another vegan pizza.  I also picked up a Tuscan Mushroom (with real mozzarella) for my husband.  He could not stop saying Damn this is good.    Z Pizza has all the standard pizzas (pepperoni sausage and mushroom etc.) but they also have some really unusual pizzas (Thai Santa Fe Greek).  Also their mozzarella cheese is made from hormone free part-skim Wisconsin milk.  The prices are a little higher than pizzas you can get with a coupon at Pizza Hut Papa Johns etc. but the quality makes up for it.',5
'I cant tell you for sure.  It may be that this place isnt that great.  But since I basically just *completed* over a cupcake I think that five stars is the least i could do.  Im gonna tell you a secret--if you follow @sprinkles on twitter they sometimes have secret codes you can whisper to them to get a free cupcake.  Today it was a free red velvet for the first 25 ppl that came in and whispered 3.  So in order to prevent myself from going there every morning when they open and getting a free cupcake I will tell you all the little secret.  (It only works if you are also following @spirit_fingers)  Today an enchanting girl (the most enchanting of the five enchanting girls there) told me that I would be a fool to not get the pumpkin cupcake with cinnamon cream cheese icing.  I love pumpkin more than pretty much anything but goddamn is their red velvet cupcake (cream cheese icing) good.  So i didnt know which to get (at this point didnt realize the red velvet was a door prize) and finally settled on the pumpkin (mainly because of her brown eyes).  (not really.  food before hoes or whatever the saying is)  as I unwrapped the pumpkin cupcake I felt the surge of anticipation familiar to teenagers everywhere.  every scent struck me where it counts.  every soft moist hunk of delightfulness made me weak.  Im mixing my metaphors and its confusing me.  The pumpkin anyway was ridiculous.  So fucking good.  You owe it to the fat person in you to go there and get some cupcakes stat.',5

'This Dos Gringos is definitely by far my favorite one of the several they have in the valley. Although it is in Scottsdale and Im surrounded by Sdale douchebagery I have always had a great time here. I dont care if Im packed in here like a can of sardines the sights make up for it if you know what I mean he he. Whether its day drinking or out at night. The food is actually really good reasonably priced and great portions. There will be many more drunken adventures at this establishment for sure!!',5
'This is a great place to start the night.  Its a very casual and low key place to hang out.  You can go outside and play corn hole or hang inside and play some pool in the back room.  They play good music and I like the vibe here.  The service has always been good even for big groups.    They have a great happy hour for drink and food specials.  I usually drink wine or beer on special and have enjoyed their chicken tenders bacon macaroni and cheese and nachos.  All were excellent!',5
'The building ambiance and interior are gorgeous warm and relaxing. Its a much cozier restaurant than the old Houstons on Camelback.  The menu is much the same thankfully.  We started out with the grilled artichoke and it was good (its not on the menu) but I think the grilled artichokes at Wallys and North are better. We had a party of 7 and 3 people ordered the French Dip Sandwich with fries. Their fries are killer (really thin and yummy) and everyone seemed pleased with the sandwich (at $17 or $18 I wouldnt think of it). Two in our party had the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad ($16) and I was tickled when I tasted it (still a salad for $16...NOPE!). I ordered the Smoked Salmon starter as my entree ($12) and had a side of their braised red cabbage with goat cheese (to-die-for at any cost). The salmon was okay but I personally think it needs to be smoked a little longer... All in all its a good restaurant with impeccable service.  Still those prices seem a little steep to me....',4
'Ive yet to visit a Fox restaurant that I didnt like and Culinary Dropout is no different. The laid-back cool feel eerily good looking staff and funky decor make for a fun Happy Hour or dinner spot in Scottsdale. As usual everything is tasty and starting with the pretzel bread fondue will not disappoint. Burgers salads...all the entrees are sturdy and good but the stars are really the appetizers and the drinks. Feeling adventurous (or cheap)? Get the paper bag special...a mystery cheap beer served in a tiny can-sized paper bag.',4
'This one is a great neighborhood bar.  After moving away a few years ago I dont feel nearly as at home here anymore (not to mention its the type of bar best walked to from the nearby neighborhood) but its good to see that they still have the classic juke box and usually have plenty of open pool tables.  Great place to relax over a beer.',4
'The Grind. Zinburger. Delux... Those are some of the best burgers Ive found here in the Valley.  Indulge isnt one of them. Not by a long shot.  The menu boasts natural hormone free beef and you can build your own burger with various buns cheeses sauces meats and toppings. However if the cook cannot deliver a burger ordered medium temperature why bother with the bragging?  Seriously...both burgers were well done dry and tasteless..  Skip this place and head towards Camelback Road in East Phoenix...the best burgers inthe valley are there not here...',2
'I had lunch here today with 3 friends and was very pleased. This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant and I would return.  We had the Reuben sandwich chicken quesedilla Gobbler sandwich (turkey) and grilled cheese.  The 3 sandwiches all came with very tasty fries. The sandwiches were all huge no scrimping here!  The prices were roughly $8.00 per entree and judging from the size of the plate you receive well worth the money.  They were very busy for a Tuesday lunch but there were plenty of staff so we were well treated!',3
'I love this place for a lot of reasons that are important to me. I will try to put it into words here.   Lets start with the friendly staff. Everyone from the front desk to the housekeeping to the groundskeepers stops to say hello or good morning..   The rooms are spacious probably about 30% larger than an average hotel room.  This would be a great choice for several people sharing a room.    Decor is a tad dated but it didnt matter to me at all.  The linens were quality and everything was immaculate so the flowery bed drape almost went unnoticed. Toiletries are citrusy and fun.  Rooms have a mini-bar kind of area with a bar sink a locked minifridge and several overpriced snacks.  As well they have a safe.  I think the three things I really wanted that they didnt have were fridge microwave and FREE wi-fi ($12.95 to connect!!  No thanks I will use my iPhone).    The grounds are spacious and beautiful and green. This is a fantastic place for a family; I saw parents playing ball with kids homeschooling in the yard and just relaxing and having fun.  I went for several walks around the grounds. The casitas are adorable and homey and if I were staying for longer than just a few days I would stay in one.   While I didnt use it I stopped in to have a look at the fitness center and it is updated with lots of workout options.  Best part?  Is open 24 hours!!  Yes!  This is handy information for the future.   Four or five pools on the property; I tried two of them.  Since I am not a fan of other peoples kids I opted for the Villa Pool as it is basic rectanglar and has no toys or sprays around. I was able to read 1.5 books and soak up some rays.  Several restaurant options on the property but I can only comment on JDs which I have reviewed seperately.   And now my favorite part of staying here!  Back behind the resort is the town of Paradise Valley. Each morning I went for a long run through the neighborhoods up into the mountains (on the roads up into the mountains that is).  I do not know how to explain the exhileration of blue skies gorgeous scenery and just overall happiness I felt when I ran here.   Scottsdale Plaza may not be the fanciest most upscale most sophisticated place to stay but it fit my needs perfectly and I will be happy to return!',5
'Great Area horrible service and hotel overall.  I was transferred to Scottsdale for work and put up in this place.  Thank goodness the area is amazing with scottsdale quarter and kierland or I would have been in hell.  Room was okay but clearly worn.  The kitchen area tile was stained.  I get people use it but come on.    The absolute worse part was on day 5 of my month long stay I began to experience severe coughing attacks only in the room.  I have never had allergies but thought it was due to the change in climate.  This trend continued for the next couple days and I woke up with bites all over my knees and legs.  I ended up on day 9 or 10 needing to go to the local emergency room due to breathing issues.  I was told they believed the bites were from spiders and breathing was a reaction to something in the room.    When I got home I stripped the bed to see if there were bugs or anything and found the pad had a hole in it and was stained followed by the mattress having a huge stain.   When I got back from work the next day I went to the front desk and was told there was nothing the guy could do because no one was there to clean or a manager but hed leave a note.  I go back the next day nothing had been done spoke to a different guy and was told the same thing.  By this point Im thinking hey could I just change rooms to see what the deal is.  Suffice to say nothing came of this.  I just went to work and tried to avoid the room as much as possible.  Let me add just a minor thing the internet was incredibly unreliable which really sucked since I wanted to stay busy when I had to be in the room.  The only positive experience related to the room was the lady who checked me in and out only saw her these two times and wish I could have dealt with her the entire time.  I let my company know and I warn everyone to stay away.  Yes its cheap for such an awesome area but i dont think it is worth it.  I was in Room 111 by the way a handicap accessible room since I believe it was what was available when I checked in.',1

'This place is great the atmosphere is swanky old school style-- if you have ever been to LA and have gone to this great 30s style bar called The Edison or the fine dining place in Seattle called 13 Coins this place is right on par with that cool style.  I thought they offered a full menu for dinner buuuuut they dont.  I went here for an anniversary so dinner would have been nice but the appetizers were really good!  We had the flatbread pizza and it was soooooo good (really cheesy though so if youre not a cheese person then pass on it)  the filet bites were really great and I recommend them!  We didnt have the swedish meatballs but just so you know you only get four per order so theyre not good for sharing with a large group.  The shrimp cocktail was good but they went a little overboard with the horseradish in the cocktail sauce-- I love horseradish and it was a little much for me.  It was like if you wanted to get the taste of the cocktail sauce the horseradish accosted your sinuses and if you tried to not get as much horseradish in your face you couldnt taste the cocktail sauce! Oy.  The drinks were GREAT.  GREAT.  I had a white russian and my boyfriend had a vodka martini and both were perfect.  PERFECT.  And strong so try and take a taxi instead of driving no one wants to hang out at Sheriff Joes tent city in pink underwear...',4
'This was my rebound dinner after a horrible first experience at Whataburger. What-a-difference.  The carne asada and pollo were delicious but the barbacoa was kinda eh.  And what was the story with the salsas? Theyre set out on the three shelves of a rolling cart some low enough that you have to crouch down to serve yourself. I realize that you guys were near closing but thats just too close to the floor for my taste.  The salsa thing puts em at risk for loosing a star but after such horrible food at Whataburger this place tasted like food from Heaven.  2013 #3 / 365',4
'Rocket Fizz is an awesomely nostalgic candy/soda store! I just went in there to browse around but ended up getting a whole bunch of candy that I used to eat as kid. I even saw a pack of Big League Chew...wth I thought they stopped making that? They also have a huge assortment of bottled soda so be sure to ask the super nice person at the register for soda punch card.   This is a great place to pick up novelty candies or even just to have a look around. Even more awesome Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was playing on the TV.',5
'Simple! 1) Rude Staff 2) High Prices (Double in some cases) 3) Pretty much no return policy which really pisses me off. When you go some where specifically to get fitted for shoes and they do it incorrectly then you cant return them! Really! BAD BUSINESS ALL AROUND!',1

'For never actually spending time in Phoenix I spend so much time in this airport.  When you live in and are flying out of a small town that nobody has ever heard of its a chore getting home to Hawaii for me. Phoenix is always my layover or one of my layovers. I always feel like Ive ran a marathon by the time Im at my next gate. Its so spread out and huge and just my luck I always need to be at the opposite end of where Im at to catch my connecting flight.  Those people mover things do help though until people decide to stand on it because legs are overrated. Thats just lazy come on!  Something Ill remember forever; I was so thirsty so I went to a Starbucks in my terminal.  I ordered a black tea.  When the lady called my name and gave me my drink I was in such a hurry..I grabbed it and went on my way to board. I never took my first sip until seated on the plane.  Ahhh finally relaxation time.  I take a huge sip expecting deliciously fresh brewed iced tea and NOPE. Pure black iced coffee. Not even a hint of cream or sugar. The guy in front of me is lucky I didnt spit it out. Did I mention that Im not even a coffee drinker? My husband had a huge laugh.  Haha I guess. Lol.',3
'Paradise Juice is a lunchtime jewel sequestered away from the street in a strip mall full of giant  chain stores. Ok that was a bit dramatic but we who have spent enough time in Phoenix know that strip malls often house great food finds and we must educate outsiders not to discriminate based on appearances. Paradise Juice is really good...seriously. And its healthy!  This little spot is owned and operated by an Iranian family that is just so genuinely nice youll feel good giving them your business. All of their smoothies are amazing and made with fresh ingredients. Try the cranberry-based ones for something less sweet or opt for a delicious vegetable juice. If you need food on top of your liquid meal I especially love the grilled vegetable sandwich. There are a few nice outdoor tables albeit your view is a massive parking lot.',4

'As a replacement for the Library bar this place is bad. Poor service rven when it is not busy however the ladies whom may or not be blonde are typically ASU attractive. Food on two occasions is bland. Ceasar chicken wrap the deep fried breading tasted like the oil was old they just slap some small chunks of chicken on a tortilla add some tasteless dressing and serve. The hot wings are anything but.',2

'this is a very cool concept. the movie/grill/bar idea is new and exciting. i was definitely looking forward to it. first of all i got a good deal through Groupon. adult tix are 9 bucks and i got for 5 plus a free drink so score there. i went to serf ghost protocol ay 125pm so there werent very many people. the bar is in the lobby if u want to order drinks there but you can order them in the theater as well. the theatre was clean which i liked. my wife and i sat in chairs with a school-like desk attached to it. the chairs were quite comfy. there is also another section with office like chairs so if you arrive soon enough you can avoid.those. while the pre show and trailers played the friendly staff took your order. the food arrived promptly and was very delicious (we.both ordered a turkey burger which came with sweet potato fries... yum ). at any time throughout the film if you needed anything you can push a red button on your chair to call an attendant. they arrived after a couple of minutes and filled my drink.   all in all the experience was very pleasant. i didnt mind so much the staff coming up to me during the film with my order because after all i did place it. but if you are the kind of person that dislikes interruptions during a movie this place may not be for you. also we watched an early afternoon showing and had good service. i can only imagine if the theatre was full (say a movies opening weekend) and the service quality dropped. it is overpriced for the food and drink so i suggest either eating and drinking before hand or if you dont mind dropping some cash then go ahead and treat yourself.',4
'We have eaten here 5 times over the last 30 years -- the first 25 of these I was living in Los Angeles and would come in with relatives who lived in Chandler. The last 5 years weve seen a steady improvement in the decor and atmosphere but the same exceptionally prepared dishes that I enjoyed on the first visit. We love the bean dip salsa and endless chips that precede the main course. Weve tried the fajitas and various combinations of enchiladas tamales chili rejano that were just delicious -- spicy enough without overpowering the slow-cooked meaty aromatic qualities of this food prepared the way it was originally intended. Never a bad experience with the food. One visit was a little noisy from one child sitting in the booth next to ours who sounded like a whole group of kids yelling at once. Besides that weve always had a great time truly attributed to the great service and friendly servers.',4
'Very upscale decor and big room for lots of folks to drink and eat in.  The food was good but all we had were appetizers and drinks late at night..but they were yummy. Some really good R&B entertainment when they have it so try and book during that time.  Set a great mood for the place with the mellow sound coming from the group.',4

'I give Thai Rama 3.5 stars.  A couple of weeks ago my Denver friend was still in town and we really like Thai. Had been searching for Thai Elephant because of yelp reviews but gave up and got desperate and actually located Thai Rama.  The servers were all clearly ASU students and several were working on homework. We came in at a really random pre-dinner hour on a Sunday so we were the only people there but that was alright.  Prices were reasonable and service was obviously fast... however I was deciding between the yellow and panang curry chose the yellow eventually but was served the panang.  Its okay though because it was truly delicious... but she didnt really listen to me.  My curry was substantially better than my friends pad thai which was very hot as she requested (two-star thai hot) but kind of had a strange flavor different than other pad thai we have tasted.  It wasnt awful by any stretch but paled in comparison to my awesome panang curry.  The flavor was second to none and panang curry is one of my favorite comfort foods.  The restaurant itself wasnt special though the ambiance wasnt too bad.  Id come back for an inexpensive date night or to have a quick bite with my friends... not to impress any Thai connoisseurs though.',3

'This location opened up just 3 weeks ago and offers high quality natural products for mainly cats and dogs although there is a very basic small animal section.  The emphasis is on foods that are more nutritious healthier and that dont have corn or soy in them. There is a large freezer section in the back with a good selection of raw food meals.  Also there is a plethora of treats and toys for your furry friend as well.  The small animal foods section has a few small bags of hay some treats pellets and toys.  I wasnt too impressed with their rabbit selection and they did not offer high quality brands such as Oxbow which is a bit surprising since they have so many high quality dog and cat products.  Jill the manager was very enthusiastic and is very passionate about providing the best products for pets.  She showed me various treats foods and toys and provided a lot of educational material on dog nutrition and health.  She provided a free sample of some nice grain-free dry dog kibble which is highly recommended on dogfoodadvisor.com which I appreciated a lot since my dog is a bit picky with the food he eats.  This is definitely a place to go to spoil and pamper your dog or cat!',5
'I found this company on Superpages.com where they had 5 stars. They provided the very best pool cleaning bid for our HOA and included more frequent services than the other companies who bid.

This is a reliable small business that really cares about their work!',5
'Ive been to this locations tons of times before and never had a problem always had good service and food had been perfect. Tonight unfortunately wasnt the case as my boyfriend and I decided it was a good idea to go in and have a appetizer night (Our usual onion sting and triple dipper to share) at around 8:30. We were seated quickly and was approached by a waiter within the first 5 minutes of sitting down. We decided on our drinks and I was given a regular lemonade instead of the usual strawberry lemonade my boyfriend had ordered for me. The waiter was soon back to change that when we pointed out the small mistake. We ordered our food (triple dipper with  regular big mouth bites potato skins and honey chipotle crispers and our onion strings). Didnt see our waiter for a good 10 minutes after that until he bought my boyfriend another drink in which he soon hurried back away from our table and on to the bar area. Another what seemed like 15 minutes passed and our food finally arrived put on the table and the waiter was gone once again. Unfortunately we received the new guacamole big mouth bites (We dont eat guacamole) potato skins were warm in the middle but beginning to go cold on the outside but the crispers were  hot enough to actually have to blow on before eating. The onion strings were kind of cold and the batter was flaking off the onions (Ive never had this happen before?). We waited a good 5 minutes for our waiter to come back and check on us to see if everything was ok but he never arrived. After 10 minutes we decided to start eating what we had as we were very hungry to begin with. We didnt see our waiter again until he came over to clean up our plates and give us the check. Im not one to normally complain but we didnt really have a chance to complain to start with tonight. The waiter was very bland and didnt really want to deal with us to begin with never took the time to listen to our complete order or check in on us. We had cold-ish food and just wanted to leave once the check came to the table. I will probably have to keep close to home from now on and eat at the surprise location I know what kind of service I will be receiving from there.',2

'Dont come here after 9pm to have a nice dinner. That was around the time the bar gets hopping...with old people. They were loud and took away from the restaurant experience. Luckily for them the food saved them on this review. The main course was good and so was the tiramisu. The bread was good but they dont give you much. The kind they give you comes with a olive oil type butter that was interesting and pretty good.',3

'We stayed in the king suite for our one night getaway as the grandparents watched the kiddo.  What a nice treat it was!  Beware the hotel is very steep in areas.  It is built on a mountain after all.    Service was good.  Hotel room was huge but definitely needs updating.  The wallpaper in the bathroom was falling off and considering how expensive ($300/nt!) it was I was expecting a nicer tub/shower.  Its like the typical showers you see in motels.  Not impressive at all.  Other than that though we really enjoyed our stay here.  We came off-peak so a lot of their amenities were not available to us but that wasnt a big deal for us.  It was a nice way to reboot for the hubby and I.',4
'Awesome Irish pub. Great pub food and pub atmosphere. Very reasonable prices.',4
'One Saturday evening my bf and I checked out Wildfish for the first time. It was late and had to get dinner before work so we were looking for something quick. We immediately got seats at the bar and were greeted by Jessie the bartender. He was very helpful in choosing the wine to pair with the oysters and truffle mac & cheese. He also was very attentive and gave really great service. We ordered a dozen of oysters and they tasted like they came straight from the sea so fresh! The truffle mac & cheese was soooo good! perfect balance between the truffle and cheese. Their manager Tommy was very hospitable and engaging. The restaurant is fine dining. The staff warms the place and are very hospitable. Working in the hospitality industry is sometimes like a curse cause you cant help but notice service defects and food quality. My experience so far in Arizona when it comes to hospitality has not been that great. There are a handful of places that I have been to that are up to par with service and food but Wildfish stood out among the rest. Superb amazing service and fresh seafood flown in daily. It may be a $$$ restaurant but it well worth visiting often if you want to enjoy fresh seafood with classic american dishes w/ a flare.',5
'I am new to Arizona and was looking for a place to get my hair cut. Im telling you I had a hair emergency!  Coming from a small town where there was no good place to get a good hair cut it had been awhile! I found most places dont like to deal with a female that just wants a cut and not color as there is not as much $$ to be made. Thats how it was where I came from anyways. Also had enough bad cuts in the last several years to leave me paranoid. The first thing I did was check Yelp and found Vega Salon to have great reviews. No big bells and whistles to leave me intimidated on the first visit. I actually got an appt. that very day and got Julie. I will never have to look again. She was ready the minute I walked in. A very good start!  She asked me exactly what I wanted. I have very fine hair and I realize its hard to work with. I said I needed it cut for some volume. But did ask to PLEASE not cut it short. I dont have the face for shortshort hair and that had been a problem in the past. It takes real long for it to grow back as well. I also said I do need a color but after summer as the pool water would just ruin it. She was not pushy at all and agreed it would be best to wait. She continued to ask about the lengths she was needing to cut. I realized that I would lose a bit of length due to the lack of trimmings in the past. In 30 mins. She had washed cut and blow dried my hair exactly how I wanted it. No chatter on the phone or stopping to chat with others (huge plus) kept a polite conversation with me the entire time but not over bearing and allowed me to relax. I was charged $25 and found it more then fair. I did wish I knew I needed to ask to have my hair style (extra charge) I would have happily paid but was still very satisfied. She gave me a pamphlet of all the salons menu and fees. I left feeling beautiful with a healthy head of hair. Best of all my husband LOVED the cut and said it made me look younger. I will be returning at the end of summer for a color. Great place!',5

'I normally wouldnt even think to review a Walmart store because historically Ive DESPISED them!  But recently I discovered a Walmart - This Walmart - And have had a change of heart (so to speak).  I find this Walmart to be free from Walmartians (or at least I havent witnessed any while Ive been in there) and the staff is actually helpful and pleasant....Thats right you read that correctly....Helpful and pleasant - They dont appear to DESPISE their jobs and lives as much as I use to despise Walmart as law.  Additionally I find this store to be quite clean and well stocked with inventory which is a bonus!  So there you have it.....A Walmart store within the State of Arizona which is acceptable and not a challenge to even think about entering into.   Happy Shopping!',3

'This place has been fantastic! What a perfect find. Being newer to the Valley finding a vet I can trust that treats me and my pup right is important! From the minute I called to schedule a new patient appointment I could tell that I was going to receive fantastic service. My wellness visit being a new patient was 1/2 off for first one and I met with Dr. Graham. He has been a fantastic vet to have so far! I was reluctant to get my dog spayed unsure if it was the right thing. Havent found a place I was comfortable with the vet and the price. Luckily if its needed Dobson Ranch is more than happy to make payment accomidations. Never throughout my appointments have I felt pressured into things I dont need or treated rudely if I refused certain vaccinations. Another cool thing they set up this site called Petly which is online and allows you to monitor all of your pets vaccinations next appointment dates etc online. Pretty nifty. Finally made the decision to have my girl spayed. First time Ive ever had a pet go through this surgery and had to deal with post-surgical care. Dr. Graham met with me about 4 days after cause I had concerns and they immediately got me in and didnt charge me extra to check up on it. Everything is going great and will be going in for the final follow-up appointment next week! Would highly recommend them for anyone!',5
'We are always looking for a great breakfast spot to enjoy a good cup of java and flavorful food.  Orange Table will be in my top two breakfast joints.  Relaxed atmosphere cool place to ride your bicycle too and eat on the patio.  I would recommend to anyone.    I had the butter milk pancakes with sausage and my wife had bacon potatoes and an English muffin.  The coffee was perfect  very smooth not bitter.',4
'Subway is better any day!',1
'I have done quite a bit of camping at Usery the last couple years. I am currently camping there for a two week time frame. In the past never had any problems while being there it is a very beautiful campground. This year though I have been what I consider harassed by some new hosts.   First day showed up at 1:00pm (on the dot) to check in. The gate was closed and nobody there. So I waited 8 minutes for someone to show up but when they didnt I called the reservation number to inquire about what was going on. The person I spoke to told me to go to the Nature Center and she could give me my tags. That all happened and was at my site with the tag on my mirror and on the clamp at entrance to the campsite. I was there about 30 minutes and I guy pulled in in a pickup truck. He just sat there staring at me. I figured something was up so I walked up to speak with him. He had a scowl on his face and didnt even say hi the first words out of his mouth were How long you been here? I said Just shortly after check in. He asked were I got the tags. I told him the story. He then said Oh yeah what was the womans name you spoke with? I said I dont know her name but she had blond hair and about this tall. - raising my hand up to a level about as tall as she was. He said Alright your okay. Give me the red reservation tag on the post. In a kind of demanding voice. I walked over to the post and brought it back and handed it to him.   The next day I was pulling in through the check in gate and stopped rolled down my window and told him I was on my way to my campsite. He said in a gruff voice I know you have a sticker dont you. and pointed at the sticker on my mirror. I said Yeah thanks have a good one.  The next time I happened by this guy again was pulling into the park again at the check in gate. There was a motorcycle talking to them in line so I waited until they were done and started through driving maybe 1 mph stopped below the window and he was gazing down at me and I nodded then drove off. I looked in my back windows and his head was sticking out the window looking at me as I drove away. After about 10 minutes later back at my camp he pulls up and parks his truck in front of my campsite. I was still in my car at the time. He stomps up to my window and I roll down my window. He asked him if there was a problem. He asked if I just went through the gate and I said I had. He said he didnt see my sticker. I said it is right here and pointed to it hanging on my mirror. He asked me if I saw the truck on my right. I said no. He said Okay well your fine. and walked back to his truck and left.  After all this with this guy I was a little fuming. Felt compelled to go talk to him to find out what the issue is with me he has. I went back to the gate and told him my experience. In a calm voice. His wife was there also and she said Well you breezed through here so we didnt have time to see your sticker. I told her flatly that I didnt not breeze through here and that I had stopped at the stop sign. She said well we cant see your sticker from there. Note the stop sign is about 5 feet past the window. I said No I stopped below the window at the stop sign.   I have 10 days left on my reservation at the park. I feel like a prisoner in a jail the way I have been treated up till this point. It is a shame that I have to watch my back like I feel I have to at this point. These two hosts have ruined the park for me. Not worth feeling like this all the time I stay there ruins the whole experience. I will not be coming back to park again.',2
'The Simple Farm has been a blessing to our neighborhood and to the local farm movement.  It simply doesnt get any fresher or any better. Thank you to Lylah and Michael and to farm manager Anita and to our beautiful wonderful goats - Lavender Miss Storm Sweet Marie and Baby Ani for enriching our lives and help us in our quest to  improve our health.  I love watching The Simple Garden grow.',5
'I went to Creations and Alterations because of high Yelp reviews and they didnt let me down!  Friendly service.  They sewed on a botton in just a few minutes and I was out of there.  $3.  Ill be back for their friendly and quick service.',5
'Terrible terrible customer service. We wont be back.',1
'Almost as good as the original Boomers.  Wasnt quite there for me but maybe because I was there on a Sunday and the help clearly wasnt into working that day.  Cant say I blame them though.  Anyways same good menu selections good prices.  Sliders were tasty but not as good as at the original Boomers.      Needless to say Ill be back and try them again.  These guys have awesome Chicago dogs and it would be a shame not to try them here!',4
'Today I met a friend at Padres for lunch. First off I have to give a shout out to those working the patio today. Wow - exceptional customer service. Several people came by our table including the owner to refill drinks and check on us. They were smiley and personable. We started with salsa and chips. Growing up in NM all restaurants serve chips and salsa at no cost. It is always hard for me to break open the wallet for this however today I arrived early and I was really hungry. The mild and medium salsas were bland however the spicy salsa hit the spot. Some ladies to the side of us ordered the queso with chorizo. I was quite jealous as I heard them oohing and ahhing over the appetizer. I ordered the fish tacos and my friend had the chicken tacos. Both were yummy and reasonably priced. Off their special lunch menu beans and rice are extra. Again I am not used to having to pay extra for these. On the plus side they were very good. Its been a few years since I went visited this place and Im pretty sure Ill be going back sooner than later. Especially to sit on the nice patio outside during the cool Phoenix months.',4
'Never have I been disappointed here.  I like to sit at the sushi bar and watch as the chefs put together some of the prettiest and tastiest sushi I could imagine eating in a desert.    Seriously pulling off great sushi in the Phoenix area seems like a great challenge... this place does a great job.  Theyre sometimes one of the only places that have toro in the area as well - a personal favorite.  You should ask though because its pretty rare.   Finally the mushroom miso soup is very very tasty and a nice way to kick off a visit.  I also recommend the sake based cocktails.',4
'Heyyyyyy its a Starbucks! Its right by my house so its convenient.   This location is like all the other locations. The coffee is pretty good those little breakfast sandwiches are really good and its busy as hell almost all the time. I can walk from my apartment whenever I want so its great for a weekend morning where we really want convenient breakfast and coffee.   Service is friendly. Weve gone the last two years on Christmas morning (not traveling home has its perks) and this last year they were doing something they called pay it forward. In essence each person in line contributes to the person behind them. My wife and I had about $10 put toward our order and we decided to pay for the coffee for the guy in line behind us. It was a small thing but a nice gesture and in keeping with the spirit of the holiday.   For the other 364 days a year again its a Starbucks. You know what youre getting and youll be satisfied.',3
'Tanzy is a great option for a nice dinner special occasion or night out.  Ive been there a few times for dinner each time being a celebration.  I opted for Tanzy on my own birthday when asked to choose a restaurant.  I havent tried many of their cocktails but the few I have tasted were top notch.  I hear they have a great happy hour.  I know they have a great wine list and you can see their collection of bottles in one of the unique walls around the room.  As far as non-alcoholic beverages go their iced tea is fruity but not too sweet and pleases our resident tea-lover of the group.    For an appetizer you cant go wrong with the table-side mozzarella.  A very knowledgeable cheese artist (not sure if thats an official title) comes by and entertains with cheesy skills and the occasional cheesy joke.  The cheese itself served with prosciutto and figs or pesto and tomatoes and adorned with one or two of your choice of gourmet salts never disappoints.  Nobody has yet to order an entree that didnt wow but I have to say the short ribs are particularly popular.    Service is always excellent and I think we talk about the decor with every visit.  Atmosphere and attitude top off this experience like the cherry in the Brownie Sundae (although the red velvet bread pudding is my personal fave).  I cant wait to go back!',5
'What; The Fuck! There is a HUUUGE rift in the taste bud department. I really dont know how to say this without completely insulting SOME reviewers but do you have any fucking taste buds? How the hell does this shitbox get 4 solid stars and over 100 reviews?????? Please someone? This is garbage. GARBAGE. It has been awhile since Ive eaten at a chain restaurant and it will be another decade before I do again it seems. Here is what I know this is what Ive eaten.  Gnocchi w/ Sausage in a Vodka Cream Sauce. I dont care if the sausage was good or if the sauce was perfect. The Gnocchi was TERRIBLE! Gummy Dense Thick....DEES-CUSTING.  Lobster Carbonara. Overall taste was fair sauce had binded and really became bulky whilst mid pasta twist. Snap pea pods in the dish?? Peas...Definately. Pods.....way to sweet and distinct. Service was terrible.....Terrible. There are many Italian restaurants in Arizona. This so far has been the worst for me. The other 5 diners agree too. Dismal White Clam Sauce Bready Heavy meatballs Tough Raviolis. The only standout......Grilled Poundcake....It was descent.',1
'agree the tikka masala has gone a little thin in the past few months . will only go here on a lunch hour so i can order the special and get a good value. last trip 4 people had lunch and a 2 had a glass of wine and it was $ 100 since everyone ordered ala carte too steep for the amount of food you get.',3
'My husband and I went here to celebrate his birthday. The service was impeccable and the food was amazing!  We made a reservation and were seated promptly. After being seated we admired the interesting decor kind of modern meets rustic. Our server came over and I expressed to him my dairy issue he then went out of his way to check with the chef to see what could be made dairy free. He then came back a made several recommendations on what to eat. We had the following: Mussels: a generous portion in a white wine sauce with chunks of chorizo Tongue & cheek: perfectly cooked tender meat with flavorful pieces of tongue Lobster butter steak: amazing flavor and cooked very well And for dessert they gave my husband a complimentary birthday cupcake which was really good too. I would highly recommend Searsucker I cant wait to go back.',5
'1st! Its american oil!!! 2nd! Lowest price in town! 3rd! It has a car wash! 4th! Has a red box to rent movies!  Not to bad it also has most of everything that other gas station/convenient stores have!  I usually stop of here on the way to my weekend job! Get my 5 hr energy drink diet coke then Im good for the night! The only problem you might have with this location might be the construction on the 303 fwy. Lots of traffic at times.',4
'Ive been here a few times and its been a good place to bowl.  1) Its cheap. Ive been to the Brunswicks and AMFs and they are way too flashy and too expensive. This place is nice but it still feels like a bowling alley. There normal prices are very reasonable but then they always have deals on top of them ($1 Mondays!)  2) The staff is friendly 3) Bowling is fun!   Drinks arent too expensive I havent tried the food from the restaurant but it does look delicious. Definitely worth checking out.',5
'My favorite place to buy wine ever!  The selection is wonderful the prices are incredible and the staff is confident and friendly.   Ive gone on a saturday for a wine tasting and was able to learn more than I had expected in just a short amount of time.  And I even bought a couple bottles that I would have otherwise ignored.  Ill admit I did pick up a bit of a buzz from all the wine I got to taste but who doesnt love that!    I was just there yesterday with an out of town co-worker and he was also quite impressed.  One of my favorite parts of this store is the section that has the staffs picks.  If you do not know what you might like or its a winery you are just not too familiar with they give you a heads up on some of the basics.  Ive bought several bottles from that section alone!  In addition to wine they also sell other liquor pretty much any kind you can imagine and cigars as well.. I dont go there for these things.. cuz Im a wino!  haha.',5
'Ive been hitting up Video Paradise a lot again since I now have a car and getting to there from where I live in Tempe is no longer a sisyphean ordeal with all the public transportation and such.  I still think this is a wonderful place--I dunno I find local video stores with a porn section to be nostalgic and charming for some reason--but Ive been let down quite a few times recently.  I rented Night of the Iguana and about thirty minutes in it began skipping uncontrollably.  I tried it on another DVD player and in my computer and on those devices the menu wouldnt even load up.  Undertow was the exact same thing.  I got to a certain point it began to skip and then it jumped ahead about two chapters and the BAD THING that happens is involved in that scratch.  On my other player and on my computer the menu wont even load.  The Elephant Man had a scratch and about a minute of dialogue between Anthony Hopkins and a nurse is gone because of it.  In all of those cases the disc looks totally fine it just wont work.  When I returned Undertow and said it was acting up they just said okay so I didnt bother mentioning the other two movies because it didnt seem too high priority.  Some of the movies on their shelves are just gone and arent around no matter how often I check back.  A movie where Powers Boothe plays Jim Jones is just MIA.  I went to rent an old HBO show called The Hitchhiker but in its place was another horror movie called The Hitcher which is a cool flick but not what I wanted to see.  I didnt realize the mistake until I got home because of such similar titles but I definitely got The Hitcher from The Hitchhikers box and the wrong disc was in there.  The employees are all really nice and everything but man its just been frustrating.',3
'Yummy...Seafood.. This place has both seafood from the west coast and east coast..   I love their selections.. Their shrimp and lobster salad looked succulent and their Cajun gumbo was to die for..    This is the real deal if you want to eat a seafood restaurant.. Hands down one of the best seafood restaurants I have been too in a long time...  Wonderful very bright atmosphere makes you feel like your on island in the middle of the desert...hehe',5
'I called at 4:53 PM and talked to a nice lady at the office. She told me she would contact her service tech and call me back. I got a call back within 15 minutes and she told me someone would be at my house between 5 and 7 that same day.  By 5:30 Chase was here to fix my air conditioner and was out the door by 6. It was fast efficient service and they even came after their business hours. Great service and reasonable prices.',5
'I like coming here because its the only shopping center I have ever been to thats actually a park. Its very pet friendly and fitness friendly too.   Every restaurant there has good food although they are very busy so sometimes you can expect a wait.   Theres plenty of parking both self and valet covered and uncovered.  The only reason its 4 stars is that its not for everyone. Most shops are upscale and beautiful but not particularly budget friendly.  Im on the fence though because its also a park so there are plenty of free activities to do besides shop.  4.5',4
'Fox got it right again!  If youre looking for a cool trendy open/airy place to eat Zinburgers an awesome spot!  On a recent trip I had the Zinburger signature burger which was moist tender and flavorful.  Even the soft yet sturdy bun was good!  The Sweet Potato Fries came with a yummy Yogurt Dipping Sauce; totally worth the extra $5!  To drink consider the well-poured Lemon Sipper (Skyy Vodka Mint Leaves Lemonade) to cool off on a hot Phoenix day.  I ate indoors but they have a wonderful relaxing patio too.  This place is great for lunch with girlfriends after a day of shopping but equally as fitting for a Saturday night date.  Kids are welcome but theyd probably be happier at Mickey Ds down the street.',4
'We came here tonight for my birthday dinner.  It was just wonderful.  The restaurant was packed but we got a table right away.  The food was fresh and the portions were large.  We had enough leftover for several meals.  I really like this restaurant for a nicer night out.  It is a bit pricey for everyday though.',4
'I went to the Mission with a group of 7 girls. We were a large group but since it was restaurant week we thought it would not be too complicated for us all to enjoy a great meal with no issues.   The decor of this place is beautiful! It is so cool and so hip! I loved it but keep it mind it is pretty dark. There is a great little patio in the front of the restaurant a bar with some seating available and a small to medium sized main dining room.   The restaurant week menu was very enticing and I was immediately drawn to the Ahi Tuna appetizer halibut entree and churro expresso dessert. Unfortunately they were out of the Tuna (which our server did not tell us until we were all ready to order. I ended up getting the pork belly salad which was yummy but we were a little annoyed we were not told up front that the restaurant week menu was limited. But no big deal not the end of the world. We all ordered and were enjoying our cocktails when the waiter came back and said the kitchen only had two halibuts left and three of us had ordered it. It was disheartening to change my order yet again. I ended up ordering the filet. To be fair it was amazing. Whatever they put in it rub seasoning was fantastic! I just had my heart set on the tuna and the halibut. (I have been studying the menu on-line days in advance!) The three desserts: expresso churro fried bananas and pumpkin bread pudding were all OK nothing spectacular. We did get a free mini margarita with our meal but I am pretty sure there was no alcohol in it.   The staff was very polite and the place was packed. It was overall a great time but I have to go with 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 because I was forced to order things that I was not intending on having. They should be pretty stocked up considering how popular restaurant week is. Additionally if they were out of something it would have been nice if they could have offered an alternative third app.   I would go back because it was a great location nice staff cool place and really good steak!',3
'This place has been on my To Do List for some time now.  After reading the menu online I finally went there for lunch.  I ordered:  Italian Sandwich (Capicola Mortadella Pepperoni Salami & Provolone Cheese) $5 Zapps Chips $1.10 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA#jvtmuI3xq1t__d2_A0IQTA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA#fz8JYiwA92ZcW2ByFPFRVA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/potbelly-sandwich-shop-scottsdale-2?select=OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ#OwWJ9p-Aax_BDkUSVTnUJQ  There are a few things that make this sandwich shop unique: + The Bread is thinner than most (see my pics). + They offer Hot Peppers that are like Giardiniera...and theyre hot. + They have Zapps Chips...very hard to find outside of the South.  The Sandwich is toasted and is very tasty.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The Hot Peppers are legitimately spicy and add flavor to the Sandwich.  I love Zapps Chips and was very happy to see it offered here for sale.  The employees here are very friendly and helpful with making your Sandwich.  The only complaint is that when I asked for a Big sized Sandwich (30% larger according to their website) they said they dont have Big Sandwiches yet....what?  Why have it on your website then?  Logic would tell you not to post it on your website....or at least post that its coming soon.  Anyway its not the employees at the stores fault thats a corporate office problem.  The store has plenty of indoor seating and a small outdoor seating area as well.  I was there on a Saturday at 11:15 and it was pretty busy.  I would expect them to be really busy on weekdays for lunch.  Ill have to come back when they have Big Sandwich options ready.  Return Factor - 80%',4
'I have been to my fair share of theaters but this one tops the list. When I first walked in I thought I had entered a restaurant my mistake. You are greeted by a hostess who discusses the current movie choices. You then choose where you would like to sit and have the option of regular seats or the plus section. The plus section is different because the seats recline with a leg rest better view and you have a server for the duration of the feature. Unfortunately during my visit the plus section was booked so we settled for the regular seats.   I arrived a good thirty minutes before the feature started so I can explored the lobby. There was a restaurant full service bar and a concession stand. I headed towards the concession stand because I had to try out the self-service wine bar. I purchased myself a wine card and an order of truffle fries. I had myself a little tasting from a few different wineries; Joseph Phelps Chateau Montelena and settled with a glass of Silver Oak.  After grabbing my snacks I headed into the theatre and the best was yet to come. Rows of large comfortable leather seats which had tables for you to place all the goodies you just purchased. I got settled in and began to eat my fries and noticed that they had forgot to add truffles. I began to walk out when a attendant stopped me asked what the issue was and said he would take care of it and I could return to my seat. A new batch of fries were delivered shorty after and then the previews began rolling no advertisements were up on the screen before previews.   The sound and picture quality were superb. The lobby theater and restrooms were clean. Staff was friendly and knowledgable. I will definitely visit iPic again when I am in the area.  I notice some Yelpers commented on the price of a ticket. For the experience and service I felt that the cost was worth it. This chain of theaters goes above and beyond to push a good product and attracts a classy crowd. My kind of place.',5
'I came here the other night looking for beer and bar food and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was delicious from our entrees of Monte Cristo and Steak tacos right down to how the loaded fries were seasoned. Even all the sauces they give you with the tacos are awesome! It seemed like they payed attention to detail in EVERYTHING they cooked. I plan on going back to catch a game or two!',5
'Excellent service throughout meal with great tacos and house margaritas.  Free chips and salsa ( although the salsa is more liquid than most) and our meals were served hot and quick. Great flan for dessert.',4
'We bring our three sons to Dr. Hartsook!  He is the best Ped in town I would have to say! Always takes extra time to explain everything going on to us and is genuinely concerned about our children. I love that he will not only ask about their health but make sure their development is above average as well. I recommend him as a Ped to everyone!!!',5
'Just had take out after a friend offered to bring me lunch. Jerk Chicken was flavorful spicy but not too much (speaking for me but I like it HOT!) Rice and peas was a little bland and plantains were great! But why so skimpy? Maybe I am a plantain fanatic though since I can eat a massive plateful and still want more. Anywhoo I am happy to see this addition to the landscape and on this side of town open later than most simialr establishments. They offer catering as well.',3
'Im going to go out on a limb here and give Seamus McCaffrey four solid stars. Given that I dont really like pubs or pub food I think that four stars is a pretty high rating.   My rating is based on three major things about the place:   1. The outdoor smoking patio with high tables is really nice if you like to smoke when you drink. Its small but certainly serves its purpose. If you dont like being around smoke you wont agree with this reason. But you have been forewarned and you can feel free to discount my review.   2. The patrons are a really interesting mix of people. When my husband and I went for happy hour we saw business men in suits and pony-tailed t-shirt-clad bikers alike enjoying themselves and relaxing after a hard day at work.   3. Maybe I havent been too enough pubs to know any better but I really felt like this place had some heart to it--maybe not soul but certainly heart. When we went for happy hour I felt like I was hanging out somewhere that had personality (something I cant say about pretty much every other place Ive been downtown). While fun chic upscale bars have their appeal sometimes its nice to just enjoy a beverage in the comfort of a spot thats a bit more real.   Well folks these are my reasons. I fully accept that they may not appeal to you but if anything Ive said strikes a cord and youre looking for a chill place to hang out downtown check Seamus McCaffrey out.',4
'Its been like 4 months and Im still here. Extended Stay is going through a makeover and now they have new signs new staff uniforms and even a small breakfast but they still arent fixing stuff on a local hotel by hotel level. The back door lock and another lock have not worked in over a month but that is really the only compalint I could have here. The hotel does buffer an industrial zone but that only causes a few construction workers to stay here on occasion. The new breakfast is nothing you would stay here for packaged muffins and oatmeal and some coffee and a few apples. The staff is really nice though - Tammy in the AM and the Jenny at night are both top notch. The housekeepers do a good if not spotty job and i had two lightbulbs promptly replaced. Sometimes these places bring out the lowlifes but this property has remained trouble free during my time here. WAffle House is next door if your desperate for food and some places deliver but Mill and Tempe are just a short 8 minute drive away on University. After 30 days you stop paying taxes and save some cash too. The rooms at this location have also been remodeled and the beds are quite comfy. After staying at a remodeled ESA no way can you return to ESA original. Great AC is summer too. You dont get alot of TV channels but two Showtimes and four different ESPN channels should do the trick but no Fox Sports Arizona which stinks.',4
'When in doubt take a recommendation from some of the regulars.  The chicken salad sandwich is to die for. Well maybe not actually really die for... but Id drive there and pay full price for it.  Other reviewers are right -- this place is a bit pricey if you are on a budget -- but the way to get around that is to go for the daily special. For right around $6 you are out the door with your huge sandwich; a choice of chips potato salad or coleslaw; and a drink. $1.50 buys you a giant chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  The other secret is that they sell their bread (if they have any left) after 2 pm. Im still waiting to get a loaf of their sourdough to make into french toast on the weekend.',4
'I had never had dosai until this place opened.  Every version Ive tried is yummy!  The accompanying sauces however can be a little too heavy and spicy for me.',3
'Fantastic  plants  friendly and informative staff .  We stopped here in February and they identified the cacti in the yard of a new home my son and daughter had just purchased. We went today to buy plants and they were fun friendly and happy to help with plant advice .  Spend your money here rather than the big box stores.   You will not regret it   Pat C',5
'I have a tough time deciding how many stars to give this hotel.  I changed my mind 3 times a day during my four day stay at Firesky.  When I arrived my first thought was that I had finally found the Scottsdale hotel I would be loyal too (I keep switching in the years I come here).  Im partial to Kimpton hotels usually.  I was pleasantly greeted the entry was great the grounds were lovely and lots of welcoming pools.  We had a nice dinner at a well-above-average hotel restaurant and sat with drinks around a firepit in the gardens.    At 8pm if I had written this review 5 stars.  But we get into bed and well it was just not Kimpton quality.  The sheets are scratchy the bed feels a little old the pillows are hard.  I noticed that the towels are worn.  This might seem nit-picky but my experience is all hotels have raised their game in this area--even run of the mill Hiltons or Westins will have high thread count crisp sheets on high quality new beds and nice towels.  This was not as good and well below what I would have expected from Kimpton.  Thin walls too as we get to hear the ladies next door gab away (glad that is all we heard because it was pretty easy to hear!).  OK down to 4 stars.    Next day dawned and the nice service and the grounds were lovely again and the people serving free coffee were nice.  I was being whiney about the sheets right?  5 stars!  Room not cleaned by 3pm.  3 stars you losers.  Very apologetic about the room.  4 stars.  Great margarita.  A little buzzed.  Back to 5 stars dammit!  But then at the end...well we wanted to check out one hour after regular checkout because we had a spa treatment scheduled.  We wanted to give them more money!  So they went back and forth...no we cant extend...then the spa asks and they can extend...no we need you out so we can clean the room for the next guest (remember yesterday they could not clean the room until after 3!) yes we can no we cant...  Wow why was this such a big deal?  Who wanted my room John McCain?  Anyway...I end up at 3 stars as I walked out with a bad taste in my mouth but Ill see how my memory treats my stay at Firesky.',3
'Ok Im gonna be honest with my yelpers I was a little disappointed that a few were highlighting the New Mexican Burrito. Except for one that called it a formed egg burrito which made me laugh but was the most accurate. I finally took the time to drive out to 32 Shea after being excited about it for so long. I honestly went for the coffee but recent reviews were highlighting the food. I ordered the Nutella mocha & New Mexican burrito. I give it 2 stars for the mocha because it was just ok. Nothing special from my standpoint as Im always looking for that distinct flavor of espresso but it was not to be so. However the New Mexican burrito was just SAD!!! A formed egg bacon that looks like its from Wendys bacon and potatoes on a store bought package of tortillas. Seriously yelpers the McDonalds burritos have more flavor than that! Ok Ill get off the New Mexican burrito because the salsa was actually pretty good. The mocha wasnt bad just didnt really standout. I probably wont be back. Cartel Echo Nami are better spots.',2
'Cool set up! We liked the feel of the place. The food was good but I guess we were hoping for really good. We would return but only if we were in the area.',3
'03/07/13  While I immediately signed up for the free loyalty account online in July 2010 this was my first time watching a movie here.  I could kick myself for waiting all this time to find out what all the fuss was about!  I entered the theater lobby through the Tanzy entrance so I passed the concession stand to my right and the wrap-around couch with the wine kiosk to my left to get to the box office to redeem one of my  premium plus seating passes I received at the Yelp Elite event held at Tanzy back in December.  (Yes they were inside those delightful gift bags that very fortunate Yelp Elite members get to take home after having such a wonderful time at these events!)  I was going for the 7p Thursday showing of Jack the Giant Slayer** so besides the couple that arrived before me and who were being taken care of by a clerk I was the only one waiting in line and I didnt have to wait very long.  While it was nice not to have to wait for more than a minute or two I can see how these lines could get very long and tiresome during peak times so I suggest you book your tickets online or via mobile-- not only to avoid waiting in long lines (since theres only room for two clerks to wait on people) but to make sure you can select the seats you want!  Ive been to Ultra Star and Studio Movie Grill before so I was familiar with the seat selection process but if youve never been to either of these theaters then visiting for the first time with only a few minutes to get through the ticketing process before the movie starts might make the whole experience a little stressful.  Be wise and take some time now to check out www.ipic.com and familiarize yourself with the theater to maximize your theater enjoyment!  :)    After greeting me a warm welcome and asking me if Ive ever been there before I answered with a no she then asked me for my surname.  (Btw everyone here is so friendly before during and after the movie!)  After giving her my name I was reminded that I did sign up for the loyalty program a few years ago which then gave me a little jump seeing how long this theater has been open!  Soon after this process and with ticket in hand I found my way to auditorium #3 and quickly located my luxury seat.  Oh my goodness!  I knew already that this was quickly going to be one of my favorite theater venues and after settling down onto my seat and handed my free popcorn and 3D glasses and my request for a glass of water I knew that I was in for a terrific treat!  And then the 3D trailers started to play... OH BOY!  :)  $17 for premium plus seating with no price difference between regular and 3D films is a gorgeous steal when you consider everything youre getting in return: free popcorn (for you popcorn lovers) a pillow a lux blanket AND a seat with a button that upon depressing raises your legs so that youre able to recline as if laying down in a first-class airplane cabin.  The 3D glasses I received provided me the BEST 3D movie experience outside of 3D IMAX ($18.75 for Avatar at Harkins Arizona Mills) and a 4D Immersion experience (an additional $5 for a 15- or 20-minute film per person with an admission ticket to Baltimores National Aquarium).  Most theaters charge at least $13 for a 3D experience that at least for me can be a hit-or-miss and then for those who absolutely need it at the movies a small bag of popcorn which can cost you at least $3 elsewhere so add another $1 you get a personal bed complete with a pillow and blanket and the chance to enjoy a 3D film with what must be state-of-the-art 3D glasses!  (I so wished I saw Life of Pi 3D here...)  From the moment the trailers began I had a feeling I found THE place Im going to watch 3D at the movies from now on-- at iPic!  And after taking a quick look at the cocktails menu I know what Im going to try on my next visit which I will dutifully post a photo of and it will be very soon so stay tuned!  :)  p.s.  Free valet with your paid or gifted premium plus ticket!    ** Great movie considering everything youve read of the childrens classic fable and for all of the special effects the only way to see them at least for me is multi-dimensional!  Im looking forward to seeing more 3D films here.',4
'We came here on the last Saturday in June and the thermometer outside read 106 degrees.   It was a little after five pm and yet there were a dozen or so patrons already in the restaurant. This is always a good sign when you think about summers here in the Valley.   We were greeted promptly and our water glasses were filled by the time we were seated. The atmosphere is what Yelper Jacqueline H. described as a modern Italian Bistro and we would tend to agree.   The wait staff is very professional. Our waiter came over and introduced himself and shared with us the specials while offering a tasty description of each item.   We started with some wine and bruschetta. The bruschetta ($7.99) was very interesting. Instead of the usual tomato and garlic on toasted bread the chef had added small pieces of prosciutto and Spanish onions along with what we thought was a light vinaigrette to it. It was just enough for taste and didnt overwhelm the tomatoes and bread. Nice!   For our entree one of us ordered the Chicken Parmigiana special for $15.99 and the other the Seafood Fra Diavolo for $17.99 with linguine. Both were very tasty and interestingly prepared. The chicken had two whole breasts only lightly pounded and was prepared with home made breadcrumbs. The marinara sauce was yummy and wasnt very high in acidity as sometimes is the case.   The Fra Diavolo had both scrimp baby octopus and calamari. It too was yummy and the spice of the dish didnt overwhelm the taste buds. The only weakness was that the calamari was sliced somewhat thicker and was slightly ever so slightly chewy. But it was very good and we would definitely order it again.   We shared a Canoli for dessert along with coffee and a cappuccino which was a nice way to end the evening. The bill with taxes but without tip came to $71.47. We thought the food was excellent and portion sizes offered great value!   Go! Enjoy!',4
'My wife and I were looking for a good Indian restaurant in Scottsdale and came across Tandoori Times thanks to Yelp.  The reviews were positive service was question mark.  We were prepared for the wait.  We went on Sat. Night at 6:30 and sat right down.  We were well fed and walking out in just about an hour.  The service was friendly and great.  The Garlic and Onion Naan were great as recommended so was the Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Saag.  We are locals and like some spice in our food.  We are used to ordering spicy Mexican and it being just right.  We did the same here Wow they meant it.  Loved it but had a nice sweat going.  We were told after that mild is a 5 on spice meter what we had was 8 out of 10.  You might try mild first trip.   I did not give 5 stars due to that being a rare mark for off the chart experience like the old Sea Saw or Binkleys.  We left with a great dinner experience and a take out menu.  We will go back maybe mild next time.',4
'Tuck Shop is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Phx. Everything is superb from the service to drinks to food to overall experience. Definitely go soon!',5
'I ate here for lunch because they are on my eScrip rewards list.  I wasnt expecting a dark bar... I ordered some chili and it was OK.  It didnt compare to the chili I ate a week earlier at Gallaghers.  The waitress helped me lightly - I asked for some crackers that were not provided automatically.    I may come back here - if Im in a dark bar mood at lunch.  If so Ill order something other than the chili.',2
'To my surprise the turkey club sandwich I bought at Kokopeli Deli located at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Aiport (Terminal 3) was quite tasty!  Aside from a good amount of turkey it came with tomato lettuce crispy bacon and mayonnaise on wheat bread.  The turkey tasted well with the warm crispy bacon and juicy tomato slices.  The downside as all food sold at airports the price for the turkey club sandwich was a bit high at $7.50 with a soft drink bottle at $2.70!',3
'had family friends come in town and they wanted good mexican food and good fajitas. serranos had both- the bean dip and salsa they bring to the table were excellent. the service was great and our entrees were wonderful. will be returning again soon!',4
'MMMMMMMMMMMM Good! The fried chicken here is fantastic.The chicken was thoroughly cooked (doesnt happen every place).  My chicken bread was moist and juicy and some of  the best fried chicken Ive ever had. The breading was not too greasy and tasted very good. After i finished my piece I wanted more!  The waffle served with the chicken is very good! A very nice size and complemented the chicken well. I could do without the the slab of butter a 1/4 of the butter would do.  The mac and cheese as a side is a definite winner!   Im a big fan of the drinks coming in a mason jar.  Service was good.  I think the cost of the food is slightly overpriced. The 1 chicken breast and waffle was $8. A side of mac and cheese was $3.50.  One side item should come with every meal.   Based on how much I enjoyed the chicken and mac and cheese Ill be back.',4
'I loooooove this restaurant!! The food is fantastic and the prices arent bad as well! The location is a little scary (downtown Phoenix) but dont let that deter you from an awesome Mexican food experience!!!',5
'So got a tip from a friend that I really needed to check this place out so we headed over for dinner with friends after Ignite Phoenix. I kind of wanted to go some place else and wound up being S glad my friend picked this place :)  When we pulled up I thought oh Im so not in the mood for nice (ie expensive hotel restaurant (its inside the Clarendon) I was tired and not dressed for it. I was pleasantly surprised that the place looked very nice but has a really comfortable super low key vibe. The service was really good our waiter was very friendly and he didnt make fun of me when I tried order the side of corn (Elote Callejero. yeah you say it). Anyway the food was awesome- they do breakfast all day so I got huevos rancheros which were really good. The side of refried beans was ok about what youd expect but. the. corn. Oh my. It was heavenly- its an ear of grilled corn sprinkled with paprika and piled high with coija cheese. It was sooo good.   We finished the meal with the Crepas or banana crepes which were really nice the crepes were very good! Everything right down to the chips and salsa were very good and we will definitely be back. By the way the price was very reasonable before the tip we paid about $35 for our half of the appetizer 2 meals a soda 2 beers 2 side dished and dessert. do it.',5
'Asian airport food - what more could you expect. I wish I ate at Paradise Bakery & Cafe next door.',2
'We were not happy with this place at all. We went a little later in the evening and the lady working seemed very annoyed that we came in. I love leaving work on time like anyone else but if business comes in I suck it up and smile! She was cleaning all around us and it was ver uncomfortable. Once we got our food it was so bland. I got the chile relleno and rice. The rice was a plain scoop of white rice with no flavor and the chile relleno was just plain and mushy. My husband got the chicken burrito and it was literally just baked chicken and rice with no flavor at all. The empanadas were okay but I felt weird that they just came microwaved in a plastic bag. Havent gone again',1
'Awesome place. Had the purist sandwich. Ingredients were super fresh. Flavors were all in balance. No overloading of basil or peppers. And LOVED seeing that they had local wines for sale - caduceus and merkin.',5
'Thank heavens Westminster (Viet town) finally came to Phoenix. This restaurant brings out the goodness of food from OC the rightful descendent of Trie Chu restaurant; in terms of their de facto yellow egg noodle soup that is Khmer and Chinese style and maybe even better..  This restaurant is a delight brand new clean and the most desirable within Mekong Plaza shopping center. There is no reason to become Forgettable not execute the dishes properly  and not offer plenty of food and fresh garnishment when youre next door to a SE Asian supermarket.  Com Tam Thuan Kieu did well for us. I came in with relatives from out of town and we decided to try this new restaurant.  They are located across from unPhogettable pho restaurant(guess which one l like more). When you walk in you can see that is new. They have nice decor seating and proper table size. You can tell right away from the generous varieties of standard table spices( hoisen sauce sliced green pepper black better fried red chili red chili bottle fish sauce soy salt..)  that it will likely be a treat.   Their menu consist of 232 selections; mainly 14 appetizers 63 Com Tam 17 egg noodles 7 udon noodles 85 vermicelli dishes etc. Coincidentally all 3 of us diners arrived at the same #91 egg noodle dish ; the Mi Nam Vang for $5.99 . We also got shrimp eggrolls for appetizer. So you know this place does not serve pho..  Our food arrived in about 5-7 minutes. These bowl were large.  I must say the broth for an egg noodle souple is perfection. The best way to describe the broth is that it had a crisp taste to it with a moderate hint of meatiness or flavor and absolutely little trace of floating oily fat and generous in quantity.. just done right. Within the bowl were 4 shrimps finely cut portions of quality pork and traces of other fine meat the right quantity and quality egg noddles that still is crisp and one surprising quail egg(for mixing). See the pics...The garnishments were the best I seen in Phoenix so far and generously portioned also ; sprouts limes green pepper that leaf that looks like  a weed and  the shingiku (tongo) leaf... This soup bowl could be the only meal of the day and I would say healthy and refreshing one. Service was responsive and minimally sufficient.   Our group was extremely happy and would be happy to come again.  A great way to start the shopping. It came to about $10 a person a surperb value and this place is definitely on my recommended list......  BTW: Its cool that they decided to build this shopping center in the middle of a desolate strip of Mesa.  Anyone who likes SE Asian food done right is lucky to be near this place.',4
'You have no idea how happy I was when this place opened - and turned out to be good! I was really tired of driving into Scottsdale to get my hair cut. I lucked out when I booked an appointment and by luck of the draw wound up being styled by Maira. Shes great at what she does sweet as can be and always remembers little details of my life that even I forgot I told her!  I really like that they dont even try to push product on you unlike many other salons and they give you a mini-massage before your shampoo.  I took a star away because of a bad experience I had with one of their aestheticians about 2 years ago. She put Retinol on my eyelids which is a no-no. Lots of itching and pain for a few days afterwards. She also made like she was giving me a product for free but wound up charging me for it. Like I said that was 2 years ago and I dont think that aesthetician is still working there but I havent gone in for anything other than a haircut since. If you want a facial Blu-Sol is just a couple of doors down.  A shampoo cut and style runs me $32 plus tip. Much better than driving to Scottsdale and paying twice as much for the same service!',4
'Add this spot to your list of places to consume multiple cold ones. Other than that this spot is only just OK. Loco Patron is an oldie but goodie in the fact that its been around for awhile and continues to be decent. Its straight across the board decent which isnt necessarily bad. Do they have decent food? Yes. Do they have decent drinks? Yes. Do they have a decent crowd? On occasion.   If you are looking for a Taco Tuesday spot a spot to day drink and a spot to enjoy a night out with friends this is an option to consider.',3
'Went here Friday night with my wife Carol and our friend Kathy for Karaoke in the bar/saloon. We arrived early for dinner (around 6pm) Karaoke started at 7pm. I have to admit its been years sine Ive been here and when I used to go it was in the restaurant not the bar/saloon..  We were immediately seated and ask what we wanted to drink  and then the waitress (her name was Cookie) took our order Carol & Kathy ordered the all-y-u-can-eat fish I asked if I could try a small piece before I ordered.  Cookie said that would be no problem.  Cookie brought out drinks and me two small pieces of fish. I tasted it and decided I would order it as well..   When the fish came the pieces we very large and piping hot. The batter wasnt to heavy and the fish was mouthwateringly moist flaky tender and tasty. We all agreed we like the fish was cooked perfectly which is a rarity.  I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Freshness characterizes everything we had. Highly recommended   I was pleasantly surprised . The service was excellent and the food was served promptly and efficient. Freshness characterizes everything   FOOD: Huge portions Top quality SERVICE: Genuine good service which was a joy to witness. Our waitress was professional and attentive. PRICE: Comparable to other steak restaurants.  AMBIANCE: Rustic western steakhouse atmosphere. Yet popular with the locals and a place to bring out of town guests.  CONCLUSION: RETURN FACTOR 100%.   ************************* What does my OVERALL rating mean?*************************  5 stars -Highly recommended.  I would be willing to drive out of my way to this business. It is that good. This place represents their industry or cuisine very well!  4 stars - Highly Recommended. I would frequent this business.  3 stars - Not that good but not that bad. Just average. I wouldnt mind going again.  2 stars - I would not recommend this establishment to friends or family.  1 stars - DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND DO NOT patronize this business. I would RUN AWAY from this place and you should too! DONT WAST YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AT THIS ESTABLISH',4
'Not bad at all but when you ask for a pastis at a supposedly French place and the waiter does not know what youre talking about thats a very bad sign. Then I asked what rye whiskies they had. None. Hmm not much of a bar to speak of. Their bourbon selection was good but for a fancy place like this could have been much better. Yes Im a spirits snob but at a supposedly upscale bar they should have these sort of things. Everything was pretty good especially the appetizers--the special seared Ahi Tuna that day seemed a little over-priced at $24. My friend had the coq au vin and it got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Oh and the server was good but he had other people bring out the and this one lady just shouted out what it was and you had to raise your hand. Kind of tacky for a nice restaurant. With good food though definite room for improvement and I hope they work on their service and bar selection.',3
'I loved this place!  Cute Christmas lights indoor and outdoor seating (with heat lamps) and delicious (and strong) limoncello. Fabulous date night. My boyfriends calzone was clearly burnt to a crisp on the top which he took off. When the waitress came by to ask about the meal he told her and she just said sorry. A little disappointing but the freshness of the ingredients sang to me and my little pizza was perfect with asian pear arugula and gorgonzola. I liked it so much I had the left overs for breakfast the next day. I would love to go back. The crust also had the perfect bite and flavor. Yum!',4
'Now THIS is real Mexican food!   The food is simple DELICIOUS & very reasonably priced.   You have to place your order at the counter & then they normally bring it to your table for you. I always get an Horchata to sip on while I wait :)   One of my favorite entrees there is the Carne Asada Torta yum! But I have yet to try anything there that I wasnt happy with. And dont skip desert forget the never ending diet & indulge in some fresh home made flan :) You wont be sorry!   The staff are friendly & make you feel at home :)  The location is small (tables inside & a few outside) bright lively & inviting. They are located near a gallery that you can saunter through until youre able to button your pants back again lol   It gets full at midday so its best if you go before or after the lunch rush. Parking is a bit difficult to find but its worth it.',4
'Food is pretty good. Large portions take home half. Noisy...',3
'Incredible!',5
'The most convenient Farmers Market in Phoenix for our family. This is a great farmers market but if you do not arrive early forget getting the harder to find items like the first produce of the season leeks fresh eggs or bulk worms for your garden or composter. A few of these vendors also sell at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market on Sundays. There is no live music but the people are friendly and the produce is far better tasting than what you get at Trader Joes or Whole Foods.',5
'Love the Bellinis!! And the food is always consistently good. Yes you do have to wait if you go for dinner but hey if you have to wait its a great place to watch people....and you can always have a Bellini while you wait :-). Parking is slim but Sears is just across the way and that parking lot is always empty so park there.  I am sorry that they dont offer whole wheat pizza crust anymore - Pleeeaaassse bring this back. We sat at the bar this visit and the gal tending the area was very friendly and attentive. Even our neighbors on the stools next to us were friendly - Oreganos is just a fun place - you cant help smile at all the t-shirt slogans! Were thrilled they opened up. PV mall used to be so nice and it has really gone down.',4
'I work on my feet all day sometimes up to 12 hours and I am required to wear heels or wedges. I have purchased Cathy Jean shoes on and off for about three years and overall they have held up very well. I am a big fan of their classic black wedge style with a knot on the top they have had variations of this style for years and it is very comfortable for being a 4 to 5 inch heel. I recently purchased a new pair and they definitely have a breaking in period but once they are broken in they will be fantastic very cushioned on the arch and heel.  I have also purchased boots here which I have had one pair for two years and also taken on a trip to London and they are still looking pretty good. I will have to retire them soon (always a sad day) but I will probably go back to Cathy Jean to replace them. Prices are good and there is usually always a sale going on. Prices range from $30 to $120 and some shoes are made with all synthetic and some are made with a leather synthetic blend.  Customer service at this location on my most recent visit was very good. The cash register drawer got stuck when I needed my change but it was no big deal and the associate kept her cool. She was very helpful and had a positive attitude. Better service than I had received here in the past. They used to only have manual receipts so the fact that they have a cash register at all is an upgrade and helpful to the associates and the customer. This is a final sale store but just know that going into it. Be sure of your purchase and you will be okay. Overall good. I will be back.',4
'Several very good things about the Hyatt Place. Although its in an ugly corporate park about 100 meters to the east is an excellent paved trail that follows a dried riverbed. The complementary breakfasts were good. Outdoor pool. Comfortable rooms.  We only had one problem here. We booked using a third-party website that specified two double beds and when we got here all they had was a room with a king. I get it that those things arent guaranteed. But to the general manager we attempted to negotiate with I ask cant you at least pretend to be sympathetic? Even an insincere Im sorry would have gone a long way. Did you miss that first day of class when you took Service Industry 101? Smug and condescending might be more fun for you but nobody likes a little tyrant.',1
'We were greeted at the door with some friendly heckling by the manager as we entered and the good natured ribbing continued throughout the meal.  The food was simple and delicious warm bread with garlic butter meat ravioli with red sauce and some lovely veal parm.  I was a fan of the portion sizes since Ill eat what is in front of me despite fullness at times.  The smell of the kitchen was a wonderful compliment to the meal and the wait staff was gracious and cheerful.   For the sizes of the meals it felt a little expensive but everything tasted freshly made with vibrant flavors so I forgave the price a little.',4
'This place is amazing!!  Great concept very healthy food vibe is very cool and service was outstanding.  There are few places where I want to try everything on the menu and this place is one of them.   I cant wait to go back.   PS Open a location in Miami',5
'My wife did not enjoy the manicure or the spa pedicure. They bring over a porcelain/ceramic bowl to soak your feet in. This doesnt seem very sanitary. However the workers had plenty to say about the Asian shops being unclean. My wife has never gotten a fungal or other type of infection from her regular place an Asian shop. The manicure was awful too. The polish looked terrible and lasted barely a week. She definitely wont be returning.',1
'They have a little of everything.  When the items on sale on clearance it is a plus!  The employees are super helpful.',4
'I was at this location this afternoon. The young girl who waited on me was delightfully pleasant. The gelato is always wonderful! The chocolate is has a very strong rich flavor. The place is always clean and neat.',4
'As a current chandler resident for the past 3.5 years I have grown quite fond of Los favoritos for some time for a few reasons.  One being the red salsa which is not watery like Disgusting Filly Bs. Any secondly their carne asada is a whole hell of a lot better most of the time than Filly Bs as well. But for Some Bizarre reason this Los Favs doesnt quite make par for me as far as taste tests go compared to the Chandler Location. There is this strong salty taste every time I have had their carne asada fries and I highly doubt they salt their french fries then load on more salty stuff. Then they just kind of dab the sour cream on one side and guacamole on another.  Now I know this sounds like I am just being over critical and picky as can be I am just extremely used to the pizzaz and way of doing things at the other location.  I will be trying their burritos next time so I can see how those turn out a little nervous but I will give them one more shot.',3
'Best Neighborhood  spot  hands down. great food  great prices great staff.great management. It always works. The salsa is great the fish top notch the drinks  just excellent . We  have been regulars for over 10 years and never get tired of the great food . Music in the bar  best shrimp cocktail you will every enjoy. You can count on them . Michael has hired local kids  I have known since they were 5 years old and taught them many lessons in life number one lesson treat people with care work hard and take pride in what you do..It shows!',5
'Whats not to like about this place? Great beers an amazing turkey burger (I dont eat much beef) and delicious fries. I always got a kick from how they serve their fries in mini shopping carts. Definitely get the half regular half sweet potato. Ive also had their paninis which are about standard with roasted vegetables and some pressed crusty bread.  This is a great place to bring a date or to go out with a couple friends. The service has always been excellent and the food is consistent. The prices arent too bad for a gourmet burger place. Overall its a great place to start a night out in the town.',4
'If Heaven served Mexican Food it would come from Valle Luna.',5
'Well the old owners may have been from San Ho but they sold it to another family from Minn. or something like that. I personally think the pho broth is a little cinnamon strong but if you add some nuoc beau to the broth it will make it taste a whole lot better. Normally I order the pho dac biet which ive been eating since the mid 80s but I recently started to order the Bun Bo Hue which I think is a lot better (broth wise) because of the lemon grass that the stock is made with. If you need a pho fix the place is decent. As far as the prices.... I remember when I could get a bowl of pho for $3.50 back in the days.',4
'The food was good. The service sucked! Our server Ceasar was super nice when he first came to the table. However after our entrees were delivered that was the last time we saw him. I have never ever....ever been somewhere that lets a beer glass go completely empty. Let alone a glass of tea which both happened. The busser actually filled my husbands tea and another server came and offered us boxes. Then I was finally offered a 2nd beer after I was about 97% done with my meal. It is a shame because the menu was inventive. We would have tried other items like we were going to order dessert but due to the neglect we will not be returning.',2
'Definitely one of the better Starbucks in the area that I have been to.  I enjoy coming to this location a little bit more then the others for a variety of reasons. For starters plenty of tables! Ive been able to find a seat here every single time Ive come over the last few weeks and this makes me very happy.  Also for the most part its really clean.  The one time I needed a table wiped down (it was busy and the customer was walking out as I was walking in) it was done quickly by the barista.  Staff here is friendly and outgoing and seem to do a good job of keeping it that way.  Place is well stocked bathrooms are clean enough and overall I really enjoy coming here.  Even though it gets busy at times its a far better experience then Ive had at other Starbucks close to me.  Parkings a little tight so be careful getting in and out and its in a strip mall so theres lots of cars coming in and out.  Even though its an extra mile from my house its worth coming here.  Free wifi as with all the other starbucks and they have great hours too!',4
'Came here to study for a few hours. I got a delicious iced latte. VERY GOOD coffee!! Wi-fi is fast. Great customer service. Also the food looks good!',5
'So I stopped in with a friend today after lunch because he had wanted to grab some spices for some dishes he was going to cook and I got to tag along.  I admit I need to step up my cooking game a bit and I think this place gave me some motivation to do so.  I had never heard of this place before and when my friend had mentioned it I admit I was intrigued. A store just for spices? My brain lit up at this idea. Honestly  I didnt know what to expect when I entered but I can tell you this is one heck of an interesting place.  Upon entering the place smelled like a spice store but in a good way.  Clean well organized with a huge selection of just about every spice possible.    Each bottle comes not only with the ingredients but ideas on how to use it as well.  Some of the spices seemed unique to me and I found it interesting to see what things can be used to spice up dishes.  The spices themselves come in a variety of sizes and ranging in prices.  I saw some that were just a few dollars for a small container and over $40 for others.  The jars they sell them in are reuseable so if you buy a jar of a certain spice you can purchase the bag to reuse the same bottle. I like this idea. Plus they also sell empty bottles in the corner of the store if you want to bottle your own spices if you should have a garden at home or make a special concoction.  Overall I was really impressed with this place.  Well organized staff was friendly prices were fair and there was an ample selection of items to choose from of all kinds. If your in the area I would suggest checking this place out. Really cool and you dont have to be a master chef to shop here.',4
'I was there the other night 20 minutes til close...they were out of mayo ketchup lettuce tomato iced tea and baked potatoes...whats left to order?  Just close early...',2
'First time to Phoenix and had a GREAT experience and burger.  I built my own and it was one of the best burgers Ive had in a long time!  Cant wait to come back to Phoenix!',5
'If youre looking for a place to kick up your feet get some good coffee and read a book - this is it. If youre looking for a place to grab a seat pull out your laptop and get some work done - this is it. If youre looking for a place that has some killer cupcakes - this is it (or so Ive been told).   The only reason Im giving this place four stars is because of personal preference. Im not a cream cheese frosting kind of a guy and their cupcakes are almost exclusively frosted with that stuff. They do have other options for something to go along with your coffee but Ive only tasted the cookies and theyre just about ok.  Ive also had lunch here on occasion and although nothing Ive had stands out nothing Ive had disappoints.  All-in-all if youre looking for a place to catch up with a friend catch up on some emails or catch up on some reading; look no further. Great ambiance friendly staff and cool vibe.',4
'A great selection of chocolates and sweets including a pleasantly surprising amount of sugar free products.',5
'Almost a month later and we still dont have our couch we were told was IN STOCK.  This is one of the only places my fiance and I have found some decent looking couches here around Tempe/Chandler.  We found the perfect one and were told it was in stock in the color fabric we wanted.  So we went ahead with the Lease to Own option signed the paperwork and paid the down payment on Nov 27th.  We leave the store to go pick the couch up and then they call us and tell us its not in stock until the week of Dec 12th.... We are obviously very upset since we asked SEVERAL times if the couch was in stock.  We needed something to sit on in our apartment and threatened to cancel the whole thing- so they say we can give u the couch in another color as a loaner until your couch comes in and we will swap them out free delivery.  So reluctantly we agreed and the sales associate tells us shell call us the week of the 12th to set up delivery- she didnt call we had to call them and they told us it was still on backorder- that the week of the 19th it will be in stock.  Well Its Dec 23rd and we had to call THEM again because no one called us.  The couch is now said to be coming in the week of Dec 26th.  So basically weve been sitting on a loaner couch for a month and they still dont have our couch.  Unless you want a couch you dont want- dont sign or pay for anything until youve checked 50 times with them that its in stock even then youll probably get screwed.  Dont buy here!  Craptastic customer service steer clear of Liberdy the sales associate.',1
'Ive lived down the street from this carwash for years. Since I wanted to removed a think layer of dirt and dust from a car quickly I went here for the quick automated wash. The price was good and all but the problem happened when I got back home and noticed that the roughness of the automated wash had torn off one of my side mirror panels. I went back there to ask them if they had found it and they let me look around a bit. It had only been no more than 15 minutes since I had left there and it was no where to be found. One of the employees there tried to tell me that it could have slipped under the drain which is impossible because this panel is over 6x 8 and would not have slipped through the grate. All I got in response to this was a simple sorry and no offer of anything to make it up. I had to buy a $100 replace for both mirrors as they are not sold individually. Personally since I looked everywhere for it myself Im thinking the piece may have been run over by another customers car after mine and they just threw away the evidence.',2
'I want to give this place a better rating but I just cant.....yet.  I had been meaning to try this place out for awhile as Ive been wanting to find a great butcher.  I think the problem I had here was that I didnt come for anything in particular and I felt really overwhelmed.  The service here was amazing though as soon as I walked in a man came out and spent time explaining the different cuts of steak and bacon and was incredibly helpful.  I do think the prices are a little steep but definitely not outrageous and Im willing to pay those for quality meat.  I took a to-go menu with me so that next time Ill be better prepared; apparently they have WAY more to offer then whats shown in the case and freezer.  The man also informed me that you can call orders in ahead of time so that it will be ready when you walk it; thats rad!  I like this place and I think it has the potential to wow but Im just not there yet.',3
'I have played the Palm course 15-20 times over the past five years its a challenging and fun course. The 18th hole gives me all kinds of trouble! They have a nice clubhouse with good food particularly breakfast and the bloody marys are good and spicy!',4
'Great place. Service was prompt and courteous. The food could be considered a little on the spicy side (for the novices) but for those with a trained palate it was delicious. All you need to bring is your appetite. Cant wait to go back.',5
'Great food fries rings burgers are fantastic and kills Culvers',4
'Had such an amazing experience here last week.   Dined here after early day from work with my best friend and my grand parents. We had appetizers lunch (nana and I had pastas zach and my papa had sandwiches we had deserts (lava cake cheesecakes and tiramisu wine and coffee) and the entire meal was exceptional.  Lunch was super busy but they always kept an eye on us and made sure we were well taken care of.   I have always had an amazing experience at Brio and love it there. Check it out for date night or for a nice family dinner.',5
'Are you tired of hearing all the hype or getting stuck in line at Pizzeria Bianco?  If so seek out this hidden gem in Tempe.  The pizza is incredible and are easily some of the best pies in the Valley...oh...and you wont be starving from a 3 hour wait.  Bianco is one of those places you take out-of-towners to ooohh and ahhh at maybe once every year or two...Classic Italian Pizza is the place you keep going back to over and over!',5
'Do NOT go to this restaurant if you cant use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance.',1

'REVERSE HAPPY HOUR STARTS 9PM PEOPLE!!!! Very very good happy hr prices.  awesome place to go this time of night when you are looking to chill and have a few drinks...from mixed drinks beer sake..whatever your poison is Im sure they have it.  I just really like the atmosphere at night...the music the indoor/outdoor bar/patio vibe they got going on here t.vs..and the huge fish tank that serves as wall separating the dining area from the drunks-it all just works-plain and simple.  oh yea and the menu is pretty decent too- sorry i get a little over excited about good drink prices..  check it out peeps!',4
'Favorite pho in town. Great service.  Fun happy hour with super affordable prices to try lots of small plates.  Def in our regular rotation now.',5
'A rare find in Anthem is dinning that is not Pizza Wings or Subs.  Chef Brian Ford brings the cure for what ails Anthem dinning.  Although it sets on the corner of a Signature Frys strip center it is a find.  The food is good the atmosphere matches the cuisine and best of all they take reservations.  May I recommend that you do make one.  As the word on Madelyns gets out I suspect they will only get busier.    What makes Madelyns unique?  Try rolling a wine bar bar and upscale dinning into one small corner restaurant.   They also feature a live jazz band on select weekends.  I am anxious to give that a try as well.  On our evenings menu we shared the Cajun Fondue pot...yum I had the wedge salad while Ipod Kenny had the Madelyn burger...yes I know a burger....but it was great!!   After the fondue eating a larger meal just was not possible but the options looked great.  The Salmon and the Peppered Beef tenderloins served at a nearby table looked fabulous.  YES we did peer onto other tables with envy!!!  Another unique aspect of Ms is the $20 bottle of wine.  Really a nice option!  I am ready to return and explore my way through more of this well planned menu.',5
'Awesome placefastcheapclean and delicious.',5
'A good place for kids. There is a play area. The pizza was not very bland/generic. If you want good pizza this is not the place.',2
'I had a serious craving for Roti.  So glad I found this place.  A very small menu selection but it had exactly what I wanted.  The serving for $8.20 after tax is enough for 2 meals.  I know where to go from now on for a great meal with leftovers.  This is a noteworthy place to bring my Uncle T.J. whos a Trini when he comes to visit.',4
'We followed Dr. David Ciminello from Pueblo Pediatrics in Mesa to Desert Shores Pediatrics.  Dr. Ciminello is an outstanding pediatrician in all ways.  He has a wonderful bedside manner that allows him to connect with kids and his diagnosiss have been accurate.  He takes his time with patients and parents.  He thoroughly explains things and is prompt with follow-ups.  I have nothing but great things to say about him!',5
'Absolutely as good as it gets.  We went here for a birthday and got the tasting menu.  There were 8 courses of incredibly detailed sushi plates including huge amounts of real wasabi and truffles.    This was the best meal of my life.',5
'Oh Upper Deck! Let me count the ways in which you are lame:  - You have a $25 minimum for credit cards. Ayesha assures me that this is a standard thing yet Ive lived in the quintessential college town for 15 years and Ive never even heard of anything so egregious. I mean we drank well over $25 but still... lame.  - A server never even looked at us. Not once.  - Your clever little Balls to the Wall mural has a hockey puck in it.  Puck not ball.  - Your food appears to be from large industrial size bags that sit frozen until the need to deep fry/microwave them arises.  Keep in mind I have almost zero standards for food.  - And honestly I drug my girlfriend here because it is supposedly a Michigan bar and we were going to watch Michigan basketball.  I was willing to overlook just about anything - I just wanted to watch them play with like minded fans.  But seriously its 2009 and you DONT HAVE HD?!? You are a sports bar.  HD was practically created for you.    OK Michigan won and they played the fight song over the speakers in the bar that was cool and I was happy for it being so far from home thats worth one star. But under normal circumstances why anyone would ever come here to watch sports is completely beyond me.',1
'Great layout.  It almost seemed like their bar had different venues.  Great food & selection of beers too.  I was amazed how awesome the service was.  We went on a really busy night.',4
'Thai Basil was a good addition to Park Central. this neglected mall is a ghost town at night. Im sure Thai Basil can do  good business off the assorted Club Central crowd as either a before or post happy hour eatery. Open till 9pm on Saturday is good for me too.   the Menu is typical Thai fare. the spring rolls i really enjoyed. they have yellow corn stuffed in side. i was quite surprised by it. Im used to cabbage clear rice noodles and various carrots but CORN!! it was freaking delish. the dipping sauce was accompanied by a small salad.  i ordered Red Currey (Medium Spice) it was very flavorful..but..medium?. i didnt notice any heat. not like in a mild. but like a missing heat. next time Im going hot. and i pray they deliver the goods. i want scorching. tongue tingling action here.  my homegirl got Garlic Vegetable with chicken (Mild) we both figured go weak on this one cause shes not a hot person. and if it was weak. toss on some chili sauce. so..yea chili sauce was added.  the flavors were on point. garlicky and full of taste. not often do you see green beans in Asian food. i think the playful touches add allot.   like David S.B. noticed in his review. Thai Elephant was much hotter. if these two restaurants are indeed related. i wonder why the flavor variations??  the decor is also quite different. there was only one image on the wall. and it looked like a WW2 Era picture of a family member who was serving in the Thai Liberation army or something. (i just made that up) which is a juxtaposition of most Thai restaurants i have been to which have random Buddhist idols and what-nots. honestly i like the change up.  total on the bill for two entrees and an order of spring rolls was 36.Change which is pretty good.  if Thai Basil and Thai Elephant are related. i think they have little twists that make each place different. i look forward to returning.   there was a party of about 8-9 when we arrived which at the time we got there. they were the only other people in the restaurant. so i think this place is good for groups...as of now. when this place picks up in popularity..i dont think it would be all that comfortable with a large group..inside. outside will be great. lots of ceiling fans to keep the area cool.',4
'Its decent.  We had thin crust.  Im not sure if there were any other types of crust.  Its cheap at $3 a slice.  Its pretty small inside and usually theres a line out the door.  However the line goes fast.',3
'I came here for happy hour on a Tuesday and had the pleasure of having Justin as our bartender. He was personable and speedy with making our drinks. Plus when we didnt even know what we wanted to drink he brought the perfect drinks over. The drinks and food were awesome! Service was amazing! We cant wait to go back there!',5
'I enjoy the juicy succulent taste of murder but Ive also got friends that would skin me if I took them to a steak house. To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat its always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesnt just have the hold the chicken type vegg friendly option on the menu its got lentils and shit.  Now since weve already established that I live under rocks you can just go ahead and assume Ive never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass Ill be noshing right next to you on a regular basis.   The restaurant has apparently expanded twice since its been open and it was still hoppin last night with an open airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs dont watch human TV they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. Ill be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)  Others have complained about the poor service at this location but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldnt quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options the black bean burger the lavosh shawarma wrap or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasnt an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines which I dont really like that much but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad because if youve ever met him he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again sarcasm).  We ordered an extra pita for the hummus which was overkill and we didnt even end up touching it because the small hummus ended up being freakin huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is) cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Mans grilled vegetable salad was also very well done with crisp veggies lots of garlic and an awesome dressing.   And this delish bounty of fresh healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Ill definitely be coming here again and frequently so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies sorority sisters cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place. Unheard of!',3
'The place is beautiful very green very jungle oasis in the middle of sun-scorched Phoenix-Scottsdale area. The food at the restaurants was very descent same about the drinks. With the spa and pools and restaurants and Scottsdale shopping by the time I had a closer look at the room and notice that it was small and had the much hated shower-bath combo It really did not matter. The bed was soft the linens fresh and in the morning the view from my balcony was lovely. I had my breakfast and went back to the spa and stayed there till the check out time.',4
'I live in the West Valley and whenever I meet my family in the East valley it HAS to be Flancers.  I love the fresh baked bread and the philly style sandwich (get the green chilil mayo...soooo good) is my favorite.  I hear everything else is good but I dont know since I always get the same dang thing!  Maybe if I lived closer I would try more...',5
'Im hooked on their steak quesadilla with green chili sauce like a ten dollar hooker to crack. Its that good. I have dreams about it.  Damn good strawberry margaritas as well.  And like Daren writes the pollo fundido is pretty amazing. Also recommend the pollo chimi with green chili sauce and sour cream. Or red chili sauce... Both are great.  Best Mexican Ive found anywhere in the valley so far.  Bring your appetite because the portions are huge.  My only gripes are that the service at the inside bar almost always sucks and the cheapskate moron of an owner needs to fix the ridiculous urinal thats about 10 off the floor in the mens bathroom.',4
'The idea and concept are great...but the atmosphere is not appealing and non inspiring to be honest. The food is average....but I guess this being a downtown establishment....shouldnt expect much. The fact that it is connected to the Lexington hotel....it is really just like any other average hotel restaurant. I heard it is closing or moving maybe....and quite honestly I am not surprised. I do wish them good luck because again the concept is great......but it needs great improvement to its overall atmosphere and appeal. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!',2
'A buddy had been recommending this place for a while and after getting a ridiculous diagnosis and quote from Airpark Jeep I called Dave to get his thoughts.  He is an extremely knowledgeable down to earth and a genuinely nice guy.  He went over all the things that the dealership told me I needed and broke them down into things I needed to do things I should think about doing and things that were completely unnecessary.  His prices were half of what the dealership would have charged and I have so much more confidence in the repairs as well.  In a world where it is hard to find someone that is not out to get you for as much as they can it is refreshing to deal with an honest company that is really looking out for your best interests.  I cant recommend Dave and Advanced Autoworks enough.',5
'Heres the thing.  Were pretty big fans of Cork so when we learned about BLD we were super excited to go.  Sadly our first experience was really bad.  Because we loved Cork so much we decided not to write a review until we had gone a 2nd time.  Could be a fluke right?  Wrong.    Heres the breakdown.  Visit 1:  1. We received chicken that was still releasing pink (not clear) liquids.  When we asked them to give us new chicken the server literally asked oh you want that more well done? as if there is another way to serve chicken. 2. After getting the chicken back we found that they didnt actually replate the dish they just put new chicken on it.  So if the pink liquid did contain any bacteria it was definitely still there. 3. Both my husband and I had some pretty terrible digestion issues that I wont go into detail on. 4. The servers seemed genetically engineered to avoid their tables.  In the 2 hours we were there Id say we saw our server three times.  Visit 2:  1. The service was a bit better today but... 2. Both my husband myself and a 3rd guest had Bridesmaids style reactions to the food within a few hours of our visit.  Im talking total upper and/or lower GI evacuation.   Both visits Id say cost roughly $30 per person and we ended up sick and annoyed.  I will never return.',1
'Overpriced but good food.  The wine list is pretty good.  I prefer the central location to the arcadia however Postinos has great share food items and is an overall decent place to meet with friends.',4
'As I read the Meh Ive experienced better I thought yes this is how I felt.  I went in 45 minutes before close and it took 30 min minimum to get out of there.  I really wish it was taken into account that I went in and spent money on a new iPhone and the amount of money that I spend monthly with them that the service and attitudes of the staff would be A+...maybe it is a bigger issue on a corporate level... darn AT&T...',2
'So in love with Lux! Trendy doesnt quit cover it. People watching is priceless. Chill environment. Great food coffee and wine. Mac and cheese with jalapenos and bacon is unreal! Sport (football basketball ect...) in the back room on a huge screen entertains my son and boyfriend so I can get some chill time in. Staff is so friendly and personable. Thoroughly impressed!',5
'Solid lunch spot when you want something more than the standard soup sandwich salad.  I ordered some chicken medallion / side of potatoes dish and it was really good.  The queso dip was also good too.',3
'Oct 16 2013  Green curry-lunch special with tofu Comes with a small side salad 1 slice of watermelon 1 spring roll and hot and sweet sauce for spring roll 4/5  Dont really love the salad dressing though.  Customer service-4/5  Would definitely go again for lunch special.',4
'Great food always. Service slow tonight but will always come back as we love this place!',4
'came here for a late dinner with my roommate. it was a perfect night to get seating in the patio area by the bar. i love the decor and the atmosphere. we started with a couple of drinks...i got the bourbon ginger lemonade and roomie got the mango mai tai. somehow the drink order got mixed up and i ended up getting a fuji apple sangria instead. however our waitress was super nice and threw in the sangria for free and came back with the drink i ordered. they were all very good but strong. the sushi was pretty standard they were yummy but nothing really stood out. we also had the poki appetizer which was awesome. reverse happy hour starts at 10pm so as soon as it was time we ordered a round of sake bombs since all their drinks are half off. we were getting the party started! =)  the only drawback to this place is that its not really close to anything else. it would be perfect if it was located in an area that was walking distance to other bars/lounges.',4
'Ive been meaning to make it out to Haus Murphys for a long time but it is just so far away from the East Valley where I live. Then when I saw it featured on a re-run of Diners Drive-Ins and Dives I decided I needed to make a trip. So today when I was in the neighborhood I decided to swing by to re-live the good old days I spent in Austria and Germany.  I stopped in for lunch and had the Paprika Schnitzel with German Potato Salad. It tasted exactly as I remember it from Germany and Austria.   The service was prompt and thorough (Thanks Tara!) and the atmosphere took me back. - A little slice of Germany in old-town Glendale.',5
'This place cant be beat in the downtown area in terms of creative yummy food relaxed atmosphere and fair prices.  Ive sampled about half of the menu and while the red curried noodles and veggies wasnt really spicy enough for me Ive otherwise thoroughly enjoyed everything!  The gypsy stew is probably what comfort food tastes like in heaven.',4
'Tiki Time! I highly recommend Hulas. The patio is fantastic with a firepit right in the middle. Happy hour (Tiki Time) features most of their drinks for only $5. The food was fabulous as well. Very casual environment and great place to spend an afternoon on the patio.',5
'Great time today with friends for breakfast at the Orange Table.  Omlettes French Toast Bacon Egg Sandwich Scrambled Eggs you name it we liked it all!  We sat out on the patio because we all brought dogs.  They greeted us with dog water bowls and made the dogs feel very welcome on their nice shady patio.  We will definitely be back.',5
'This place has been getting so much play lately Im starting to get a little jealous.  With the professional volleyball tour now located there and Jordin Sparks shows there every other day - its really turning into a hub for the Westside.   I went over there to meet a friend (from Surprise) to hangout as this was decided to be a good meeting point.  Westgate sports that whole faux-town square thing that is all the rage in American suburbia.  Youll find a grassy town square (with baby trees offering little to no shade) that kids and families actually hang out in.  Youll find actual middle class shops in contrast to Kierland Commons.   This place isnt exactly my cup of tea but people at the center seemed to be enjoying it as it was quite busy.  Its a loud bold monstrosity in what seems (at least now) to be the middle of nowhere - like an oasis in the middle of one GIANT parking lot.   The huge AMC movieplex and Renaissance Marriott hotel are the centerpieces here and chain restaurants abound here like Yard House Gordon Biersch and soon to be built Gardunos.    Its like a smaller version of Kierland with retail on the first floor and office on the upper floors but more isolated with not as many stores and with huge Times Square-like billboard ads EVERYWHERE.  It looks really TACKY.  I think if you even stand around long enough youll find a billboard on your back.',3
'I have to say Ive been a fan of Americas Taco Shop for as long as I can remember. I frequent the two Central Phoenix locations often and make sure to bring everyone there when they want amazing Al Pastor Guacamole or anything else.  I opened my mind to this location it is their first corp freestanding location since Kahala brought them under their umbrella. I was worried I cant lie. I generally have a closed mind to corp locations but I had to give this a shot given my history.   I walked in there ready to say this is nothing like ******. Instead I walked in and found a familiar face Terry. This comforted me and brought me back to reality I was safe and trusted them now.  Well I can report that everything tasted exactly how I expected. I got my usual to compare with the new location Al Pastor Burrito Guacamole and a Horchata. It was a 1 for 1 I tasted all the rich flavors that I was accustomed to and I was excited. I now have a location near my work and 2 near my home see you at lunch!',4
'Ok - so five stars? You ask . . .really for a small taco shop with a small menu? But here is why - I think that inexpensive eats are hard to find - especially ones that are worth eating at. But this is the place - I have tried a wide range of items on their menu - and this morning I ventured to Americas for a little breakfast burrito. Everything is always great!! Also - not over done or over complicated - just good simple food. Enough said!',5
'Been there twice both times Disappointed.  First visit I tired a sandwich Besides being well overpriced for what you get to begin with a friend with me asked for a little Balsamic vinegar however that would be an up charge.  Sodas come in bottles so if you drink more and one it of course cost you more.   The food was not bad but I would not describe it as great either the bead was hard to bite through tough and grilled hard on the outside.  Second time I was sort of dragged back in we a group was headed to another place when everyone besides me was all wanting to go try it.  So I go in with intentions of spending a bit more for a pasta dish remembering how I left hungry with a sandwich last time.  BAD IDEA I bought the Spaghetti very lack luster simple pasta and tomato sauce the noodles were cooked quite well but the sauce reminded me of that hunts canned sauce I use to by when I was on a tight budget fresh out of college.  Garlic bread.. oh wait I forgot no bread everything is up charged I didnt go past the 16 bucks I was already spending for the so so tiny portion of pasta I was already given and a soda. I figured I would be better off finding the vending machine in the office later for filler.  Bottom line for me Decent tasting food very small portions High prices will not return even if the group all decides thats where they are going again.  Why spend that much for lunch and still have to find something more to eat on the way back to the office?',2
'Had a buddy of mine take me and my wife here and I wasnt all that hungry because he likes to eat much earlier than I do. I loved the atmosphere and will definately try it again. I liked my dish but like I said I wasnt all that hungry.',4
'This was my first time here but I have always seen it when in the plaza. Boyfriend has been before and said it was awesome.  I had the steak and cheese with side salad and boyfriend had the gyro with fries. Both were awesome and the fries are my favorite kind. The place is small and wasnt packed but extremely clean. The service was nice and fast.  It was definitely fast food but good to have a different option than a chain. I would definitely go back and try other stuff on the menu since it all looked good.',5
'The Place: Im trying to come up with a good analogy to the size of this restaurant (and I use that term VERY loosely).  Lets just say that the Iron Chef in Queen Creek could easily fit in my garage its that small.  It is amazing what can come out of a cramped space.  The eat-in portion of the place has three booths and a small two person table.  The total diners that could eat in at the same time would be about 14 - and it would be a cramped fit.  The Food: The food was good a bit too much oil for my taste but not greasy in the slightest.  We ordered chicken lo mein for the kiddos and unfortunatley for them it was chock-a-block full of veggies and chicken. My kids havent discouvered the joys of stir fried veggies as yet - were working on it.  We also ordered chicken with broccoli with a white sauce which was an enormous portion and again everyone enjoyed.   Rounding out the feast was a roasted pork and chinese eggplant dish which was sweet and hot as well as a stir fried green bean plate.  We probably could have gotten away with ordering three dishes or a small size instead of all large.  Bonus for flexibility - you can order brown rice if you arent a fan of the fluffy white stuff.  The Bottom Line: I highly recommend Iron Chef for take out but I would avoid for eating in.  We were starving when we stopped in and didnt want to wait the 20 mins to drive home.  The proprietors were very friendly and willing to customize your order to pretty much anything you like.',3
'There are days when I wake up feeling a bit down. Its hard to describe the low mood but I think the best analogy would be a fleck of whale shit resting on the lowest part of the Continental Shelf.  Not even depression meds help when this mood hits.   I dont reach for my dads 50 caliber Desert Eagle. And I dont sit around thinking up flamboyant ways to off myself that will make all my friends like; Wow dude he really kissed himself with a fireplace poker?  Thinking this way accomplishes nothing other than the good feelings I get fantasizing about the many millions who showed up at my funeral and are now so distraught their lives will be in upheaval forever.  Theres only one remedy for me.  WalMart.  WalMart is the place where I go for solace.  To remind myself that I have all my teeth I dont have a bubble-butt with a ledge (in yoga pants) that I know the difference between Armani and Martha Stewart I can count without the aid of my digits I dont breathe through my mouth and I know enough to not wear a tie-dyed beater two sizes two small exposing my midriff.  If there was ever such thing as comfort food for the brain this is it.   God bless America and Sam Walton his billionaire heirs and heiresses and all the uber-losers who shop there and while doing so  unknowingly recharge my self esteem batteries.  Note: I dont mean to imply everyone who shops at WalMart is an uber loser. Theyre not.  Its more akin to spotting a punch-buggy in traffic.  Theyre there. You know theyre there. You just need to scour the aisles until you find one....hitting self esteem gold.',5
'Crackers has been a long term staple for me held over from my days as a Mesa resident. You just cant go wrong here.   Offering breakfast and lunch everything on the menu sounds delicious and everything ive had was even better. Id love to be able to say that ive tried everything but lets be real here- its a big menu.   Crackers offers an average of six different soup selections every day with one or two daily specials. Same with dessert- daily selections may vary. Both are homemade- no boxes or cans here- and they taste like the best thing your mom ever made for you only maybe a little better. (assuming your mother was a good cook)   The breakfast offerings are hearty and full of flavor the lunch offerings run the gamut from light snack to full blown food coma material. Great stuff.   Like Meredith said the decor isnt anything special- it hasnt changed much in the 15 years or so since  I first ate here. I think theyre going for homey country charm. It doesnt matter though- this isnt a place to go for ambiance unless youre a reclusive Mormon housewife.   Crackers has two other locations- one out in east Mesa and one in Tempe. I havent been to either of those but this one is definitely a winner.',5
'I am an avid sushi diner and used to work at a sushi place as well. Soooo I always like to check out different sushi spots and see how they compare.  I was so pleased. The selection of fish and seafood was by far one of the best specializing in more rare plates (usually more common to real sushi bars).  I had thier oysters(amazing) giant clam which is not as scary as it sounds monkfish live pate (very good not for the faint at heart) plus many other delicacies.  They were all good each in their own way.  We tried okamase (I hope I spelled that right) and the owner came over and introduced himself to us.  He told us that his resturaunt was all about bringing some of his favorite dishes to az that he enjoyed while growing up in Japan.  I have to say it was expensive but well worth the whole experience and I will be back!!!!',5
'Noca Noca Noca...Ive been wanting to try you for a while..but with child in tow..I was sceptical about trying you out....do I heart you to death right now? yes! K...so lets rock the nitty gritty...I ate there a few hours ago and HAD to share...   When I walked in they totally didnt even bat an eye that my daughter(8) was with me...patrons however gave me the look...little did they know she was totally in the kitchen later with the chef makin their little cloud of heaven...   Ok..so the most phenom wait / bus staff ever! EVER!!!! I applaud you!! If I could have raised a glass to all of you and thought the some what persnickety crowd would follow I would have. But  you know the Arcadia crowd... God forbid..they acknowledge where they came from and may be again ...anyway..hats off to the training and ridiculous management skills you have developed!   Like I always tell anyone I have ever dated...its the small things that count ( d--- exclude) and attention to detail ...NOCA covers it all.... the teeny mad hatter tea cups with soup and the perfect olive oil dipping trays.. I dont heart much these days....serious..check this sh-- out..fo real!   If I could put up with the dbag letch next to me for this....you know ..;or please know..NOCA deserves a visit.   The kitchen was a tad slow but they were slammed all at once..and its actually nice to have a slow meal and give each coarse the attention it deserves...they made up for the wait by bringing Little Tea Cups of Pea Soup and Corn Soup which I snagged from my daughter...then a bowl of tomato gazpacho..(which I couldnt eat as I am allergic to tomatoes) the waitress did not bat an eye..she whisked it away...and replaced it with an asparagus toasted pine nut salad..yummy! (All of this was complimentary)..   I had an Ultimate Vodka Martini..fabu! Nice Cozy  little 6 seat bar..if the dining room looks crowded look a little further back to your left and see if you can squeeze in there..good seats and a bird eye view of the crowd.   k...so..the lobster ( pronounced) LOBSTAAAAA roll only on Wed. ..I was all trying to be healthy and not eat as a sandwich at 1st...and it was ok...then I picked it up and had the whole enchilada ....f--- me all the way to heaven and back...you have no idea...I thought about not telling you for like 2 point 4 seconds flat..then decided if you want to have the big O..get off your ass and go....just stuff the big ass delight in your face..boss date Mom lookin at you...doesnt matter ..you will thank me later.   I have had to cut a lot of food out of my life lately...but NOCA was like ...whatever..bring it on bitch...Thank you for rockin my pallet tonight!   The chef...so inventive on every level....the food speaks volumes... but what rocked me was the manager asking my daughter to meet the chef and go in the kitchen to help make the little puffs of heaven .... wait for it....wait for it....home made right then and there-COTTON CANDY! My all time favorite childhood treat. I renamed them Rockin Heaven Puffs last night. They bring them out after your meal....and theyll bring you 2..not that I would know... or anyone else they were gone so fast..I think I licked the bowl...oh geez do over.  NOCA....you are the date I dream about!  If yelp had an O rating ...you would have it tonight!',5
'Ive been to this location three times now and cant say enough good things about it. Like someone else said Ive spent a lot more on massages that werent nearly as good.  Both of my masseuses have been excellent. I like very light pressure and tend to get therapists who think theyre using light pressure but they still want to work you over. If I feel pain during a massage Im not going to be relaxed! However both of them were great and really listened to what I wanted. The only reason I didnt stay with the first one is because she doesnt do 2 hr massages which I really wanted for the next visit. I would stay with the second one except for the situation noted below.  On my last visit. I showed up all ready for my two hour massage only to find that my masseuse Brooke doesnt do prenatal massage (Im 5 wks). Rather than continue she stopped the appointment before we started and explained why they handle prenatal the way they do. She didnt make me feel bad for not calling ahead and asking and even apologized because she didnt do this kind of massage. Now she was out a two-hour appointment and tip because of it. I will miss her and highly recommend her.  The front desk tried to reschedule me for another therapist later in the week but it would have meant changing estheticians for my facial which I didnt want to do. I decided to come back the same day for my scheduled facial but before I left a therapist who does do prenatal came to talk to me. She had an opening right then but wanted to tell me more about the massage and what kinds of things I should consider first. I decided not to do it because I wanted to talk to my dr first (ME actually recommended no massages until at least the 2nd trimester). I will definitely ask for her when I can schedule my next appointment though. Anyway I honestly felt like they cared about me as a recurring client and were looking out for my best interests.  Ive had the same esthetician Cynthia all three times and shes fantastic. I enjoy talking with her throughout and shes very thorough. My skin always feels great afterwards and I think the treatments have helped a lot with various skin problems I have. She also gives a very nice scalp arm and hand massage during the facial. I like that if youre getting a massage and facial together you can actually stay in the same room/bed - no need to get up get dressed and traipse to another location.  The last thing to note was that when I signed up for the membership in Feb I got a free one-hour massage coupon. I forgot to bring it to my March appointment but the front desk said just to bring it to my next visit. When I dug out the coupon I found it expired on 3/31. ME was still willing to take it though and applied it to my facial.  Regarding the sales pitch: On my first visit I was determined not to sign up for the membership (kind of like visiting a new gym or sitting in on a timeshare presentation!) but knowing I would go at least monthly the prices were worth it. Ive also purchased a few products based on their recommendations which have been pretty good although a little expensive (an eye cream for about $70). Just be prepared and ask questions before you pay.  Also their quiet room is very small and not so quiet when its busy and people are talking. Fortunately I dont spend much time in there and once youre in the room you cant hear any outside noise.  Happy to continue vistiing this place especially since its less than a mile from my house!',5
'What a cool place. You can either sit and be served in the dining area or order sandwiches and salads to go or eat those outside on the front patio. Did a lunch group here for a buddys birthday and we enjoyed ourselves.  I ordered the mediterranean salad w/ chicken and it was great! Delicious very healthy (not the typical overloaded salad you buy at chain restaurants) good size and I wasnt under the spell of a carb coma the rest of the afternoon!',5
'My wife and I had our date night at the Esplanade for the first time since its renovation.  I was surprised at the changes made to the place.  Gone was the old ticket booth and the lobby/concession stand area was turned into a bar lounge type atmosphere.  Looked like a cool spot to hang out and wait for your movie if you were early or even to it and chat if on a date after the movie.  You can purchase your tickets at the automated machines or buy/pick them up inside at Guest Services.    The employees were very cordial as we passed them on our way to our seats inside the theater.  We decided on the Cinema Suites since it was 21&over.  We were impressed with the layout and the very comfortable seats that recline.  Our server was very nice and informative.  I was surprised when she was entering our order into her pad the other servers were bring our drinks and appetizers.  WOW!  Thats faster and more impressive than a restaurant.    I had the sirloin tips and mashed potatos and my wife had the fried shrimp with fries.  I cant comment on any mixed drinks (another reviewer complained of watered down drinks) mainly because we had wine.   All in all it was ok.  Kinda like food at an Applebees or Chilis.  Nothing to go crazy about mediocre and over priced but it WAS a MOVIE THEATER.  I mean Its not a Michelin Star restaurant.  I dont care that it is in the Biltmore area.  The thing that annoyed us the most were the 2 pompous couples we sat between.  They constantly complained about something.  Mostly their refills.  The waitress explains to you should you need something PUSH the call button.  They never did.  They expected someone to come by.  The point of the call button is to minimize the wait staff running around disturbing patrons who are watching the movie.    This is the main reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. They were really annoying.   Its like this.......You are at a THEATER that serves food and drinks.  Not at a Fancy restaurant that shows a movie.  Youre paying for the comfort and experience of being able to relax enjoy a drink or dinner all while watching a movie.  Bottom line Food was ok a little over priced so watch what or how much you order.  If you like to drink have a beer wine or straight drink if you are so worried of getting it watered down.  The employees from beginning to end were excellent.  And the over all experience was very enjoyable and fun.  We would definitely do it again real soon.',4
'Meh.  Had the filet and it was a little bland.  My salmon was very fishy.',2
'Chile rellenos make me pretty happy! Oh theyre amazing here too. You should take me...',4
'I love this place!',5
'Loved this restaurant!  The soup (lobster bisque) was amazing and I had the pulled BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was very tasty!  My son had the kids grilled cheese sandwich and the Wisconsin Cauliflower soup.  My meal came with bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry and my sons just had the strawberry.  Every sandwich soup and salad can be customized with different toppings and mix-ins.    They have incredible desserts there...brownies cheesecake tarts..etc.  I had one of the brownies and it was fresh and delicious.  And they have fun Italian soda mix-in flavors for your soda.  They are moderately priced and the food was great!  Im looking forward to going back there again.',5
'I came better prepared this year. From the previous review you could tell I was absolutely livid about the parking situation so this time instead of exiting on Indian Bend my friends and I exited earlier on Pima Rd and took Hayden up to the parking area. There was still a long line but faster than waiting an hour in the car last year.   There was group yoga warm ups at around 6:30 and again at 7:00am which made it a nice way to start the cold brisk morning with a stretch. Everyone was suffering because it was so cold this time but moving around made it better.  Now that Im a more seasoned runner I did the 15K instead of the 5K which is about 9.3 miles. This was my first experience being in the first corral of runners too which was kind of intimidating for some reason even though it was a fun run. One of the girls was in a specialized wheel chair so she even had a 1 minute head start but she flew like the wind leading the way.   I was expecting actual hot chocolate along the run this time because of rumors but instead there was tons of Gatorade stations. If you didnt want Gatorade there was also water available and port-a-pottys at each station. The one chocolate stop I was looking forward too was not hot chocolate. Instead it was just Godiva candy. Even though I was slightly disappointed I survived.   I layered on so much clothing because it was so cold that I felt overwhelmed during the run after the first mile. I now will never run with a hoodie over a long sleeved shirt over an undershirt so thats one thing I might change next year.   The course itself was nice. Nothing extraordinary. Running through Scottsdale is always nice since there are plenty of trees lining the way. You even ran past the Butterfly World building during the run. There are a couple of hair pin turns on the run so that was my only complaint. It wouldnt been alot easier if they rounded those couple of turns a bit better.',4
'Matts Big Breakfast was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives.   Ive been to some of the top rated breakfast spots in the country and have to say that Matts ranks right up there as one of the best.  I ordered the Waffle which comes with Bacon and also ordered a side of Hash Browns. The food all tasted very fresh and amazing and you could tell a lot of thought was put into every detail.   The Waffle- A large Belgium style waffle that was fluffy and cooked to perfection. I love the little metal syrup container that comes on the side and contains the perfect amount of warm syrup.  The Bacon- The best bacon Ive ever had!  Thick perfectly cooked and the right amount of pepper coating.  Hash Browns- Awesome! Im a big hash brown fan and these are really good. Perfectly cooked with an amazing fresh taste.  Most of the top rated breakfast places that Ive been to are ranked high for their delicious and creative breakfast items. Matts gets five stars because they take the traditional breakfast staples and serve them to perfection.',5
'This place is an outlet mall. They have just about every store you usually find at an outlet mall and more. There is also food and theaters with an IMAX. This place was near our resort on the south mountain side of Phoenix. With a little time to kill and always a need to shop we ventured in. Ok so this place is not 5th avenue. The area surrounding the mall is not exactly the best part of town. And its outlets. It draws masses of people mainly those who need to pay less for what they buy (was that PC enough?). We did not feel uncomfortable or put out by the people around us though some of the children are just RUDE and not disciplined at all.   We had a few things on our shopping lists and then needed a little bite to eat. The mall had some great places. There was a bath and body works outlet that had some great prices. I would have bought more if I could have fit it all in the suitcase. There was also Gap Oakley JCPenney Off 5th Nordstroms Billabong and more. Stuff I usually do not see at the outlets and a welcomed change.   The place is huge and a big circle with a cut through the middle in case you just cant do it all. The food choices are pretty decent. The theater also offered quite a few movies and several choices for the IMAX too. We would have seen something if the times had worked out better for us.   I think you should go see shop here if you have things you are looking for are not afraid of crowds are not intimidated by people who NEED to shop at the outlets and want to see cheaper versions of your favorite stores that you havent seen in outlet form before.',4
'Great Service especially at the bar!  Fabulous Zaya Rum tastes as good as cognac.  Food to die for.  No complaints here.  Relaxed carefree resort-like feel.',5
'Fresh subs that have good portions of meat and veggie to bread.  The subs are untoasted so they taste more cool and refreshing rather than crispy and hot.  There is a pretty good selection of toppings to choose from such as mushrooms bell peppers tomato etc.  The interior is really old school with wood panel counter and older style decor.  I really feel like a mining prospector could come in here order a sub and feel right at home.  Service was fast and friendly although the sub maker messed up the order a bit and added an ingredient I didnt want and forgot an ingredient I actually wanted.  Johnny Cash was playing in the background which also added to the old school feel and I got a brief musical history lesson from the cashier/sub guy who told me he recorded the song in Folsom prison.  The sub itself was about $6 for a medium and while it isnt the best sub Ive had it was decent and a good choice if I am looking for a sandwich late at night.',3
'This little shop gave some surprises. First I didnt expect it is such a small shop. You cannot believe such a tiny eatery enjoy a high a reputation; second the food is really good. The shrimp taco is a really delight. It is worthwhile my efforts to make a special detour to this restaurant during my trip  to Grand Canyon.',4
'So weve been hearing all sorts of buzz about Culvers.. the famous butter burger and frozen custard place from Wisconsin. So we piled in the car and headed out to Mesa. When we got there the place was packed.. we stood in line for 10 minutes before it was our turn. The service is very friendly and super helpful. We even ordered the flavor of the day caramel cashew swirls and were told we could pick that up later so it didnt melt while we ate our dinner.. that was very cool!  Anyway you place your order and they give you a number so they can bring it out to you when its ready.. another nice touch. Well after we got our food butter burgers fries and cheese curds we felt well kind of let down. The burgers here are alright kinda greasy and lacked a good beef flavor. The cheese curds were also deep fried (as most on the menu) and were good but not as good as I was hoping.   The crowd there.. it was like I was in Iowa or something.. definite Walmart crowd.. I sat there and watched this kid pick his nose and then proceed to fill his soda cup from the soft drink fountain.. uhm yeah.. I just looked at my cup and thought about all the other people who touched that button.. suddenly didnt feel very good.   We got our frozen custards.. eh very very smooth and creamy but to me just tasted like ordinary soft serve ice cream. Cashews were salty and nicely roasted a good contrast to the smooth custard but lack depth and interest in the overall taste of the frozen custard.  I probably wouldnt ever go back here.. though the service is great and is priced well I just dont think the food was worth the drive back out to Mesa.',2
'I am an Arizona native now living in Dallas Texas and all I can say is it is about time Phoenix began to compete with other large metropolitan areas that have light rail service.   On a recent trip back home for a belated birthday excursion I had an opportunity to ride the rail downtown to see a comedy show. The train was clean (for public transportation) and graffiti free. I found the honor system of paying for a ticket a little silly since it is my understanding this project was mucho expensive but hey I understand you have to find a way to entice those car loving drivers somehow.  Unfortunately for us the first night I rode the rail with a friend it broke down 2 stops from our destination. After sitting at the station for 10 minutes with no announcement from the driver we figured out we probably werent going anywhere anytime soon. When we walked past the conductors car he just shrugged his shoulders and mouthed the words Its broke. Gee do you think you could have told us that over the intercom without us having to walk up and tap on your window?   On the plus side the majority of people on the train were going to the NRA convention so walking downtown at night could not have been safer (and made for interesting people watching).  Post Script: After the show we caught the train back and the ride went without a hitch. The light rail gets 3 stars for the quick save in the bottom of the 9th inning.',3
'If youre itching for cheap down-n-dirty quick eats that taste nothing like authentic Mexican fare this is your stop!  Taco Bell is the bomb - even back in the 80s! I mean who can resist those crunchy tacos? So delish.   It is especially good after a wild night out. I can honestly say that if you eat Taco Bell when youre intoxicated and you go to bed youll feel pretty damn good in the AM. It makes me laugh when I find shredded cheese and tomato bits on my coffee table in the morning from my 2:30am feeding frenzy. Silly wabbit!',5
'On a warm Saturday afternoon I was shocked to discover the popularity of OHSO.  The back patio was slammed with customers day drinking at 2pm.  A very good sign for any bar.  The reason this microbrewery may be popular is probably because OHSO serves great beer.  Im not just talking about what they brew on site but theres a massive selection of craft beers from other microbreweries in Arizona and from around the world.  If youre looking for Bud Light do yourself a favor and go to any other bar in the country.  If youre looking for something other than beer there is a decent selection of mixed drinks.   Having never been to OHSO I decided I should have one of their own and the Citrus Nitro caught my attention after the server called it a creamsicle.  What a perfect description of what the beer tastes like.  Would you believe a beer flavored like a creamsicle is delicious?  It is.  I also tried the White Chocolate Ale from the Sonoran Brewing Company in Scottsdale.  Also delicious.  Service was great.  I was with a group of about 15 to 20 people and the waitress had no problem keeping our tabs straight.  There were also tray filled with water glasses constantly delivered to the table without request.  Something desperately needed on a 90 degree day.  The server also was really knowledgeable about the beers on the menu.',4
'Great Pho and other dishes also. They have recently been bought by another company and the last time I went there I left pretty pissed. The food was as good as always but the two little tiny server boys SUCKED. They walked around with phone in one hand and food in the other. I told the owner and hopefully this was addressed.',4
'If youre looking for a quazi-healthy fast casual lunch spot Zoes is your spot. Its easy and great for a work week lunch. Its nothing that exciting from an ambiance perspective but the food is good (not great) it does the trick and wont break the bank.    I usually get the chicken salad sandwich which carmelized onions. My girlfriend always gets the protein plate which looks good too. Plus every item comes with chips and a side of your choice (slaw potato salad pilaf etc.)  My favorite part about Zoes you ask? That Diet Dr. Pepper is part of the soda fountain selection. Divine.',3
'The service here is good but thats as good as it gets. The salsa is disgusting the food is bland and unidentifiable and its just generally annoying',2
'Found myself here on a Friday night after a few friends suggested it. Lucky for us our friends gave us a good suggestion.  The atmosphere is cool - a vintage/modern look. The restaurant in located in what looks to be an old brick home. I wanted to see more of the inside but it was really nice outside so we decided to sit on their equally nice patio. The staff was nice enough. But the food was the best part. Good quality ingredients paired well together.',4
'If this joint had literally ANY other name I would give them 5 stars.  Seriously. Yummy bagels with FREE REFILLS on your ice coffee AND soy milk!!!!!!!! What??? Yes you did just read that. Free. Their bagels are fine but they aint back east.',4
'If you go here get a gift card from restaurant.com. They always have specials so you get 50%-70% off the cards. It ends up costing you $3 when you get a $25 gift card to this place. So worth it.',4
'I was excited to try this place out because I love sushi. We made a reservation online for 6pm so we could be there for happy hour which ends at 7. We get there exactly at 6 and they tell us there are two tables in front of us that need to be seated that called in. So we go to the bar and get drinks and wait...and wait...and wait...its 6:30. We ask how much longer until we get a table and they respond  We dont know no tables have left since you have got here. I ask the manager how much longer until we get a table or if we can wait and get an extended happy hour when seated? He responded No you can sit at the open table outside or I am going to seat the people behind you who have been waiting. You didnt say you preferred to sit inside or outside online (which there wasnt an option for). ITS 115 DEGREES OUTSIDE. No we dont want to sit outside. We decided to leave and call Pearl to see if they had any open seating. They said we cant make reservations under 6 people but we will hold this table for you anyways. LOVE YOU PEARL GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.',1
'I was in search for the best burger in Tempe and Im positive this place is it. It has a decent size menu. Burgers hot dogs and The Italian Beef are their specialties.  1st time there I ordered just a regular burger with the works.Grilled onions are a must! Trust me.  Bun was fresh burger was juicy right into the first bite. Im not a big fan of crinkle cut fries but these were decent. They had this special dipping sauce that kinda reminded me of the Big Mac Sauce. All in all real good food. My combo was around $9 but it was worth it. Definitely a must try',4
'Lechon!  I had heard of this delicious pork dish from watching travel shows and was excited to see they sold it here.  I got a pound to go and it was all that I hoped it would be!  The pork is slow roasted for a long time to get a very crispy and crunchy skin kind of like a pork chip!  The meat was very tender and full of flavor (And fat!  Dont think for a minute this is healthy for you!)  They included a special tangy-sweet gravy to dip the lechon in which was wonderful.  I did not try any of the pastries but they did look delectable.  They also sell chicharron for those that want to snack on something pork-like as well.    The lady at the counter was very nice and friendly.  If I want to go into a pork-coma again this is the place to go!  Lechon: $8.50 per pound sold on the weekends Chicharron: ~$2 for 2 ounces',4
'My favorite place to sit down and eat asian food.  Very unique and original flavors.... I have been here 6 times already and will continue for sure.',4
'i have some muscle spasms that i use to go to physical therapy for.. and when Im really stressed i can feel the knots forming.. its horrible...   well i started here not to long ago.. and Ive had a different person each time... the therapist are very well trained and know what they are doing.. which is a breath of fresh air!! the rooms are so clean and relaxing with nice calming music... all the personnel are very calm helpful and respectful to all of your needs :)   they have this Relaxation Room that you wait for you massage in.... and it has comfy couches and dim lighting.. and the relaxation music... i love it!   when they take you back they ask you what sort of massage your looking for relaxation deep tissue Swedish or if you have any special issues.. like injuries and such... that way you get a custom massage each time you go! and its always amazing!!!   after your massage they leave the room to allow you to dress and are waiting in the main hall for you with a fresh cup of water! :) and then they walk you out :) its charming!   the bathroom is fully equipped with mouth wash lotion hand sanitizer... and so on... :)   over all i love this place... going for a two hour massage soon... ill be sure to do another review :)',5
'Place is pretty filthy. Yet Im not here to enjoy the ambiance and decor. There was what appeared to be blood on the wall.',1
'My husband and I frequent sports bars since we are both sports nuts and sometimes watching a game at home by ourselves is a little dull. Saturday afternoon we were starting to go a bit stir crazy at home so we decided to check out Upper Deck Sports Grill to watch the Jag/Pats playoff game.   The only reason I am not giving this place one star is that there were tons of TVs with a variety of sporting events playing and I liked the two level idea. We sat on the second level at this mini bar that lines the balcony so we would have a great view of the two huge projection screens that were showing the football game.  Other than that I have nothing positive to say about Upper Deck.  The service was horrific...my husband actually had to go to the bar on the second level to get our drinks and order our food because while there were waitresses walking around they never came over to us.  The food was incredibly mediocre...I ordered the kickin chicken wrap...I am still trying to figure out what was kicking about it.  My husband got the chicken burrito and he didnt care for it.  The menu is really lackluster and not much about it envokes the sports bar idea.  The beer prices were a tad high for the most part but our 64 oz. Bud Lite pitchers were $8.50 which we didnt think was too bad.  One of the most odd things about Upper Deck is the hodge podge assortment of universities or teams that claim the bar as their viewing place for games...Georgia Tech Kansas Virginia Tech Michigan State and the Philadelphia Eagles all had banners hanging up...weird.  What the common bond between them all is I have no clue.  Needless to say I will not be making a trip back to Upper Deck anytime in the future.',2
'Wow the number of flat screens in this bar would impress the football gods!  I felt really welcomed when I visited Blue 32 -- it wasnt too rowdy nor too quiet either.    I ordered the Black and Blue burger which definitely hit the spot.  Though I do need to get my butt back to the gym.  Regardless bleu cheese and bacon on a burger -- how can you say No!?  It was cooked perfectly and with fat yummy fries on the side.  Didnt order a drink unfortunately this time since my weekend hangover was still lingering haha!    Service was okay; we were greeted with a smile.  Though Im always irked when I have to wait for my water to be filled but all is well.  The ambience was real chill for a sports bar but like I said not too rowdy is good for me.  I like the spot lighting and the booth and bar separation was perfect. - Enjoy!',4
'When I first entered the W Scottsdale I braced myself for the cheesy club music that Ive developed a love-hate relationship with at my home away from home the W in San Francisco. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately) I wasnt greeted with such music at the W Scottsdale.   I was greeted with friendly ladies at the front desk a spacious room and of course lovely bliss products.  During my 48 hours in Scottsdale I didnt spend very much time outside my hotel room although I did get a few glimpses of the pool. Once while working out in the adequate gym and another time while ordering some grub at the pool bar. While I didnt get to experience the pool scene myself this is obviously the place to be.  Ive stayed a few other hotels in Scottsdale (Firesky Valley Ho and my favorite Montelucia). The W suits me well when it comes to work purposes since my office is located in the building behind the W. People may not walk in Scottsdale but its so close that it would be pathetic to drive. Looks like this W may end up becoming my home away from home while in Scottsdale.',4
'Great service took the time to check my car battery and inform that it could be recharged unlike ORiellys who wanted to sell me a $120 battery',5
'Went in w my birthday email for free pizza. Waiter was great.  Just had iced tea & soda.  Pizza was delicious as usual Left tip as if bill had $16 pizza incl Dont want to short-change staff',5
'I frequent Nordstrom cafe for lunch almost once a week.  Although the food is outstanding the service is what keeps me loyal.  Each time I go an employee named Rick recognizes me and immediately takes care of me and my guests like a 5 star dining establishment.  He is attentive and always remembers what we drink etc.  I have never seen such a dedicated employee who clealry cares about his customers and takes the upmost pride in his job  He always makes our dining experience remarkable.  I highly recomend visiting this wonderful cafe and if you are lucky Rick will be your server.  He really is a gem!!!!',5
'My new favorite hip spot. You cant get better than Windsor.',5
'I cant believe I havent  reviewed this place. It is number 1 on my breakfast go to places. I like everything about Liberty Market. From the historical  Market door used as a white board posting specials as you walk in to the hanging Edison bulb lighting to the  exposed brick it just screams cool. It is not a chain and the food is delicious. Be warned the portions are huge so we usually split a meal. The scrambles are delish. Just had the Sicilian today three eggs onion mozzarella tomato and Italian sausage. Yum.  Special shout out to the creatively decorated mixed gender bathrooms and free wifi!!!',5
'This is a review for the Banfield Pet Hospital.  Riley (the famous ROTD dog) and I came here for her rabies vaccination and had a very easy and pleasant experience. We made an appointment since theyre pretty busy and were shown in only a few moments after the scheduled time.   Checking in was very easy considering how all of the staff are extremely friendly and kind and most importantly- patient.   Let me tell you dogs do not like it when you put things up their butt. The nurse who took Rileys temperature was extremely kind with her and the ordeal went very smoothly.   Just two or three minutes later the doctor came in to administer the shot. She spoke sweetly and calmly to Riley to ease her discomfort and really took her time to make sure she was ready and prepared for the shot.  Afterwards she was thorough in explaining what to watch for in case there was a negative reaction.   Checking out was simple and they made copies of everything I needed.  wooffff growf howwwlll bark Riley says she highly recommends this location for all your pet doctoring needs!',5
'Wings are the only good thing about this place.  Wife and son both hate the food and they dont like wings.',2
'First time at St. Francis last night. Good menu selection had an excellent server good portion size and excellent meal.  I tried the chicken salad for dinner and it was tasty and just then right size.  They have provided a nice atmosphere with exposed brick stainless steel tables and just the right amount of lighting and music.    Only downside was the backless seats at our booth. Very trendy but somewhat uncomfortable. Ask for a table instead and youll be fine.   Ill return.',4
'I always get the fries because theyre good. Try the onion rings! They may be even better!! Stil love this place and so grateful to have them for late night eats in my hood!',5
'Im married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. Ive been to Japan I dont know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class Id even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. Im not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.',5
'THIS PLACE IS WAY TOO BIG!!! I think its a bad thing but others love  this place. I like most guys hate furniture shopping but this takes it to a whole new level. You could seriously get lost in this place. It is a giant two story maze but at the end of this maze youve spent a nominal fee for a bunch of garbage furniture or your life savings for something a little higher quality. I went in there not knowing what to expect of the place being it my first time in an ikea yes i know ive been sheltered but in this case im very thankful. Back to the subject at hand I went in there not knowing what i was about to get myself into. Grab the map a paper measuring tape and a cheap wooden pencil just because they were free. Proceeded up the escalator to the showroom. No wonder the store has to be so big they carry the most insane amount of furniture ive ever seen. They have such a variety of furniture which im told is good im just a simple man. So the first hour of the store was quite exciting because their is so much furniture to loook at and try on. But then another hour passed and another until i looked at my watch and realized i was trapped in this god forsaken maze for 4 hours. Just as i got to the end of the showroom my world was rocked. I thought i was finished for the day....boy was i wrong. I now had to go find the furniture i liked and get it myself. That took another solid hour bringing us up to 5 hours on the day. After I had to flag down one of the few employees that were ever visible and gathered up all the furniture came checkout. Looked like disney world. Had people directing traffic and the worst part is the self checkout. Some people act like theyve never touched a piece of technology past the creation of a speek and spell. This just added to the total amount of time spent in this store. 5 hours and 45 mins. I must say if you have the patience for shopping all day and like variety this is the place for you.',3
'Stopped in to this beautiful little restaurant with a good friend. It was a splurge our taste buds kind of day...so why not do it with French cuisine on a rainy day. We started off with the Escargot. It was good but I have had better. For my entree I had the steak frites and risotto. Then finished our meal with a creme brûlée. All were EXCEPTIONAL! The service was great and really friendly.   I recommend getting reservations on open table. Convenient and easy!  Go for special occasions!!! OR if you dont mind dropping a bit more $$ then no ones stopping ya...its worth it!',4
'Alright this is the scoop. This place is more hit than miss depends whether youre here to study or hang out.  The drinks and food are good but the trick is to find a place to sit.  If the place is packed youre screwed. By the way they keep their bathrooms in tip top shape. Always good.',4
'I took my Wheaton Terrier there for a groom and was pleased the moment I walked in the door.  The shop was clean peaceful and the lady at the front desk was so nice.    It was easy to be an appointment and she was ready when they said she would be.  She looked amazing and they groomed her exactly as I requested.  When I am in Glendale I will go no where else!',5
'I had a great time last year and look forward to this years event!',4
'I loved staying at the Wigwam.  We had stayed at the Clarendon not too long before (read the Clarendon review) and we needed a totally different experience.  The staff was very courteous at check in and asked if we were celebrating anything important which we werent (just a little stay-cation) but my wife did explain that we had a horrible stay at the Clarendon earlier.  I think this prompted them to go out of their way to make us feel even more welcome. They gave us the rundown on anything we needed and insisted that we call for anything at all.  Our room was in a duplex type villa on the far side of the property by the golf course but the staff made sure to let us know that if we needed to get around the property they would send a golf cart for us.  The room was spotless and the bed was something I could sleep on forever with luxurious bedding.  The grounds are beautifully kept and the pools are amazing.  Poolside service for drinks was wonderful even if you just want some water.  Just an overall amazing experience with too much to actually write down.   What kills me is that we have lived on the West Side for 10 years now and had never gone to the Wigwam before that.  Well I think that trend is over now.',5
'Call me a hater but you all are brainwashed.   Edit: changed my review to two stars to be a little more fair.  I will start off by saying this is by far the best restaurant the Clarendon has had yet though that isnt saying much considering their track record. The place is very unassuming and actually has a very comfortable feel. We were absolutely confused where to go when we walked into the restaurant. You cant tell where the bar ends and the dining room begins and they dont have a set up hostess stand (the one they have is in the middle of the room) which you can easily find. Our hostess looked at us oddly for a couple of seconds before I let her know were here for dinner......  After being seated our server came over and we told her it was our first time and needed her help choosing. She described everything to sound absolutely delicious so we ordered away. I started out with the Picolo a drink made with jalapeno tequila lime and muddled seasonal fruit. Sounds delicious but this is where the night took a turn for the worst. I took a taste and just about dropped my glass and my head twitched.... it was so tart it was undrinkable. Im a guy who likes my sour candy and sour anything but this was almost painful to drink. I told the server and she started laughing and apparently assumed I was kidding???   I ordered three tacos and a side of rice. I first tried the Cochinita which I have to say was an absolutely butchered dish. Does this white boy need to go over and give lessons to you people about how to properly cook a Mexican dish? YOU DO NOT PUT GUACAMOLE ON COCHINITA PIBIL. You also dont used tough chopped pork. You use shredded and slow roasted pork. You dont put chunks of fruit in it either. You ruined one of the greatest Mexican dishes of all time. The Carne Asada had a wonderfully textured and tender quality but fell flat on its face when it came to flavor of which it had none. I tried the Ahi Tuna taco as well which also was covered in guacamole. You cant just cover all of your food in guacamole and pass it as mexican unless you are trying to hide a lack of skill in the kitchen. I ate my guacos (not tacos) begrudgingly.   My girlfriend ordered the guacamole and proclaimed it to be completely average but Id have to say otherwise. I took a bite on a chip only to find a big chunk of orange slice. Really? People order this and then come back and order it again? This is actually the second Mexican dish youve managed to butcher after the cochinita pibil. I wont even start on the rice which was not cooked properly was covered in cilantro... and I mean COVERED and was borderline cold.   Service here is good enough but I had the feeling the whole time that our server was simply going through the motions. When she laughed and told me she was glad I liked the drink I was complaining about all the way to the end when she asked why we didnt finish the guacamole and couldnt understand why we werent licking the bowl she just flat out was off.   The meal was absolutely a bastardization of the Mexican cuisine. You all are trying to damned hard to be cute and made yourself look like inexperienced buffoons in the kitchen. I have to tell you that this place is probably only surviving because it caters to a niche and because some yelp superstar decided they like it and all their sheep friends followed. If this place had to survive on its own in the real world (outside its Im to hip to go anywhere that cool people wont see me atmosphere) it would fall flat on its face just like every other restaurant this hotel has dreamt up.',2
'Nice place with great ambiance and a nice vibe. Very laid back and casual. The lavosh is great the patio is pretty sweet in the fall and winter. Staff is not the brightest or friendliest but also dont upsell or pressure you. Overall its a great place to chillax and have some good noshies with your BeBu or shortie.  DONT BRING YOUR KIDS THEY HAVE A WINDOWLESS VAN PARKED OUT FRONT YOU CAN LEAVE THEM IN.',3
'This was our first time going to Someburros.  Ive heard lots of people talk about it but until recently had never eaten any of their food.  We recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from Someburros.  We were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves.  We went on Sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go.  The chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home.  The hot sauce IS tasty.    The service is horrible at this place!  The server was annoyed by our questions was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working.  We felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service.    Despite the close proximity to our home we wont be going back to this restaurant.   Rather well be going to Chilis for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix!',1
'Im not a huge chain restaurant fan. I avoid them like the plague but I bit the bullet and went to Carrabas and was pleasantly surprised. We had the 3 course feast thing. It was a great value and very tasty but the best thing about the meal was Jordan our waiter. He was so friendly am extremely knowledgable. All in all a nice experience.',5
'I took 2 coats in to be altered. On the first coat only the sleeves were to be shortened. On the second coat the sleeves and the coat length were to be shortened.  We my daughter (whos coats these were) and I returned to Tonys a week later to pick up both coats. My daughter tried on the first coat that only needed the sleeves shortened and she looked a bit apprehensive and a bit perplexed. But none-the-less she opted to take the coat as she was leaving back to college and needed the coat. When we left Tonys my daughter commented that it didnt feel right in the sleeves as if it was bunching and it felt uncomfortable to her. I told her to leave it but she insisted that she would need a coat.  The second coat that needed both the sleeves and length shortened was left there because they said it wasnt ready and would be another week. When I returned a week later to pick up the coat it was very visible to me that the job was not done properly. The front of the coat was uneven I would come to later find out it was a whole 1/2 inch off. Also at the bottom of both the right and left sides of the coat there was a zigzag stitch that shouldnt have been there it should have been a straight stitch. The sleeves also looked as if there was too much lining fabric where it joins the exterior of the coat. From the backside of the coat at the bottom the lining was visible (hanging down too far). When I questioned the employee she said her seamstress was gone for the day and to just leave the coat there so she could fix it.  When I returned 2 weeks later to pick up the coat there were no changes made to the coat at all. When I questioned the owner about why the seamstress put a zigzag stitch on the two bottom sides she said that was the only way it could be done to close the coat. I asked why the seamstress didnt go in from inside the lining and she said That would have been too much work. When questioned why it was still uneven she said it was because it was on the hanger and that once I put the coat on it would be fine. I explained to her that that wasnt the way it was when I originally purchased the coat that the coat was nice and even at the bottom. She insisted I put the coat on I told her it wasnt my coat and it wouldnt fit me because the coat belonged to my daughter who was away at college by this time.  By this time I just wanted to take my coat somewhere else to have it fixed but she was insistent on having the seamstress do repairs right then while I waited. I told her no that the coat had already been left there for them to fix and they failed to do anything to fix it in the three weeks since it was originally promised to me. I simply wanted my coat and I expressed that I wasnt going to pay for it because the job wasnt done properly and she grabbed my coat. I then pulled out my cell phone to call the police so that I could get my merchandise back and she proceeded to charge me for the work done even though it was very clear that I was not satisfied and I was neither confident nor comfortable with leaving my coat any longer. The owner proceeded to tell me to never bring anything to her again and I promised her I wouldnt.  Its been several weeks but Ive since had this coat fixed by FIT ALTERATIONS they did a phenomenal job! I would advise to NEVER take anything to TONYS CLEANERS AND TAILORS FOR ALTERATIONS. I really dont think the seamstress knows what shes doing.',1
'I like the place when I go out with my friends. The food is excellent. The staff is nice but a bit slow. Overall I would recommend.',5
'Its OK nothing special better than some other mom and pop places to eat. I would like to see more variety of food. I think Panda Express is a better quality however if you want quick nearby 51st Ave location then I would prefer this based soley on location.',2
'I love Sallys with all of my heart I am however terrified of any Sallys in Central Phoenix... That is of course until I discovered this Sallys on Camelback Rd. There are actually items IN STOCK at this location! I no longer dread the man hunt that usually goes down when I am having a hair dying relapse. This location is never crowded to the point where I feel my death is near by me being smothered into a fully stocked shelf of creme developers.  Overall give it a rest people. It is hard to beat Sallys. Professional items over crappy wannabe items at your local CVS. So you hate the service? Go down to Walmart and get a boxed DIY kit of anything and watch your head go bald. Sallys is not for ametures. You go in get what you need and off to business.  I have been a Sallys groupie for about 12 years and some of the best beauty products I have ever tried come from this store. The prices are also very low for the professional quality they are! Unbelievable!  If you want someone to hold your hand and coax you into buying a 200 flat iron then go to your local kiosk and the mall and get suckered for an extra 150 dollars over Sallys. Overall this location rocks! Go Sallys!  For. Eveeer(Sandlot voice) :-)',4
'Best Feature: Bento  Fujiya is noticeably different from most Japanese establishments in Arizona in that its owned and run completely by Japanese.  As such they run the place like a real conbini in Japan.  As you enter all of the workers great you with an Irraishaimase and you can peruse the isles filled with certain things you cant find in the Japanese section of LeeLee (Like Gabunomi and Qoo).  The place reminds me of the Nijiya chain in CA.  The Bentos are pretty much the best in the area.  A welcome addition to the neighborhood.',5
'Finally tried this place based on the reviews here.  I dont know if we went on a off day or what but I was not impressed.  Service was good very friendly however the food is another matter.  I have had alot of bbq in my time.  I am from Ohio and have eaten my fair share this was not even close to fresh homemade bbq.  My husband and I decided to both get the smoked chicken sandwich a side of fries mashed potatoes and gravy and a slice of red velvet cake.  When she handed us our sandwiches she said Take some extra sauce the sandwiches are usually dry extra sauce is fine I slathered it on but I found it strange that she put down the food right away.  It was dry and served on the most generic bun.  The sauce made up for it I poured it on and it was good.  The best bbq chicken sandwich? I think not.  The fries were inedible.  They were gross and soggy.  The mashed potatoes were ok.  I had to scrape the gravy off the top because it was a salty nastiness and eat them plain.  I love gravy I swear I think this is the first time in my life that I have not liked a gravy!  The red velvet cake was a huge disappointment.  I had envisioned something homemade and yummy.  Frankly it looked gross in the plastic container she handed me.  It was all smashed up and there was whipped cream all over the container.  Not good.....  Based on my experience here I would not go back.  I find it hard to believe that this is talked of as the best bbq in Phoenix.  I have had better bbq at chain restaurants.',1
'Last summer I bought a pair of goggles and before Id even worn them I foolishly left them in the car and they melted.  These guys let me exchange them which I thought was very nice of them.  Since then Ive used them for all my pool-related needs.  Dont forget - if you buy goggles dont leave them in the hot car!',5
'Rubios is ok when I want a chill place to relax while Im having lunch either on the patio (if you dont mind the noise from the road) or in the dinning room.  The fish tacos are in a heavy batter and are decent. I also enjoy the chicken burrito. I do think the pricing is a skosh high considering this is more like a fast food place.',3
'I sign up the account for writing this restaurant since I live nearby. With those negative reviews I still give it a shot. I found the food here wasnt as bad as I imagine its just like other Thai restaurant even more they are generous in food portion. Clearly the business was affected by the negative reviews here  but you should try yourself and you will understand sometimes you cant trust other peoples opinions.   I had pa nang curry its taste was what I expect. I would like to try every dish on the menu.  By the way now they share the seats with Saigon pho Im not sure if the owner were the same person but who cares? The food here is good.',4
'Wine on tap? I think thats an automatic 5 stars. Went to EVO for a mid-week happy hour and was not in the least disappointed. We sat at the bar for drinks and snacks and could not have been more content with the experience.  The happy hour menu is slightly short on the edible choices for a vegetarian but they happily made the arancini with marinara instead of meat sauce and were totally cool with splitting a pizza half meat/half veg. Our bartender was so sweet and accommodating we even got 2 rounds of pretty addicting ciabatta and olive oil as we wrapped up our second glass of beverages. I love that the red wine is served lightly chilled just the way I like it!  Though in a rather inconspicuous location that has been somewhat of a revolving door for restaurants in the past year or so I truly hope EVO breaks the streak and stays for good. The low-lighting speakeasy atmosphere is romantic and laid back at the same time. The crowd is energizing without being invasive. And being only 2 miles away I hope to become more of a regular before EVO becomes too trendy in Old Town :)',5
'DO NOT USE THIS CLINIC!!!  If ever there was a vet clinic that takes advantage of your situation this is the place.  Their charges are totally outrageous. They will perform every possible test/procedure they can think of and just pile on the costs all the while knowing that you are freaking out because your pet is sick or injured and that you will accept anything just to try and get them healthy.  Talk about upselling and piling on.  A 20 minute consultation cost $350 while administering some minor saline and oxygen and the total cost for this 20 minutes was over $650.....which after the 20 minutes they advised me to put my dog to sleep.  I accepted the recommendation but for them to do all of this in just 20 minutes only to tell me the dog needed to be put down was outrageous.  In that short period of time they jammed in every procedure they could then said put him down.  This is all about money for them and they are very very aggressive about getting paid.  I was harassed within 1 week of losing my dog by their billing people/receptionist and when I complained about the high charges for the short amount of time they saw my dog she actually had the audacity to tell me that I had received a substantial DISCOUNT and I should be glad that the doctor hadnt charged me- I SHOULD BE HAPPY!!.  I used the clinic in North Scottsdale on Scottsdale Road but I am sure they all have the same marching orders since they are corporate owned  Scottsdale Veterinary clinic is a much better place--http://scottsdaleveterinary.reachlocal.com/?scid=1621143&kw=10786567&pub_cr_id=26944826793- and they are open 24/7 but not considered an emergency (ripoff) clinic so they do not charge anything more for emergencies.',1
'Very cool place. Themed to the old west. The food was great. Wait staff were genuinely nice and in character. Live music was average but they take requests. Great place to take large groups a lot of open space. They had a private party area that included a game room with a cowboy themed pool table room.',5
'This years run I thought was better than previous years. The headliner concert was in the afternoon rather than later in the evening which made it easier for people to attend...from what I hear - I passed out after the run and missed the concert again.   The course is flat with minor hills in the back portion around mile 10. Despite flat and fast I always seem to run a little slower here than other courses. This year they presented a nice running tech shirt rather than the cotton ones in the past.  The shuttle service is great - but the past two years I have preferred to take the light rail. It is about a 1 mile walk from the light rail to the start but it is a nice warm up. This years 50K was cool and I find the expo is always nice. Big names with Dean Karnazes Ryan Hall and Deena Kastor. My company now has jumped in and started sponsoring us so I will continue to sign up. A good way to start off the year!',4
'Ive been waiting for this place to open for a while now. It seems many others were too with over 3000 likes on Facebook before their soft opening. Okay number one important item for a brewery is the BEER. Day one started with three very tasty beers (American Red Ale Estrella Pale Ale and an amazing session beer @ 3.7% ABV) on day two they added an excellent IPA. Yup this place is so good I went their two days in a row. And yeah I said an excellent session @ 3.7%. How they got this much flavor at this AVB Ive no clue. So BEERs = 4.9 stars and this is only the first batch. Not sure what to expect when they really get to know their brew system. 4.9 was only because their were no guest taps and with the limited handles they have they may never add (I dont know gonna have to ask) But their beers are so good I almost dont care.  Next for me is cleanliness this place is spotless granted it is new Boom 5.0 Stars. Service oh so many people fail here not these guys. Plenty of staff on hand to deal with the crowds 4.8 stars. Decor this place is ultra comfortable. I honestly thought with 3 bearded outdoorsmen opening a brewery it was going to look like the moose lodge or the Bass Pro Shop but no... elegant pictures surround you as you enjoy your beer in comfortable seating with soft lighting showcasing the gorgeous wilderness landscape photos. The colors scheme complements every aspect of the place and is easy on the eyes. A variety of seating arrangements and selection are available for patrons to enjoy. Ambience 5 stars and bonus .5 stars.  The food does not start until their grand opening on Sept 2nd 2013 and they already have many things staged including the menu and condiment baskets waiting to be filled. Ill update my review during the first week in Sept. CHEERS!',5
'I used to like Lola until I learned the owner is a sexist pig.  I will never visit again!',1
'Couldnt make it to my normal place so I had to try this spot and left very upset. First the people are very rude they barked at me to sit in one of the pedi chairs except it had no water in it and the tub was damp from the previous customer so I just sat there with my legs to the side for awhile until the girl who was going to do my pedi showed up. She was actually nice but was rather pushy in trying to up-sell me. The girl who did my mani was extremely rude and rough and was rushing through everything like she was on fire. She didnt even file or shape my nails instead she used that machine they use to shape acrylics. When I asked her to clean up my cuticles a little bit more she completely ignored me. At this point I was done and just wanted to finish and leave. I was going to tip the girls in cash and asked them to break my $20 the girl was again super rude and screamed at me asking how much I wanted back. I asked for two $5 and she brought me a $10. Whatever. Overall this place lacks professionalism and I will not be back.',1
'I came to Searsucker for the first time for a pre holiday dinner with the family. My eldest brother was a big fan of the location in San Diego and highly recommended it.  The place itself is very well laid out and the decor and lighting rendered itself as an old west theme mended with more modern architectural design. The theme of rope and wood paired with the old time style light bulbs were a nice combination that were complimented by lots of warm cove lights and well placed accent fixtures. Very relaxing.  One of the first things said was that they were known for their cocktails. Damn you mean to say I have to sample a bunch of drinks? Count me in! My gf and I had the Lieutenant Dan because well I sure as hell couldnt resist. Probably one of the most refreshing cocktails I have had in a while- not the strongest in the world but I think if they had loaded it up it wouldnt have been that refreshing. Both of my brothers order the Peter Rabbit- served in a copper cup. The two that were ordered looked a little different. When they noticed they decided to swap and compare the tastes- they were also a bit different. When we told the waiter he explained that all depending on the pour they can appear different but will often taste the same. When we said they also tasted different he apologized and bought us a round without batting an eye. We told him he didnt have to do that but he insisted and quickly got us another round on the house. For those who are wondering about the customer service- um....yeah. Either way Im not usually a cocktail guy but if youre stopping in here it is certainly going to be a treat to yourself to try some. They wont get you all crunk- but you just may be pleasantly surprised.  The food is one of my favorite styles- American classic. Minimal but hearty plates that you can easily share with others at the table. We began with some starters- I HAD to order the Pork Belly as its one of my favorite cuts but we also ordered the duck fat fries. The pork belly was some the best I have ever had. It was simple and all the flavors stood out very nicely. The duck fat fries- well if youve ever had duck fat fries you already know where Im going with this but all I will say is if you come here: order these! You will not be disappointed. Entrees- my brother and I decided to share the Duck x 3 and the Tongue and Cheek. Some of the best and most unique cuts of meat- delicious and I highly recommend. My gf decided to get two starters for her entree: the Farm Bird Lollipops and a chicken and waffle dish that I dont see on the online menu. I only tried the lollipops which were good- but I would suggest getting them as an appetizer (the pork belly and duck beforehand didnt exactly give them their due). All around the food is delicious. Although some of it may seem adventurous I highly recommend trying something new here if you havent had it. I think youll find something you really like.  Overall this place is great. The cocktails food and ambiance are top notch. You will notice the four dollar signs on the Yelp profile- a few extra dollars will be spend here. All depending on your budget I may not suggest Searsucker for a casual meal. However if youre looking for a special occasion kind of place or your budget just doesnt matter (I envy you if thats the case) Searsucker will act as a great solution if youre in the Scottsdale area.  Cheers.',5
'Doctor Suykerbuyk provided absolutely top-notch care for my daughter who needed surgery including a plate and screws.  We had no insurance and Dr. Suykerbuyk and his office not only gave us fair pricing but negotiated on our behalf with the anesthesiologist and the surgery center!  Dr. Suykerbuyk has a wonderful friendly bedside manner and put us at ease right away.  Dr. S. is also extremely confident and with good reason.  Our daughter healed faster that predicted and now has 100% use of her ankle.  The appointments were made quickly the office advised us promptly of any changes and we never waited more than 5 minutes to see Dr. S. on follow-up visits. Very professional all-around.  Other practitioners would be smart to follow Metro Foot & Ankles lead with regards to care pricing professionally-run offices/billing and bedside manner!',5
'This is a small mom-and-pop place across from the ASU West campus that caters to a mix of students locals and the small number of Asians in the Phoenix area.  Ive only been there a couple of times during lunch for the popular Vietnamese subs (banh mi).  The combination pork roll is a baguette made up of thinly sliced pickled carrots daikon onions cilantro and meat or tofu. Popular bánh mì fillings include pork paté and chicken.   The subs were pretty good but you cant complain as they are less than $4.  Also the pho looked good and I will definitely return to try another time.',4
'I love the pizza but there is always atleast a 45min wait for a table. But I have learned that you can pre-order your pizza so it will be ready close to the time you get seated. But their salads and deep dish is really good.',3
'Best guacamole in town. Great prices cool place to go with friends. Love it here. Fun to eat here while swimming as well.',5
'I am so surprised no one has rated this place. Pastor Lees messages always have a profound relevancy to life and the current issues my husband and I are facing. We moved away from Arizona over 4 years ago yet I still miss this church tremendously. (I did recently discover the ability to listen to the sermons online... thank you Radiant!) Oh and it certainly can be said we laugh always with the light spirit in which Pastor Lee conveys the word! He is funny and up-to-date with technology and the times. So very grateful for that!  God bless the Radiant pastors and community!',5
'Came in here on Parada del Sol to grab a quick bite. They were fairly busy but we were seated immediately. Nice atmosphere and the staff all seem very helpful to eachother. Almost like theyve all been part of this team for a long time. Terence was our server and was just fantastic. He knows the menu very well and his suggestions were spot on. I had the spaghetti and meatballs sister had Chilean sea bass with spinach ravioli and friend had chicken piccata. All of it fabulous. The bread and butter were awesome too. The salad dressings are so freaking good. I got house italian with blue cheese. Yumtown! The salad was freshcold and came with marinated onions of some sort. We all just loved it. The owner came over and said hi and really made us feel like we were regulars.....and Im thinking we just might be.',4
'I have been coming to this and all of their locations since they opened. The food is always fresh hot made to order and tastes very much like a homemade food. Whats that this is a weird very helpful and friendly. All of the girls that work here are very pretty. Great place for chicago thin and stuffed crust pizzas.',5
'The odds are that if youre a yelper and youve motored up Hayden Rd. in Scottsdale and passed Harpers Nursery youve noticed the L.E.D. powered open sign shaped like a coffee cup hanging in the window...  It took me a few weeks to get down there and investigate but one day I decided to give it a shot as I had some busy work to get done and I wanted to go somewhere besides Jamaican Blue or Orange Table - my  usual stops.  What I discovered was Oscars Coffee Bar.  Tucked in near the entrance to Scottsdales last family-owned and operated nursery one will find a java joint like no other in the valley.  While it might not be the sort of place you want to meet a snooty high profile client or present a portfolio it is absolutely the sort of place to go when you want to sit down with a cup of expertly-roasted coffee in a garden-like setting that almost makes one feel like theyre on sabbatical in Central America.  Inside the coffee shop itself there is a fun assortment of musical instruments including a piano a few guitars as well as a small amplifier and microphone - in addition to gardening information galore.  Theres also a nice vintage Pioneer stereo thats usually playing something good.  All in all its a great place.  The nursery itself feels more like a park than a place of business and there are nearly a dozen little benches chairs and the like sprinkled throughout the yard.  The staff is superb and its one of those places where everything is for sale - including the chairs you sit on and the tables you park your latte.  In conclusion support this business.  And if youre buying seeds plants or trees buy them at Harpers.  They wont die like the ones you buy at Lowes and Home Depot.  Why?  Because Harpers grows most everything they sell and its acclimated to the desert.  Theyll tell you how to plant what you buy and theyll make sure you have everything you need.  Theyll even put it in the ground for you if you so wish... for a fee.  Once again pleasantly surprised with this one...  Pay them a visit!  I mean where else in the valley can you sip a mocha and peruse a greenhouse at the same time?',5
'Thank you for treating me like a criminal.  Once upon a time I purchased a beautiful pair of Cole Haan boots from here.  OK it was two pairs but whos counting?  However when I tried to repeat that lucky find on another visit things went downhill fast.  After wandering through and finding nothing worth even trying on I headed out the door at the same time that a man (who I think works there) with a large box was coming in.  The security alarm went off but since I didnt touch/linger over/try on/purchase anything I paused briefly then just kept walking.  Mistake.  The woman behind the counter ran out of the store yelling you need to come back in here RIGHT NOW!.  Ummm... people are staring... I go back inside with her and she gives me a kind of up-down look and says she has to see the inside of my purse.  I cant hold it open and let her see she has to take it from me and paw through it on the counter.  Really?  You think I took something?  The outfit I am wearing (grown-up business clothes by the way) is fitted and does not have pockets and the purse (not one of my usual suitcase-sized bags) is very small.  Where exactly did she think I was hiding merchandise?  Did I somehow fit a pair of stilettos in my bra?  WTF!?  Finding nothing she proceeds to lecture me on the importance of removing the magnetic security tags from inside clothing since they set off her alarm.  Um I dont have any of those but gee thanks for the helpful information.  Hmmm... do you think maybe the guy coming in with the box set off your alarm and not me?    There are plenty of other places to feed my footwear habit without being completely embarrassed.',1
'This has become part of our regular rotation.  Egg drop soup always hits the spot.  Portions are large could easily be split between two people especially since the soup and the crab puffs are included.  Love the sauce with the crab puffs.  Service is always good.  Food is very good making it easy to look beyond the lackluster ambience.',4
'Saturday I knew where I wanted to go and what I wanted to feast on. Burgers baby! So I dialed up my posse (my dad and little brother) and hollad at them to meet me at the SanTan Brewery in Chandler around 1:30 pm. Finding the place was a little bit of a problem. They key is paying attention all while avoiding a car wreck; otherwise youll miss it once twice or three times like I did. For the record its south of Chandler Blvd and just west of Arizona Ave. The parking situation was a tad tight so we circled around a few times and found a spot nearby. We ended up parking upfront but further down the strip which was about 4-5 businesses down wind. At the very least the parking spot was in the same complex so that was a plus.   The moment we entered we were greeted with a complete view of their brewing tanks show cased behind glass windows. If I am not mistaken I think every seat in the house offers a decent view of them. The bar-side seating seemed like a preferred spot as every seat was filled. The place was packed as far as indoor seating goes so we opted for outdoor seating. This time of year the weather is great so outdoor seating is just plain awesome. It did take about 15 minutes before we were seated so it wasnt a very long wait. The hostess (who was very bubbly from the getgo) walked us over to our patio seats and like always we began to play musical chairs because of the draft. Since the sun did not rest upon us directly it was a bit breezy for those who have a tendency to be cold I wont mention names. If it gets to cold for comfort they have those nice outdoor heaters to warm you right up.  The SanTan Brewery is a very inviting place I enjoyed it quite a bit. The layout didnt feel or come off like a typical sports bar if you know what I mean. I am not a sports buff so sports on TV is simply wasted on me. Yeah there may have been flat-screens tuned into sports channels but the impression definitely revolved around its intention and that is the beer. It is definitely a cool place to hang out and matter of fact I am seriously considering making it one of my favorite watering holes even though I am not a big drinker. Its just that cool. The minute you walk in you are immediately sucked in and are overtaken by urges to sample everything they have to offer. So in order to quench your sudsy curiosity I recommend trying their SanTan Beer Sampler which will run you $8. Get yourself an idea of what you fancy before diving straight in. Unless you are a beer connoisseur or an aficionado then by all means dive away.   The service was a bit on the slow side for my taste but our waiter (Oscarito is what they call him) was way cool and very helpful. Family tip: If you are thinking about bringing the smaller family members keep in mind that the bathrooms dont come equipped with changing stations.  I was cognizant of what I wanted the minute I decided to go to the SanTan Brewery because I reviewed their online menu before hand. Preparation is key! So without delay I ordered the Stuffed Kasbah Burger. The name alone immediately sent me back to the 80s: The Clash Rock The Casbah. Needless to say that was playing in my mind most of the night. Something dont like it. Rockin the Casbah! Rock the Casbah! However this version of the Kasbah is made with ground LAMB and it comes stuffed with chopped dates pistachios smoked Gouda and topped with Moroccan Aioli [eye-oh-lee] sauce (sounds intriguing right). As a side dish I was able to choose from: pub fries Caesar or pub salad or the homemade soup of the day which was Chipotle Bean Soup. I of course opted for the fries because I love fries and they make me want to break out in a ballad. Like: I love the fries the fries love me they taste so good so yummy yummy yummy... now get in my belly.  It took quite a while for our order to arrive but at first sight I thought it was covered with what appeared to be a spicy yellow mustard substance and instantly I asked the waiter with a perplexed look on my face what is this yellow stuff. Moroccan Aioli sauce he simply explained. At this point I was a little beyond buzzing (empty stomach) and thought to myself oh yeah thats right I did read that somewhere. So I proceeded as always and piled on the red onions lettuce the single slice of tomato and finished off with the bun. The first bite made me think of Indian or Burmese curry. It was like I was eating a curry burger. Seriously a curry burger. I am fan of curry so to me this was good but there was something missing. I cannot put my finger on it. Perhaps a spice or ingredient but something was off. Needless to say this is one of those items that wont be a hit with everyone. I did enjoy it and the fries though were awesome crispy and full of flavor.   I liked the burger the concept the use of lamb but something was missing from the Moroccan Aioli sauce. Anyhow I did dig the curry like flavor and experience of the burger. Would order it again!',4
'This is my favorite pizza joint in AZ. I come here all the time and the service and food are always consistently great. At this point they even know what I want when they see me haha. I take everyone here and Id recommend that everyone try Stumpys!',5
'The chef was from a big local authentic Chinese restaurant.  If you order the Americanized Chinese dishes it doesnt taste that great. However if you order the authentic Chinese dishes they are great since the quality is better and it requires more skills to prepare and cook.   Unfortunately some of those dishes are on their secret menu which is a hand written note attached to the wall.  You can also order special stuff too if you know what to order.  Good luck! :)',4
'We used our discount coupon that we bought at Homerun.com to try Bombay Spice Grill.  It was wonderful! Food was delicious reasonably priced and healthy. The service was great...very friendly.  It was a great experience and we will definitely go back there.',4
'Had lunch there this past Friday.  The service was slow for how few people were there but I dug the atmosphere and LOVED the music on the jukebox.  Now for the food.  I had the pulled pork w/ cole slaw and a side of mac n cheese.  The first thing I do at ANY bbq place is try and taste the meat all by itself which wasnt hard to do at Earls - because they didnt drown the sandwich in bbq sauce like a lot of places do.  What I tasted was some of the best flavored pork since I went to Sonny Bryans in Texas. Im sure there was some salt and pepper rubbed on the hunk o pork before they stuck it in the smoker which is really all good bbq needs.  Any REAL bbq afficionado knows that the more crap (i.e. seasonings) on a piece of meat the more the bbq-er is tryin to hide.  So I didnt taste brown sugar garlic thyme paprika chili powder lemon apple and God knows what else but I DID taste well smoked pork.  As God intended.  Thank you Big Earls!  I tried both the regular and the sweet n spicy sauces which were disappointing.  They just bored me.    The slaw was crisp and lightly dressed (in other words it wasnt goopy).  The mac n cheese was simple and perfect.',4
'First time I played bingo at in Arizona. I like how the smoking and non smoking rooms are separated they have a casino shuttle and there is a Radisson hotel next door. The bad part of the casino are the location is very far out in no where and the food service and food for the bingo players is okay.',3
'Being a huge pizza junkie I had been waiting to go here for months especially after reading the reviews. But with their crap hours its nealy impossible to on a day you can at least that was my experience. Anywho! Their service was very good their drinks were good  and the pizza took like 10 minutes to come out! However their pizza was definitely nothing to RAVE about. It was good but not as good as I had hoped. Id go here again since its close to my house. But id pick Biancos or Cibo or parlor over this place any day.',3
'How often do you find a restaurant that provides service comparable to the finest restaurant in town prices that are surprisingly reasonable a fun but intimate ambience and food that is creatively prepared and a joy to eat? Becketts Table has struck just the right chord and each time weve been there we left happy happy happy.  A  lot of their dishes are prepared with bacon and other delectable but not so healthy ingredients and eating health consciously in a restaurant can often be a drag leaving one wanting. Not this last visit. The sea bass was prepared beautifully and was perfectly satisfying. I did take a bite of the biscuits and they were heavenly. But a bite was all I needed. Especially since I ordered a side of spinach spaetzle which is the best way yet to eat your veggies. The only problem we encountered was parking. A little guidance would have been helpful as we drove up to a very small and very full lot. In a sheer stroke of luck someone was leaving as we arrived and we got the one open spot. Pity the party that arrived just after us.',4
'Fundido is amazing but prices seem to go up and up. I honestly. An not bring myself to pay almost 20.00 for one any more. Luna does have great coupons like buy one entree get one free though so hubbys and I will get fundidos and I dont feel so guilty. I worked at luna in high school and I have no problem eating there ;) other places such as pei Wei and quiznos I wil never eat in again lol!',3
'I think Daren C. and I have the same taste buds! Now that I have mine back that is.... long story.   I went to have my dogs groomed in the area and the owner of the kennel said this joint has a great breakfast.  So I love to eat and I had an hour to kill so 40th street here I come. He was right this joint has a pretty tasty Bfast. I had this skillet with Eggs Chorizo onions peppers and potatoes. It was huge! It was nummy nu mmy in my tummy. The best part is.......wait for it.........they had my favorite coffee ever! Farmer Brothers! I am not a coffee drinker and dont claim to be but I will drink a pot of that Farmer Brothers it is so good! Warning do not order the sausage gravy it is not real gravy and they just toss sausage in it YUCK! Besides the gravy and one annoying waitress. This joint is cool with me. I took one star away because they need to clean a little better. All and all good food good price good portions and a good start to my day! Thanks',4
'I love this place.  Been there three times and have never been disappointed.  The servers are super-friendly almost to the point of medicinally-induced happiness but works for me.  I always get the same pasta dish so Im not sure what else to order.  It is pricier than Im used to spending but good for an ocassional treat.   I love the little patio areas outside and the live music on weekend nights.  An out-of-the-way joint with good food good atmosphere and good services without the Scottsdale attitude.',4
'Went here with a few friends on a Saturday night and it was pretty awesome. They werent as crowded as I had expected though there was a decent amount of people.   Our waiter was super nice helpful and attentive. They have a nice selection of beer and my friends enjoyed everything they ordered. I had Rum and Diet which was of course delicious and on special!  We had fried pickles quesadillas boneless wings and something else. Their menu on the website doesnt work so I cant go refresh my memory. We had the BBQ and Garlic boneless wings and while they didnt look particularly appetizing they were delicious. The fried pickles were a little spicy for me but Im a baby when it comes to spicy foods lol. My friend loved his quesadilla.   The only downside is that their barstools are very uncomfortable after a few hours. I would recommend sitting in the regular seating section if youre planning on staying a while.   All in all this place was great and well definitely be back!',5
'I really like this place.  It is spacious and the building is really cool.  I liked that it was modern and clean.  They even have flat screen t.v.s above the urinals in the mens room.  It was easy for me to find a parking spot which is always a plus.  I like going here to watch a game for happy hour or to meet a friend for a drink.  The customer service has always been great.',4
'Huge portions! One regular order lasts me three meals.  Ill be coming back here to fulfill my bbq cravings.',4
'What is that smell?!? Just walked in had to leave to throw up... Didnt make it past the hostess stand :/',1
'Cheuvront is a perfect date night place. My cute guy set up a reservation for a Thursday night out. We arrived a little early after he realized Cheuvront would close at 2100. We wanted to be sure to he our cheese and wine fix to the maximum. I was impressed at the extensive cheese list. I lived in France for two years & this compares very well to a fromagerie in France with all the different cheeses. The staff is all quite nice and knowledgable on the menu of cheeses and wines to pair with. We selected three cheeses and asked to pair with the suggested wines. I was very impressed. The cheese plate is paired with fruits and a scatter of almonds to cleanse the palate between cheeses. My boyfriend ordered the risotto for his entree and he was asked if he wanted salmon or chicken ... It wasnt a small amount of salmon as one would expect  but a quite moderate piece of salmon filet. I had the Cheuvront chicken served with polenta. Rarely do I finish my entire entree  but this meal was heaven in my mouth. For dessert we shared a piece of hazelnut torte and champagne. Perfect date night and worth the extra workout. The staff is wonderful and the ambience is romantic. The only two things would change is a later closing ...& not to serve dinner while the cheese course is being savoured. But because the meal and experience of Thursday night date night was so amazing ... Still earns a 5 ...& my date spot on is a 10 for making this such a great night :)',5
'Tried Humble Pie because of the groupon and was excited when I saw the menu online. Walked in and we got a table that must have been the most wobbly table I have ever seen in a restaurant. I felt I could live with it so our server brought our drinks. Looked at the priced in the menu and they seemed kinda pricey for what I wanted so I went with the half chopped salad. It took a while to get our food. While people that ordered after us were receiving their food. Finally our food came out and it tasted good so that is why they get three stars. The problem was the service. It took long also to receive the bill and to have the server pick up and run the card.',3
'This is good clean fun.  The best part to my story was I was willing to lose all my chips just to get to the bathroom and I just kept doubling up on the tables.  Thanks!',3
'Ive been going to this carwash for a few years now. Its a bit hard to spot out unless youre looking for it. I was referred by a local since I only work in Scottsdale.   Consistently good service done quickly and always super affordable. When my girl needs a quick rinse they have a $4.99 wash/blow dry. A full service wash/vacuum/hand dry is about $15 with all the little extras (i.e. air freshener tire shine etc.).   Everyone is super friendly as well.',5
'Home Sweet Home.',4
'Behold and Beware The Power of Mexican Chiles in Action  That was the theme of our first time here. MH ordered the Steak Tampico marked as a 3 pepper dish. Seeing what followed with him was entirely new to me. If you can see a brown person turn red you know its hot.   His take: among the spiciest things Ive ever eaten better than sinus medication if you have a cold. Hotter than the most diabolical chicken wings that we had together and needed 2 full pitchers of water with. Evidently the chiles in the red sauce which covered the bottom of the plate spread into the guacamole the lettuce the tomato the olive ...  The white sauce on top performed the same function for the steak ...   Although he finished about half which is usual. I wonder how long the effect will last and am monitoring the situation ...   Our server was friendly and attentive. The chips and salsas were filling. My chicken ? dish was fine. Didnt see why sour cream is an (expensive) extra. The flour tortillas on the side were ok but bland. Nothing to compare with El Sol. The plates were cute as they had the name of the restaurant  handwritten and fired into the various bright colors ...   The menu had photos a little blurry but nice touch. Maybe its just me but Im not really fond of burritos and chimichangas swimming in sauce. Not that I got either this time but if I do a special request would definitely be in order.   Overall I dont think the quality of the food is worth the price. ok but ordinary. I may go again being married to a hot food junkie but who knows - the effects of this particular mouth-burning may go deeper than I think. Time will tell ...   off to give him an acid pill :-)',2
'Horrible customer service. The waitress was very indifferent and could care less about serving us though they were not very busy. Had to flag her down to order. The food did come quickly but then I had to flag her down to for the check and then finally to pay. Craziness!  The food was so-so. The coconut milk soup was too strong and the spicy basil leaf wasnt very good either. The Pa-nang was good.',1
'Service was great Waitress was Brittainey. Price for happy hours was crazy good. Much prefer a non-imitation crab option but the atmosphere was fun and overall the meal was very enjoyable.',4
'Ive lived here 7 years and always see the parking lot full I figured Id give it a try. Wenton a Friday night around 6 pm...the staff was really nice and attentive- hence the 2 stars. As for the food small selection first of all second...I got one plate full took one bite...cold... another bite.....squishy....and the chicken (it was supposed to be chicken) was horrible. Sometimes I just dislike different sauces but the actual Meat tasted awful- like it was bad. Maybe it was just a bad night but either way it was the grossest food Ive ever had. On the plus side I asked the manager for our money back since neither of us could even begin to finish ONE plate and were hating it and she refunded the money without question.',2
'Make sure you get the warm carrot cake if you go to J. Alexanders.  The service is always friendly the parking is a bit of a challenge at times but the food is always consistant.',3
'Im not a huge pizza fanatic but this location was my go to on pizza nights. I was sad to drive by and see they were replaced by a sub shop! :-(',5
'Im a previous Safeway only shopper this store has changed that. Terrible lines unhappy cashiers who dont enjoy their job and openly complain about their coworkers & their schedules & treat customers like an inconvenience. Its not one or two there has to be a leadership problem for the difference to be so noticeable between this one and every other Safeway Ive shopped. I have gotten good service at the produce and meat departments and the team at Starbucks are great - happy & helpful!',2
'Okay so Im writing a review for Pizzeria Bianco what can I say that hasnt already been said? First things first the owner. Chris Bianco is a great man with excellent taste. Second the restaurant. Small intimate cozy & damn it if you dont feel special just eating there in the dim lighting of a warm fire. Third the food. The simplicity of the menu allows us to center in on the food & not be drowned under 5 pages of fluff like other restaurants. The focus on only a few items that are made to enjoy & not just fill you up is how things should be done. Why have 100 choices if they all fall under the radar. Mae West said Between two evils I generally like to pick the one I never tried before. When your done having to choose between several food evils at other places come down to Pizzeria Bianco and try a slice of heaven. The pizza is great Im not going to paint you a Monet like description. Come down buy a pie find out for yourself. Read a review then try the food & make up your own mind.',5
'I was underwhelmed by my experience at The Vig Fillmore. It might have been that we were seated inside instead of on the awesome patio. It might have been that the menu is one of the worst I have seen (Pad Thai and Burgers? Mexican food and Edamame?). It might be their apparent love affair with American cheese or as I call it plastic. (Why not use cheddar?) Sorry to say it but based on their current menu I most likely will not return. I wish them all the best and hope they create a better menu.',3
'I went to this place for my 21st birthday because I heard about it being a cool bar on yelp.  I find that this place lives up to the reviews.  It is a hipster place but they have created a clean and intimate space that is nice for small groups or a date not anyone more than I would say 8 unless it is a slow night.  I will return when I am in the neighborhood.',4
'Where do I begin. Was in Scottsdale on biz and celebrated Valentines Day with another couple. The scallops were just right. The Chop Salad is the best in the nation possible exception the 1905 at Tampas venerable Columbia. We split Sea Bass & a petite filet. I love the butter they cook the steak in. Asparagus & sweet potatoes along side. 4 forks to the Chocolate Sin Cake. Ask for Stu or Stacia Cost? If you have to ask........',5
'Awesomeness! So smart but Its a bit confusing for a fist timer. Them muffins are great wish they put more sandwiches and breakfasts on them. The place is so rules free I hope people do not take advantage because they give the customer the benefit of the doubt.     Pizza was nice love to have tried the sweets but as it was January I was already way over my careful calorie count. The rockin tunes added so much though I am sure the format appeals to mostly a younger crowd.     Some Details Counter Service until 4. Pizza day time only weekends. Sandwiches are picked up at a different counter than pizza and burgers. There is a white bucket for your dishes.',5
'Got the Large pizza (delivered)  had good flavor and seemed to be quality ingredients however the grease level was on the excessive side.  Ill probably go back and try the subs',3
'Delicious local fare.  They have a working garden out back for all you nature lovers to help minimize your carbon footprint.  Seriously if you want to go out for a picnic with some really good food and not hassle with packing the basket this is your place to kick back and relax.',5
'Thanks for being on happy cow app! Love finding new places for healthy eating :)',5
'Although I have not done it nearly enough since moving here I do LOVE to hike!  I read about these trails through my friends here on YELP and thought I should check them out!  I hit a trail and found myself winding up and down several smaller mountains overlooking several Arrowhead subdivisions with a beautiful view of the area.  This is not a hardcore hike but still a really nice afternoon or morning activity.  The trails were very quiet and for the most part were well marked.  The entire trail is a bit over 4 miles and is a pretty descent working!  Unlike some larger hikes I have been on most of this trail could easily be run if you are interested in a good ass whipping!  Go check it out!  People were all friendly parking was a breeze and it really gives you a nice view of the West Valley and beyond!',4
'We are regulars at this location and most of the staff recognizes us. Its nice to enter and see someone smiling back at you ready to happily take your order!  I order the fish taco plate most of the time. I did try the portobello mushroom tacos. They were good for a vegetarian option.  The kids enjoy the chips salsa rice beans a guacamole. All of these things you can get as sides in small portions.  Thanks for providing a qualitykid friendly and relaxed  lunch spot! See you next week!',4
'We love Angel Sweet. Heres why:  1. Theres always plenty of parking. 2. The kids working there are nice. 3. They have the BEST PEANUT BUTTER GELATO I have ever eaten.  4. They dont limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size like some other places do.  So go ahead try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with Angel Sweet. Just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.',5
'I was craving a gyro and while my pregnant daughter opted for a chicken wing spot (to go) nearby the rest of us enjoyed a quick dinner at Phoenicia Grill.   It was ok.  I like alot of things in my gyro salad.  While plenty green it was it lacked the speckles of other vegetables I enjoy in a salad.   The dressing was ok.  Having checked in via Yelp gave us a 10% discount on the bill so that was a plus!  I may be back since I know of no other gyro place in the area!  :)',3
'Of course I would give Sephora 5 stars and even more for this location. Like the other reviewers have mentioned this Sephora is a lot better than the one in the Scottsdale mall. Employees are great here very knowledgeable and eager to help. I like the fact that they are able to give me ideas for the products that I am going to buy in addition to letting me know about other products.   While theres a JCP being constructed near our house with a Sephora inside its obviously not going to be as good or stocked as the one in the mall (besides the points arent added).',5
'Great happy hour until 10:00pm every night!  Amazing sushi specials and great service!',5
'Ohh I wish there was a different hardware store in Maricopa.  The most annoying part of this Ace Hardware is how they ask you every 2 minutes if you need help.  Annoying if you have already told several of them NO and in most cases the same person several time.   Most people either know what they are looking for or have the common sense to ask.  If im not in a rush ill drive into town as opposed to go here.  Most items are overpriced compared to home depot or lowes',2
'Olive& Ivy is great! They have a restaurant and a marketplace both of which offer tons of great food and drinks. This place is perfect for a date or a luncheon with some friends. Their bacon-wrapped dates...holy balls talk about memorable. If you get lucky and the patio is open sit outside for a completely different experience from what youll get inside. Their patio furniture is adorable and sits on the water. Inside the vibe is very trendy and upscale while still remaining relatively casual.   Overall O&I is a great place to hit up after a long day at the mall whether you want to sit down or grab-and-go.',4
'Southwest has been my go to for flying any ware. I just have one issue  give us some more roasted peanuts!!!  ^_^   -Cheers-.',3
'In addition to Cheuvront another reason to take the lightrail on Central.  The pizzas here are fairly close to what I enjoyed in Rome.  Wine selection is good and the martinis are well-made.  Service is sometimes not as snappy as it could be but never rude or cold in my experience.',4
'I have been here many times before in the last 10 years but I think it is going downhill.  The service is top notch and the grounds are pretty nice. When you look at the rooms 4 stars and spa 3 * it is just better than average.  The remodeled rooms are pretty decent  but the spa needs some updating.  The same chairs have been in the mediation room for over 10 years and the lockers and shower areas have seen better days.  A matter of fact someone stole my sandals in the locker room.  This place is getting ghetto.   If I am going to pay this much I think I will check out the Westin  Kierland or some of the many other resorts.  It is a nice place and the service can be accomadating but there are some problems that keep it from getting 4-5 stars.',3
'My uncle has been telling me for years that his picture hangs right next to Ernie Banks. Naturally I told him he was full of crap. So when my other uncle flew down from San Francisco for spring training we decided to see if he was really telling the truth.   The chopped liver appetizer tray was really good considering Ive never had it nor was I even remotely interested by the sound of it.  I had a salad which was good (how can you really mess up a salad.)  Now I ordered the prime rib rare with fresh horseradish and a baked potato.  It was singlehandedly the best piece of red meat Ive ever eaten.  Cooked to perfection (as was my wifes and uncles steaks) just melted in my mouth like butter.  Ive been to Flemings the Keg and various other steakhouses and they dont come close to this.  The horseradish was incredibly fresh with a lot more kick to it than normal.  The service was excellent with a very friendly staff.  The manager was more than helpful in trying to help us locate the picture of my uncle and his baseball team from Chicago.  He narrowed down the area for us and after 3 minutes of searching low and behold there it was.  19 years later the picture is still there.  I will go back and not to visit the picture but for the great food that awaits me.',5
'Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 8 Food 8 Service 5 Atmosphere 7 Value  The stars seem disjointed from the scores.  Thats because if you eat here you will lose months off your life each time.  People that say it doesnt taste good cant get past the mental block of how greasy and unhealthy it is.  If you can its delicious.  But if you think about what youre eating too long even just the thoughts will make your left arm tingle.',2
'Been here twice and both times I have had amazing services and it is really timely. The people working totally are enjoying their jobs and you can tell it! I wish there were more of these located around the valley!',5
'My first time going.....  The waitress looked like she was ready to give birth as she took our drink order. I had stated I had never been there before but she still didnt give me the break down of how this whole grill thing worked. In her defense she appeared to be the only one working there   My kids loved it because their bowls were endless they were able to make and eat as much as they wanted and it was well priced for theirs.   The adult bowls on the other hand were not worth it. Very pricey for one bowl and wouldnt be worth it to spend almost $15 for an endless bowl.   The grill line wasnt as clean as I would have wanted but needless to say the kids that were in front of us knew how to pile on their items and just leave a mess behind.   The part of watching them grill I have to say I was impressed and my daughter were in aww to watch it happen also.   We had a 20% off coupon and the waitress never took it off the bill had to wait 15 minutes just to get our bill so I didnt want to wait any longer to have her deduct a few dollars.   The food tasted excellent. If they would lower their price and get some better staff I might frequent this one more often.',2
'Was here for 5 days on business didnt use the Casino. The place is great. Food Rooms and Service exceeded my expectations.',4
'Best burger in town best beet salad ever.  Fries to die for.  Banana split off the hook.  Groovy ambience for dinner casual chic for lunch.  My most recent trip took a business partner for lunch.  Wait was negligible at 12:30 and the staff was fantastically friendly and attentive.  Water refills are a luxury on a 95 degree day and they were on the ball.  They have a great drink menu including some fun beers that go well with the burgers.  I got the house lager this time which was crisp and clean for the toasty day.  Burger is to die for--I think its gruyere caramelized onions and a baguette.  Skipped the fries this time and got the beet salad--perfection with goat cheese and candied pecans.  Reasonably priced--$25 for Beer salad and burger.  Sweet!',5
'Every dish I have ever had here has been amazing.  Fragrant spicy full of flavor.  As stated before the service is excellent.  Ive tried about 10 dishes here and every time I thought to myself god damn this is good!.  They are also very knowledgeable about their food and their ingredients and can customize dishes to your dietary restrictions and/or guide you to a more appropriate dish.  Please be aware that they only serve their full ala carte menu at night during the day was buffet only and the last time we went they only had 2 dishes which were dairy-free so we had to bounce which was super disappointing because I was fiending their food.  Do yourself a favor if youre a fan of lemonade and try theirs its amazing.',5
'Too bad there is not an option for NO stars...Meeting clients for lunch my associate and I were seated in the back on the left in one of the middle booths. First red flag should have been that the back of the booth upholstered back and seat cushion had at least a 1 gap exposing the wood frame its built on. We both sit down on one side facing the back door. Waitress and trainee were very nice and got us water. After sitting for about 5 minutes something catches my eye I look down and in my lap is a COCKROACH!!!! I kid you not! I hit it out of my lap onto floor and managed not to scream which is a miracle. I immediately got up and told my associate and waitress quietly. Had to stay because we were meeting clients moved to front table to white knuckle it through this meeting! I will never ever go back.',1
'I have never had a bad experience here.  Yes you will wait at the week-end but the food is worth it.  cash only should not be a problem - they have an ATM inside.  No cell phones - makes a refreshing change - it is all like going back in time - including the decor.  Servers are great.  Food is fantastic - love their ham and eggs and chocolate chip pancakes - not had better anywhere else !',5
'Service was so slow and that is the only reason that its lacking a five star rating.  Food is absolutely amazing whether its take out or eat in. Such a romantic spot that my honey and I decided to eat in tonight and enjoy some time together. The service was really slow but assuming it was because they were under staffed and busy totally not a big deal; plus I was busy making googly eyes at the hot man beside me.  Order: Honey Chicken and Pad Prik King with Beef Both with Brown Rice  Food came out with white rice again no biggie; however we were done with the meal before it came out. Big bonus for them not charging us for rice. Food was absolutely incredible; honey chicken is down right lick the plate good and not even gonna lie I took some of the mans sauce to put on my rice. So delish!   Definately will be back again and again. Love love love!',4
'Actually they are back open about a mile West of where they were. Dont get the other review ratings wonder what they consider good. Hal O Penos has been around for quite some time and has been consistent (good ) the the entire time. Yes the new location has zero the ambiance of the old location strip mall throw in some tables and chairs.  My #2 is as good as ever.',4
'Their cheesesteak is a must try of you are ever in the area.   Nothing fancy about the sandwich just a good soft roll good cut of ribeye and the perfect amount of cheese.',4
'Great location on NW corner of 59th Ave. & Beardsley/101.  Convenient if youre coming southbound on 59th Ave. and need coffee before hopping on the 101 to get to work.  Its like all of the other chain locations of Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.  Same selection of beans reasonable prices and I like how they give you a complimentary cup of coffee & paper coffee filters with a purchase of beans.  Drip coffee is excellent among the best as far as coffee chains go.  They often have multiple coffees to choose from both dark roast and lighter roast.  Certainly better than Starbucks.  Barista prepared drinks arent so good.  Staff is mostly young kids who are polite as far as retail goes but not so skilled as baristas.  Ive noticed a high frequency of overheated milk in the lattes (you cant miss this on the taste side of things).  Theres always a few people here but Ive never seen it crowded except perhaps Friday and Saturday nights as the Sushi restaurant crowd spills over.  Located in a clean safe area.',3
'The Pad Kee Mao is awesome!',4
'dont be from out of town & leave anything in there worth anything!! i went with mom to kill time & had a detail which they did do a GREAT job!! BUT when i got home they put all my belonging from my vehicle in a trash bag in trunk w mats etc minus a NEW cologne i had on back of seat rest!! this was mon 6/11 i called em tues and they took my number & beat around the bush told me to call today!! well theyre offering me more services (which is cool but NOT my cologne & i DONT need any more services i obvisiously can pay for my own)  but not to pay for my cologne??? wtf really... they said theyre NOT responsible for items lol so if u want to get robbed go there... glad the thief left my rose gold watch i had in there worth $1k+ & just jacked my cologne!! so please be careful i used them before no problem but im not a negative dude but dont like being taken advantage of...  like id try to get a free cologne which a had jus bought a week ago!!!!!

'Awful. After all the batting away of the flies dodging the moldy chips straining to hear my date over the blaring and awful mexican music and noticing that my Sierra Mist was brown I never did get around to actually ordering a meal I was too frightened to! The walls were supposed to be white but you could only see it through all the dirt where the chair had recently scratched the wall.....wont be going back!   I suspect someone spends a lot of time writing their own reviews....',1
'I can Pho-give this place for decent service.  Granted my group of 8 was the only one around that quiet night.  My Pho was pretty good I think I finished before everyone around the table but I have a big mouth.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food or maybe it was just good company :)  I love the decor; felt like I walked into one of my old school relatives homes - tacky Asian art with a modern twist.  They have a small wine selection wow!  Never really gone into a Pho place with a plethora of wine!  Maybe next time I feel like eating Pho and talking about my failed relationships Ill be back ;-P enjoy!',3
'Carnitas bowl with the hot salsa is a hit with me ... For now this place has replaced Pita Jungle as my default weekend lunch spot.',4
'I always loving going to Postinos. Love the bruschetta. Use the valet parking or else youll have a heck of a time finding a parking spot. I',4
'My dog Riley offered to write this review but she doesnt have thumbs. Ill interpret her barks for you all.  Riley- bark bark baaaaaark woof. Translation- I love this park!   Riley- woof howwwwwwlllll woof bark. Translation- The dogs here are soooo nice!  Riley- bark ruff ruff woof. Translation- I love all the space to play and the water fountains. Theres even bushes for me to sit in the shade. Sometimes I like to hang out in the Active Dogs side when I want to run around and play and I can go to the Passive Dogs side when Im feeling mellow.   Dog speak is a complicated language.',4
'We went to Roys for a special occasion dinner and started at their Aloha Hour. For $5 each we got lobster pot stickers (3) Beef Skewers (3 single bites) with Kimchee Cucumber Salad. I had the 1988 with Grapefruit juice pomegranate and lychee...YUM. My husband had a Mai Tai and wasnt overly thrilled with it. It was all yellow and not overly tasty (just pineappley). We each ordered a glass of wine to take with us for dinner ($5 vs. $15 on the dinner menu...getting it there was much more cost-effective).   The staff was very friendly. They surprisingly got very busy all at once so there were some delays in service but we were in no rush so didnt mind. The seafood was very tasty. Portions are on the small side though. One item in my seafood sampler was not as it should have been (stuffed shrimp arrived empty!). The waiter asked the chef about it and tried to convince me it was really there but just on the outside which was irritating because it clearly wasnt. So the chef gave me a blob of stuffing on the side. A little odd but at least some effort was made to make it right.   The Chocolate souffle is certainly worth the $10.50 and 20 minute prep time. THE BEST.   If you want a little tropical getaway its a great place to go. Expect it to be a bit pricey (if not doing Aloha Hour) and portion sizes a little small but the tastes are very large and worth it and they do make special occasions special!',4
'My decided to go there in Friday night. The place was empty. We arrived at 830 and had to seat ourselves on the patio because the hostess was not there. The waitresses outside who kept looking our way didnt bring us over a menu or take our drink orders until 9. Finally we got to order our drinks which never showed up. Finally at 920 we decided to walk out. With the economy how it is and with the amount of traffic there one would think they would be starving for our business. That obviously wasnt the case.',1
'Excellent food great staff - its family run.  Good atmosphere.',5
'Food was terrific. Waitress was having a bad day or she might have just gotten the new Samsung note II because she did not remember it was a family friends birthday which I told her in the beginning and after the meal...  That aside  great place to eat!    Food 8/10 Service 5/10 Experience 5/10   -Cheers-.',2
'They tow customers cars! Seriously I got there at 8:45 pm to meet up with my cousin while he was in town had a couple of beers inside and then walked out at 10:30 to find that my car was missing. I had parked on the end of the other cars which was not a space so my first guess was that it had been towed.... Yup.  I found the phone number for the towing company on a sign on the wall of the establishment and called them. They had no record of having towed my car. Then I walked over to ask a bouncer and he confirmed that my car had been towed. I asked why and he said that it was because I was parked improperly. I responded but Im your customer and you guys went straight to towing?! He said that he felt bad about it but yes. Then he told me I could get the number for the towing company from the other bouncer. I called the number he gave me and a young woman answered with a simple hello. Uhhh is this a towing company?  She responded that she worked for a towing company. Okay Im looking for my car and was given your number I said. She then told me that she would text me the towing company number.... and it was the same number that I had previously called. Brilliant.   I called the towing company again. Yes they had my car and no I could not have it back -- not right now anyway. They open tomorrow morning at 8:00. I must bring $90 to get my car back. This absolutely sucks.  So lets back up a little bit. I picked Coach House because I thought it would be a good spot to escape the obnoxiousness that is more typical of the Scottsdale club scene and enjoy a beer in a laid back environment. But I guess its the holidays.... the older cougars were out hunting and the staff were generally unpleasant. Then my car got towed. The end. That is the last $90 that Coach House ever gets out of me so I hope their cut was worth it.',1
'The good:  Great happy hour.  Sushi rolls for $3 and $5 and until 7 pm.  Most sushi places put the basic rolls on happy hour but Stingray added a couple extras - the Las Vegas Roll was good with avocado smoked salmon and cream cheese and wrapped in tempura.  Next time Ill ask for it without the tempura. --My wife ordered the chicken salad and loved it.  Its got some sort of asian horseradish dressing that was really good. --Great location (for me) nice decor (not great but nice).  The Bad:  --Service.  There are two BIG clues a bartender/waiter needs to learn:  1) If wine glasses are empty (or getting close) ask if the customer would like a refill rather than waiting for them to flag you down; and  2) if my fork is turned over I am done eating.  Ask if you can clear the plates and bring anything else.  I shouldnt have to sit for 20 minutes next to my empty wine glass trying to get your attention so I can pay my bill.  The manager kept walking right in front of us also oblivious to the two BIG clues.  Maybe I bring this on myself by sitting at the bar instead of a table so your experience may be better.',3
'I find myself here nearly every other week because of the Target/PetSmart combo conveniently located by my job. I really loathe it. Overdone design creepy constant music the fact that the malls outdoors terrible parking lot planning....  Oh. And it shoots lasers.  Seriously.  Lasers! Are you freaking kidding?!? I guess this falls under overdone design.  I have had surprisingly good experiences at the movie theater here though. There are a lot of teens but for some reason they seem to misbehave less at Tempe Marketplace than at Chandler Fashion Square. Maybe Ive just been lucky.',2
'You know what I like about Busters? Its that its actually on a (faux) lake! Yes the lake isnt real but its big and houses live on it and if you close your eyes and try really hard you might forget we are in the desert without a whole lot of natural water sources.   When I visited Busters it was sadly in the 100s so we couldnt sit out on the patio but next time I will definitely make sure I do. Instead we sat in the bar area and enjoyed Cajun Chicken Cesar Salads. The salad itself was hearty and tasty. I added avocado for a little extra. The setting was decent and very old school Scottsdale. Translation: everything is a little older but clean and theres nothing trendy about this restaurant. I also really enjoyed the delicious bread they bring out to your table. I cant pinpoint the flavor but it reminded me of a bread Id have as a kid. Its a little sweet a little sugary and a lot of deliciousness. I also noticed that they have pop corn shrimp on the menu which I will definitely be ordering next time.   Busters is worth a visit but you have to come in expecting an old school restaurant on a faux lake. Its all A-OK. There is plenty of room for large parties. The menu can be pricey but if you order at the bar its definitely more reasonable.',3
'I needed a place that was quiet and clean for a quick overnight in the area.  This place was perfect.   The staff was extremely helpful and accommodated me with the quietest most remote room in the hotel. The shower was awesome (good pressure shower head and plenty of steamy hot water) and the bed was uber comfy. I would have appreciated a small continental breakfast for the price but at least they offered a really nice breakfast for around $10.',4
'Was on vacation heading off  to the ocean wanted to get a lure at Bass Pro Shops saw this restaurant and decided to find out what all the hoopla is all about.  I ordered a spicy chicken sandwich meal replete with the waffle fries. I had never had either.  I had never been in Chick-Fil-A either.  The lady behind the counter told me she would bring me my order.  Okay thats a twist a fast food joint bringing out your food. I guess not the only one that does that but far and few between.  She arrived with my order but not my cup of coffee.  She pointed over to a coffee pot - my bad didnt see it thought she was bringing everything to me.  No no she says Ill get it for you.  She went and got the next size larger than what I ordered and brought it to me. The chicken sandwich was absolutely delicious.  Wow type of delicious.  The waffle fries were good too.  I kind of like my fries a bit crunchier but they were tasty and they certainly can hold the ketchup in those waves that are created in them.  The restaurant area was immaculate.  It was an experience in itself.  Im definitely going to start frequenting Chick-Fil-A more often.',5
'Really enjoyed eating here.  Finally made the drive across the Valley for a weekday lunch.  There was no wait.  The hostess and servers were all very friendly.  Food was really good.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken platter with collard greens smothered potatoes and a gigantic corn muffin.  On top of that I added a biscuit piece of fried catfish and a chicken wing.  It was overkill but I wanted to try a little of everything and wasnt sure Id ever make it back over here.  The CFC was a gigantic breast filet perfectly juicy on the inside crispy on the outside and delicious.  Seriously big...about an inch thick and could feed three people!!  I could not believe how juicy that meat was!  It came smothered in sausage gravy. (see photo)  Gravy was good but next time Id ask for it on the side.  Greens were good.  Potatoes just okay.  Corn muffin was wonderful a little sweet just the way I prefer my corn bread.  Catfish had a nice flavor and perfect coating.  Honestly the best thing I had was that fried chicken wing...crispy juicy flavorful and makes you wish youd ordered more of it.  My sister got the Lo-los meal three pieces of fried chicken and 2 waffles.  She added a side of mac and cheese.  She thought all was great except for the breast piece which she found a tad dry and bland.  Her fave was the mac and cheese.   Oh and they had sweet tea on the menu...always a plus in my book!  Bottom line:  Good service.  Good food.  Dont go if youre looking to eat light.  Add on a chicken wing!  Or two.  Be prepared to nap afterwards.',4
'Ok for a quick bite',3
'I randomly found this place while waiting for some prints to finish up at OfficeMax.  I have of course been back since a few times.  Chicken fingers like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches have tragically been dismissed by most places as something not worth trying to make well.  Here however all things chicken are prepared and seasoned to actually have flavor and the myriad of unique sauces you can choose from enhance that.  The chicken sandwich is pretty much awesome;  The buns are a toasted (french?) bread with lots of chicken and sauce.  The special sauce is great although maybe a tad salty for my palette.  The hours for this place are sort of weird and I tend to prefer places that are open late but I recommend a visit if you find it open sometime.',4
'I love Indian Food.   Im constantly driving through this intersection and have always wanted to try it.  I finally got the chance and on top of that it was lunchtime and their sign said LUNCH SPECIALS.    I arrived around 11 am and the place is empty.  I ordered the dinner portion as I was sharing with my child.  $13 for Chicken Curry & Chicken Tikka Masala.  I also ordered a side of plain Naan.    The entree came with a row of rice that separated the two choices I made.  The rice tasted like something that came from Uncle Bens--no flavor and every time I scooped up rice there was a lot of water-soaked rice underneath.  The chicken curry and chicken masala tasted the same one was red the other wasnt.  Again very little flavor.    How can Indian food lack so much flavor???  The naan was just a flat bread nothing important about it... but it vaguely reminded me of the frozen Naan they sell at Trader Joes... and when I started thinking about it so did the Curry & Masala.  I ended up spending over $20 dollars for my meal that I shared with my young child.  I felt like I could have gotten the same thing at Trader Joes sans the watery rice for about $10.   I gave this place two stars... just based on the great service the waitress gave and another for it trying to be a healthy Indian restaurant.  Trust... go to the Indian Buffet in the airpark although its the real deal its worth the money and calories!',2
'Sports Illustrated rated this place as one of the twenty best sports bars in the country.  While thats probably a stretch the food and grog here are very good and there is always a TV nearby featuring sports.  Id be torn between 4 and 5 stars for Majerles but one time I was here eating a salad at the bar and Thunder Dan himself came up and asked how I was enjoying everything.  Very outgoing and friendly guy so lets give him 5 stars.',5
'On my boyfriends 23rd birthday we had a party of 6 arrive here. Very attentive service owner extremely nice and the chefs very fun. Would definitely recommend Alex! And recommend sharing a meal. It is a $7 up charge but beats paying another $20+ a plate.',5
'This used to be a favorite of ours but wow have things changed for the worse. Stopped by for a couple of slices last night and instead of the great pizza they used to make what we had could have easily been beaten by a frozen grocery store pizza. Very little cheese or sauce and what little cheese there was had zero flavor. The veggie slice was laughable - a cheese slice with a mound of canned veggies and a ridiculous amount of onions that were barely cooked. I dont remember them using canned mushrooms but they do now. No such thing a fresh ingredients here! Sad to see what used to be a 4 star pizza joint come to this.',1
'Go here for your 80s cover bands - Motley Crue Metallica etc.  Place is an extremely interesting time warp.',3
'Finally tried this place with friends from out of town. We went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and waited about 20 min for a table. The menu looks amazing! Wonderful sandwiches and salads as we waited and eyeballed the food coming out to other tables we were immediately impressed. I went with the veggie hummus pita wrap which came with super crispy sweet potato chips. My husband opted for the sweet potato tacos that I kept staring at. Our friends also ordered the sweet potato tacos and and the steak tacos.  We each thoroughly enjoyed our meals and with all plates cleaned we ordered a round of coffee and tea to finish the meal.  Everything was deliciously fresh good flavors. The decor is simple and clean and my friend commented that she felt like she was at a Virginia beach house. They passed the water glass test too-always a bonus. Great place!!!',5
'I loved the feel of this restaurant. When you first pull up you see a huge line. The line moves pretty quickly though. You get to sit in a wonderful area and have fabulous food.   Great spot for kids or if you want to bring your dogs.   The milkshake was to die for.',4
'Power went out unexpectedly in half of my house. Called and spoke with Preston who said he could come over right away. He showed on time & was able to fix the problem quickly. Turned out a loose fixture was breaking the electric connection to the rest of the house. Price was reasonable & work was done quickly. Ill be giving Dodge Electric a call next time I need work done:)',5
'I LOVE Kincaids! Especially with the updated decor and menu you just cant go wrong. Not to mention they have an incredible happy hour. Half off all appetizers $4 drafts (including Guinness WHAT?!) $4 glasses of wine and select specialty drinks. This is a great place to go if youre looking for a different spot before a game or concert even just a night out Downtown. The regular dining menu definitely doesnt dissapoint either - some of the freshest seafood and perfectly seared steaks! Clam chowder French Onion Soup even the salads. This place just knows how to do it. Cant wait to head back for happy hour soon. :)',5
'Nice little place with good solid French food.  The steak tartar was great and the other food pretty good.  Great little patio to dine in is a big plus now with our current best weather in the country status.  THis is the kind of place we need about a thousand of.',4
'If you are young and hot Miguel will move you to the front of line maybe even skip you a few more times just because he doesnt like the way you look.  I ended my service after 12 years of being a loyal customer.   This was not the only reason!  Just where I finally realized Verizon really does not appreciate its customers.',1
'The server was over the top obnoxious.   He insisted on having our names just to take our order.  He was very friendly but it was to the point of intrusive.  He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.    The manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table so we had to listen to all the Applebees rules and regulations.  Let me tell you there are a lot of them. The managers list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost every sentence started with I cant or  You cant.  The manager made me hate this place even more.',1
'Ive been to the Spotted Donkey Catina at El Pedrgal several times and it was always a pleasant experience.  Not the case at this new location.  Maybe the oil that fhe foods were prepared in was bad because not only was the flavor off but I had stomach problems later.  Service was below par as well....will not be returning.',1
'Surprisingly good. I thought with the fast design your own pizza strategy the product would suffer but I was definitely wrong. You get to pick out your own toppings and sauce and the pizza is cooked very quickly. Price is very reasonable and the quality is very good.  This location is a bit hard to find but I definitely suggest stopping by and giving Fired Pie a try. Its affordable fast and yummy. Next visit I want to try a salad in addition to a new pizza combination.',4
'Is it too much to call these cookies godlike?  Because they are really. I cant think of many times that I have had a cookie where I can taste every single ingredient in each bite.  Im not joking. Upon first bite of an Urban Cookie (I like to imagine a Blood Cookie yelling Wut up B!) lets say the amazing Pineapple Coconut you taste a savory buttery flavor then an intense and I mean intensely tart dried pineapple. The sugar both in the batter and the toasted coconut that tops the upper layer of the cookie helps cut through the tartness and leaves a great moistness in the mouth.  Love it.  Also the cookies are massive for their cost the store itself is very chic and trendy and the staff is very nice.  I would consider these for my wedding but I dont think the people coming are quite good enough for these cookies.',5
'Really good ribs and brisket. I like them best without the bbq sauce. The ribs are meaty and moist. The brisket melts in  your mouth and their red potatoes could be considered comfort food. Their regular bbq sauce is a bit to spicy for me and their sissy sauce is too tangy. I prefer a sweeter sauce or just a dry rub.  If you go plan ahead because there is usually long lines at peak meal times. Its a stand in line order at the counter food served in a paper wrapping then in a deep tray type of place. Picnic table style seating.  Theres plenty left to take home and the leftovers are even better!',4
'I am a way more frequent visitor of the bell rd location but sometimes I have to travel downtown for work. When I do I make my route pass by this place because I have to have dutch bros.  The guys at the bell location are pretty familiar with me by now but these guys still treat you as if you are there best customer. And its the best coffee Ive ever had.',5
'I love love love Elianas. I have been eating here for years and enjoy bringing people new to Salvadoran food. The interior is cheerfully decorated with colorful folk art and the service is always swift and friendly.   My favorite items on the menu are: 1) the pupusas kind of a soft gordita-like exterior with a meat and veggie thick stew-like interior - outrageously good!; 2) the yucca frita fried yucca plant (very starchy like potatoes) with some deep fried chunks of pork and garnished with radishes and cucumbers; 3) the ensalada drink a bright-yellow fruit beverage with finely chopped assorted fresh fruit- comes with a straw and a spoon; 4) the plantain with beans and sour cream a dish I wasnt sure about at first because I am very picky about my banana-type foods but it totally and unexpectedly works and is ridiculously delicious.  Elianas is so inexpensive and such a wonderful experience. Everyone can find something theyll like- low spiciness but full of great flavors and textures.',5
'DAM we cant wait to eat at the Beaver again! its true! its true!  But before I tell you how great it was a few things need to be mentioned. I was teetering between 4-5 stars on this one because of the European Style Service and I had to forgive them for using canned green beans in the green bean salad. However because of the really over the top seasoning of the prepared foods we tried and the UNIQUENESS of this Quirky one of a Kind place it deserves five stars. You also need to know that this is a Tiny Mom and Pop shop in a strip mall that is BYOB SCANDINAVIAN Bistro that makes your meals fresh to order and when we were the only order it took at least half and hour to prepare. This is not a fancy place and they provide some games like Yahtzee to play with while you wait.  We ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and the Gravlax platterthe platters come with THREE SIDE SALADS EACH and A SIDE DISH!  I had the Gravlax and it was sliced very thin was very fresh and very flavorful I think anyone who eats Lox would like the Gravlox here. For my side salads I picked the house made cole slawit was very light and fresh no creamy heavy sauce(it was very good)  tomato basil salad it was very fresh with lots of fresh basil and yummy balsamic  Peas (just plain) and for my side dish I picked the rosti potato. THAT POTATO was DELICIOUS but was SO LARGE it could feed a small country I could only eat about 1/4 of it.  My husband had the regular chicken schnitzel it was pounded thin  breaded just right and came with a side of mushroom sauceIt tasted very good. One of the sides he picked was the green bean salad and I noticed they are canned green beans that really is my only slight complaint on any food here.  They dont sell any desserts that are day old here only fresh made and they have the good humor to sell a dessert called Beaver Balls.',5
'The chicken tenders were disgraceful.  Reconstituted chicken parts worthy of McDonalds. Our cheese steak sandwich was good but not great as you expect it to be with the word gourmet in the title of the restaurant.  The service was great and very friendly which makes me sad that I have to give a generally unfavorable review.',2
'I love everything about this place!!  They have a completely organic vegetarian menu and they do not cook with Canola Oil.  They also offer gluten free and vegan items.  I can rest assured that I am not eating any GMOs or processed food here which is so important to me and hard to find in a restaurant these days.  They also offer an amazing large selection of teas and healthy beverages.  The atmosphere is great too.  Its a cozy little tea house in a nice courtyard area.  A great place to hang out and relax while enjoying delicious nurishing meals!',5
'Best sides dishes of any of its competition and the chicken aint half bad either.  They have changed their service to ceramic plates and metal siverware if you eat in.  The chicken has always been good and the sides great for a fast food environment.',4
'This was my familys first time in. We spent 55 for a family of four. Showed up at 8:15..closes at 9. AFTER we paid and sat down we were told they only had rice for one plate.  Disappointment at that moment.  Food was okay..chicken somewhat bland. Would not go back.',3
'Beautiful glassware',4
'Ordered two sandwiches to go. The food was freshly prepared the bread was good. It wasnt quite as amazing as I remembered the Las Vegas location; but it was good and a smidgen closer. :-)',4
'I believe it is safe now after a half a dozen visits and never being disappointed to review Roys.  My most recent visit (last week) was pretty typical. FABULOUS service from a Lady who knew exactly how to successfully wait on a small party. As usual her impeccable service made the experience all the more enjoyable.  I always have a difficult time NOT having The Butter Fish dish. It had been voted as one of the Top Ten Dishes in Las Vegas when I lived there a couple of years ago and although I have never eaten Butterfish anywhere else - OUT OF THIS WORLD!  On this particular visit our party had a couple of Appetizers (Pot Stickers Sea Scallops) and two salads (Chopped Maui Wowie Shrimp) as well as the aforementioned Butterfish entrée our other entrees included Salmon and both of the available Mahi Mahi dishes.  EVERYTHING was prepared superbly and I can honestly say that outside of Legals (East Coast) Roys does fish better than any other Chain and better than most Independents specializing in fish.  A great treat every visit and this past one was as good if not better thanany!    Cant miss here.',5

'OK Ive got the inside skinny on this place and Im gonna shoot straight. Ive decided to edit DOWN this review as this place doesnt deserve all the BLAH BLAH Ive given it. On the corner of 6th and Mill in Tempe.  Park for free at 5th and Farmer across the railroad tracks. Mill Ave. is all metered parking now. Ive been waiting for W.O.B. to open for ages and finally stopped in for a stiff 12oz. Oskar Blues Old Chub (8% ABV) to check out the place. With tip I think the beer was $8.59. OUCH. Kiss my ass!  The place DOES have a wide selection of good beers a beer connoiseur would expect as well as many locals but you sure as hell pay for it. Theyre milking Mill Ave. for all its worth thats for sure and pandering to the university crowd with HALF OFF drafts for university students faculty and staff on Wednesdays.  All you public sheeple have to get a Loyalty Card or show up for happy hour for any sort of discount which is definitely LESS than half off. Makes me want to get a student ID again (I graduated with a B.Sc. in the 90s thank you very much) so I can have my ass kissed by everyone who wants my money rather than be the ass kisser of places who think theyre doing me a favor by being there.   W.O.B. is a sports bar with good beer and NO FOOD but I understand they partnered with a few local places that will deliver in. The place is small and I fully expect it to be packed with university rookies when school starts. Im not looking forward to this. I hate zoos and so do the local beer snobs.  Sure the place has lots of great beers but the atmosphere is cow-herdy and loud  and you should take advantage of price breaks whenever possible or get ready to feel regretful.  If its crowded JUST WALK BACK OUT. Good luck getting a seat and squeezing in and ordering is a royal pain.  Nobody goes there its too crowded.  -- Yogi Berra  If you plan to go at all go early happy hour then split when the ant farm comes in.  However Im glad for its presence because its contributing to beer consciousness and the growth of the craft beer industry by showing people theres more to beer than fizzy yellow rat piss.   Bottom line is I wont be a regular here I might stop in for some tap takeovers or other promo events but I refuse to pay full price when I can drink incredible beers for much less elsewhere. No Im not telling you where.   HOWEVER theres a place that can handle ANY crowd with speed and efficiency has plenty of seating friendly staff that has time to talk to you has incredible beers on tap and in the fridge AND IN-HOUSE food with pizzas to die for and that is PAPAGO BREWING in south Scottsdale at McDowell and Scottsdale Rd in the plaza next to the Mandarin Buffet. Have fun  getting annoyed at W.O.B. sheeple! Or head to PAPAGO where they keep it real.',2
'I have visited this location COUNTLESS times over the years so Im surprised I hadnt reviewed it until now.   The food here is fresh properly tempered and the store is VERY clean...well except the bathroom. The bathroom is always a disaster. Im not sure why. Even after the remodel the womens bathroom always is sticky dirty and just makes me feel like I need to go shower afterwards. Its weird.   The staff is usually very nice and friendly but they get very frazzled when the place is busy...and this location is BIZ-EEE. When the snowbirds come and especially during Spring Training this store is PACKED. As a local I usually skip STs lunch time mid-February through beginning of April because its just too busy.   All in all though this is a good location with consistently good food.  The only other aspect of this store that prevents it from getting 5 stars is that Sweet Tomatoes is ridiculously over priced. Its soup and salad for goodness sake. It shouldnt cost me $25 for 2 people to eat soup and salad with a drink. But thats just me. :)',4
'Oh.... My.... God....  Its been a loooooong time since Ive been served food this bad before. We ordered beef egg foo young honey garlic pork barbeque ribs and it came with white rice.  The rice was good and was by far the highlight of our meal.   The beef egg foo young was some sort of high-density hockey puck (that was supposed to be the egg foo young). It had the texture of leather but didnt taste as good as leather. It was slathered with a brown gravy that had pieces of beef but the beef was gristle-y and unappetizing.   The BBQ ribs looked very good but this was misleading. One taste suggested this food had turned and we didnt eat any more for fear of getting sick.  The honey garlic pork dish was tolerable. It was small breaded pieces of pork in a sauce that tasted neither like honey nor like garlic.  The white rice was good and sticky as white rice should be.  The restaurant was clean to their credit including the bathroom.  I will NEVER go to this place again. Its hard to believe a place this bad remains in business. It wasnt even particularly well-priced.',1
'I really really really wanted to love this place.  Almost all Asian customers.  The waitress was the nicest waitress I have ever encountered.    I had the eggplant and potatoes with jalapeno.  Only I asked for just a tiny bit of jalapenos because I am a wimp.  The waitress misunderstood our discussion and substituted green pepper for the jalapeno and I dont like green pepper.  The food was super greasy and almost flavorless.  :(  Wont be back.',3
'Oggies pizza is devine!  Ive been to this location several times and each time the crust has been perfect soft chewy and you can even smell the yeast!  They have lots of fun topping combinations on the menu and their desserts are great too!  Be sure to check out their happy hour menu for good deals on food & drinks!',5
'Super spicy and delicious New Mexico style cuisine. We had three different entrees and all were wonderful. The margaritas were especially tasty large and not too sweet. Wed definitely come back! My only complaint is that I wish they had a few more vegetarian options.  Try: The Enchilada Dinner (with red chili and blue corn tortilla)',4
'I first found this place while walking the mall with my sister. We saw a big sign in the window that said Free Sex inside...So of course we had to check the place out...  I was transfixed with the shampoo bars. We travel alot and I wanted something compact and non-messy. The bar in the tin was perfect!   My husband was skeptical and thought it was a lot of money for just a small shampoo bar and he scoffed about it a bit. But when we were staying at a hotel in Cali - he got the chance to use it for the first time and he loved how it foamed and how such a little went a long way. Not to mention how soft it made his hair.  When we finally ran out - it was HIM going down to buy more. Hes not the only manly~man I know who only uses Lush products to wash their hair...Scotty Bravo from The Surfside IV is a big fan (and his hair is what gave him his name.)',5
'Not sure if there is a secret society of Asian donut shop owners in America but no matter what city I enter the Asian owned doughnut shops are all very similiar. To BOSAs credit they did have some weekend only choices which included Strawberry Cream or Blueberry Cream cake but overall it was the standard assortment of items at about $1 per donut these days. Phoenix is not a donut town and despite the wide variety the two donuts I tried (cream cake and glazed cake) both tasted like the icing with neither the buttermilk or strawberry flavors shining through.',3
'As a vegetarian I am always looking for good restaurants that can accommodate my dietary restrictions with style and the Herb Box did just that. They have a great patio that overlooks the canal and I will definitely keep this restaurant in my rotation.',4
'This was the second place I requested to go on our trip to Arizona. My boyfriend isnt as into Soul Food as I am but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.  Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a jar of drank Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.  My boyfriend ordered Nay Nays breakfast two waffles two eggs and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually dont like grits but they were good here. There was so much butter on them I dont know how somebody couldnt like them!  I went with the Lolos Famous Soul Food Platter and I chose three pieces of fried chicken mac & cheese and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too very sweet.  The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch we left full and happy. I am sure we will come here again whenever we visit Arizona.',5
'The search for a great chili dog in Phoenix sadly continues. I had such high hopes for Dazzos. They have a drive thru too.   I was advised they make a really good dog. I went yesterday thinking this would be perfect not to far from the house. Cash in hand I head out since they only take cash. I ordered a chili dog with mustard and onions $3.49 WTF? and a large fry $1.85. I thought if its a great dog then the price is justified.   The dog was good not great but good. It would have been better had it been hot the dog was ice cold the bun was warmer. The Chili was tasty but luke warm. The fries were smoking hot and tons of them. They wrapped them with the dog and put them in a bag then piled them in the bag the dog and fries were already in. I liked the fries some should have cooked a little longer but they were good.   Sorry forgot to take a pic of this messy goodness. The dog is all beef served in a poppy seed bun which is very soft and fresh. The chili is unlike what I am used to. Back home when its on a dog it has no beans. I know other parts of the country use a chili sauce with beans to each his own. I prefer without beans but these tasted good. So whatever just thought you should know what you are getting yourself into at Dazzos.  The fries are larger than McDonalds and they have the skin on I quite like that. The dog was very messy had to use a knife and fork.   All and all I gave them an A-ok the taste was there the temperature was not. I think they have the prices wrong. 1.85 should have been the dog and 3.49 for all those fries. It evened itself out in the end. Also I think the fries would be good with vinegar.  To Megan - Clearly you have never been to the Ghetto please remain seated in your ivory tower and enjoy the view. While Dazzo is not in the trendy area of Glendale it is not the ghetto either. Thanks!',3

'The staff here is great they always remember who you are when you come in and are very helpfull when trying to decide on a lotion.  I love the black beauty bed and I can always get in a bed of some sort when I go.  Love this place',5
'I havent had Chipotle in a while and suddenly found myself inside here waiting in a very long line to place my order.  Its been a while since Ive eaten here so I figured it was time!  When I entered it was the dinner rush so there was a very long line.  Ahead of me were 4 Phoenix fireman along with a UPS driver.  Nice!   Despite the line being painfully long I placed my order.  I got the Fajita burrito with the shredded beef.  Tasty!    I do have to give a kudos to the staff here.  Clearly they were extremely busy and despite that I was treated with courtesy and a smilng face!  That goes a long way for me as I know how frustrating it can be when you are looking at a line out the door.    I also really like how thier menus set up.  Fairly simple with nice choices to choose from.  Not to complicated easy to understand and a fair price point.  Really enjoyed my time here and the staff was wonderful. Will return in the future!',4
'WOW what a wonderful experience for the neighborhood feel and grrrreat food.  Met up with a friend for the first time here and it was grrrrrrrrrreat.  Justin helped us out and he was absolutely STELLAR!  He gave us some wicked reccomendations and the good stuff just kept on coming.  We had the OHSO and Beet salad coupled with the AMAZING cheese plate!  The red dragon cheese is fantastic!  Justin suggested the Nitro Milk Stout and it was super good as well.  Kind of like a big kids chocolate milk shake!  For the first time run I felt at home like I had been going there for years.  Im going to be questing to taste all of the beers that they have to offer along with the food.  I noticed that on the menu that they lacked a lot of the fried items that youd typically find for pub grub which is AWESOME.  As Im already tacking on all the beer energy healtier options to stuff my face are always welcomed.  Definately will be returning again and again!',5
'A friend and I finally decided to go on and explore Moira after our two favorite spots to chill at and have a couple of drinks were completely full.  As we enter we were promptly greeted by our hostess and shown our seats but keep in mind the place was about a quarter of the way full on a Saturday.    The ambiance of this the place is very cool and dark kinda like The Roosevelt with bar standing out with the bluish neon lights that were displaying the sharp angles and the reflective metals that werent noticeable at first.  Our waitress was engaging and always at our attention.  She informed us that this spot is the neighborhoods little secret and mostly filled with locals.  She looked like a cut out from comic con and I know that could be a little stereotypical but I believe that it probably added to Moiras identity.  I wasnt sure what I wanted to drink so our waitress recommended the Hitachino Nest White Ale which was a great choice.  We order the Udon noodle soup and Vegas sushi.  The Udon noodle soup was good with Low Mein noodles and beefy broth but I believe that this bowl is reserved for vegetarians.  Now the Vegas sushi rolls were just utterly amazing!  Served with sides of Wasabi and some shavings that have a citrusy taste and with that combination my tongue has been resurrected.  I couldnt believe that my tongue could experience such a degree of exhilaration.   I highly recommend Moira.  This place is adorable and the food is great with a decent price range compare with its local hotspot neighbors.  I cant believe that I was always passing by Moira without knowing what a jewel I had in my own neighborhood.  Moira will definitely be put in my weekly rotation of hangouts that I go to see you there...  Note this was my first time eating sushi and for me this is the standard.',5
'This place confounds me...  They have an excellent beer and wine selection. As a matter of fact their beer selection is one of the best Ive seen in AZ. Tons of micro-beers and many different and unique bottles of rare Euro- brau. For the selection to stop by and pick something up and go this place is great. As a restaurant/Wine Bar bar I give this place a big...Meh.  The service was terrible. Of the party of 6 everyone that ordered a glass of wine only got one. They sat with their glasses empty for at least 30 minutes. Those of us drinking beer just walked over to cooler and grabbed a beer. We also had an appetizer. We got the warm pretzels with gourmet mustard. It was frozen pretzels they microwaved with Honey mustard. They were still cool in the middle and a little stale.   Maybe it was just an off night or something Ill probably give it another shot.',3
'I really wanted to give this place 4 stars but just couldnt bring myself to do it.  Nice enough place and a friendly staff even when slammed on a Sunday morning. But the food was a mixed bag. Ordered three items: Pollo Omelette Chicken Fried Steak and of course we had to try the Waffle Dogs. The omelette was a disaster. It might have been the driest omelette Ive ever had. No jalepeno or heat to the dish even though that it was a main ingredient. Looked unappetizing when they set the plate on the table. Now to the other side of the spectrum...the chicken fried steak certainly lived up to the hype. Delicious tender gravy was perfect consistency and the fried egg on top made this a dish worth going back for. And finally the waffle dogs. I think my expectations got the better of me here. I was expecting a dish that was going to knock me off my chair but what I ended up with was glorified albeit quite tasty fair food. The sausage could have had a bit more flavoring as it just wasnt savory enough to balance the waffle batter and maple syrup (syrup was delicious BTW). Conclusion I will certainly give this place another try. Maybe it was just a bad day for the omelette cook.',3
'This place is excellent. Both quantity and quality! There salsa bar is amazing. They have a unique avacado and jalepeno cream style sauce that is very good. They also have free fried onions and jalepenos for free with food purchase. Caution the fried jalepenos can be hot actually the hottest Ive ever had but not always. My favorite is the Arizona burrito but theres a ton to cheese from. There side of Flautas is a meal in itself. Great authentic food at a great price.',5
'We had the most amazing breakfast buffet here while staying at the Camelback Inn. The restaurant is very beautiful interesting glass fixture hanging thru out rich dark woods nice views of the patio.   The buffet include omelets the best hash brown potatoes in the world. Other food choices include juevos rancheros fresh pastries breads bagels muffins bacon sausage cured meats yogurts fresh fruits granola cereal etc. Service here is also amazing. I highly recommend Ritas for breakfast.',5
'Stopped in for lunch one afternoon and had a tortilla crusted chicken and spinach salad. HANDS DOWN the best salad I have ever had I did nothing short of lick the bowl.   WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!!  Ill be back again and again.',5
'Id like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only. Ive never eaten in the main restaurant here.   I LOVE Mastros Ocean Club but I dont really feel the same emotion about Mastros City Hall. Dont get me wrong - City Hall has great food most of the time. The problem is Mastros just isnt consistent. On one occasion I could swear I had the best steak I ever had in my life but on another occasion I thought my filet was something I accidentally burned on the BBQ. On one occasion I had amazing oysters but on another they were not cleaned correctly which ruined the experience. These are just some of the examples of the inconsistency and the reason I just cant bring myself to give City Hall 5 stars like the partner restaurant Ocean Club.   If I were to recommend one of Mastros restaurants to a friend Id tell them to save their money for Ocean Club.  However Id like to add that the bar is great at City Hall. So if you are just going for drinks you cant go wrong.',3
'OK I can never NOT do my Lucky Charm meets Irish Spring accent when Im here. Not only am I sure I sound imbibed before I even consume my first black and tan but the staff must surely have heard every Irish accent attempt known to mankind. Love the draft beers here. Love the meatloaf sandwich. Mostly  love the pub atmosphere and what seems to be A LOT of regulars. One particular server is fantastic. A cherubic faced server not without life lines complete with a delicious accent. My friend thinks she fakes it. The accent that is. Thats fine with me as long as the grub and ale are magically delicious and at some point I get to say manly yes but I like it too!',4
'I travel from Tolleson here and there is a dentist right across the street from my house. Thats how much I love this place. I have really bad teeth and always need something when I go to the dentist. I have had 3 crowns done here and every time its a breeze. They make it super comfortable and even have TVs on the ceiling for you to watch. The best part is they have a CEREC machine which creates a permanent crown for you right on the spot. No wearing a temporary and waiting two weeks. Only a few places in the valley have this.  My dentist is Dr. DeMark and he is the best dentist Ive ever been too. He makes my appointments painless and easy. He even calls you that night to make sure everything is ok.   The office is super clean and the staff is super friendly. As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will always come here.',5
'Ordered a coconut craze and it tastes like Im eating frozen yogurt- not the healthy smoothie that I was expecting.  Ill give them another shot and order something different next time.....',2
'We showed up at 2 am after a grueling 11 hour drive through LA traffic. The man working at the front desk welcomed us with bottled water complimented the cuteness of our dog waived the pet fee gave us a deal on the rate of the room and free access to the wifi network. The room was impeccably clean the bathroom was a little tight but stylish and clean the bedding was really soft and fluffy the coffee maker was AWESOME (just remember to unplug as to not blow the circuit).   We were visiting for an event which was held on the property: the service was excellent. Polite attentive and quick on their feet. I left wondering why I hadnt stayed in a Hilton before. It was a great surprise after all that driving and definitely worth the trip.',5
'If your new to AZ youll want to put Kierland Commons on your list of top places to shop at.   I love this place and choose it over all others. I just wish they had the major department stores here too.   This is a strip mall and outside shopping. They have a lot of the coolest high-end shops here too; and great dining.   I hit the Starbucks up and then shop away. They are starting to know me by name LOL!',5
'Love breakfast at Braggs the banana pancakes and the curry tofu are my two favorites.  Always good food and they always have a special to check out',5
'Fastest service ever! I love getting breakfast here because I know it will never make me late! The employees are so friendly too!  During once visit I had been dieting for a while and decided to treat myself to some fries but they were less than warm. Any other time and I would have eaten them but I had been craving them so bad!! They happily made me some fresh fries and chatted with me while I waited! It made my day ;)',5
'love this place! great location amazing patio and dog friendly! And I usually dont like bar food but they have really good food! Great place for happy hour and any hour! so glad its in the neighborhood!!',5
'I really want to give ZPizza 4 stars but its just not a 4-star pizzeria. Their veggie pizza is the best out of any delivery Ive had but doesnt rival Cibo or even Sauce.    The upside: Good veggie/vegan options. - You can opt for the whole wheat crust for no extra charge (the gluten-free crust is a $3-4 upcharge).  -Their California Veggie and Moroccan eggplant pesto pizza are divine.  -Theres an ice cream parlor next door. - Their iced tea isnt awful.  The downside:  THE SERVICE. - We always order and pick up -- and are consistently on hold for more than 5 minutes often times having to call back because they hung up.  - There are a few people working at this location who clearly hate their jobs. Their attitude and manner is really unpleasant to be around. I get it you work at a pizza place and youre not that happy... but WHY take it out on the customers?   I came in the other night and watched a guy stand in line in front of me for about 8 minutes (he was already there when I arrived) while the girl at the front was on the phone. Theres another register.. yet no one came up to help him. He ordered slices and by the time I told them what I was picking up added a slice and got my drinks he was STILL waiting. This poor guy waited 20 minutes just to get 2 slices of pizza that was already premade and in the case! Thats just careless service.',3
'Very impressed by this place! My girlfriend and I were planning on brunch and some shopping and were looking for a place with which to do our nails. Cant miss that- classic girl date activity right? We tried at the last minute to make appointments at some place right in Old Town Scottsdale to no avail.   She found this place on her Yelp app and said it had good reviews and they were open! So we decided to give it a shot.   I think I have a new nail place now. Nevermind that I live way on the north side of town. I dont need to do a pedicure all that often anyway! Its in a quiet little strip mall tucked on the north side of Indian School road closer to Mclintock than Rural. If you werent looking youd probably miss if. And if I remember right it doesnt even say Pro Nails by Julie on the sign. Just Pro Nails.   When you step inside youll notice its lovely in a sort of splash various shades of baby and hot pink everywhere sort of way. Very clean and new and spacious. There are TONS of pedicure chairs lined up along both walls and there wasnt a shortage of nail technicians to take care of us. They pay attention to the small details like having disposable liners in each of the foot baths. Orange slices float in the hot water. (Orange slices! Really!! Am I too bourgeois since Im so impressed by this??)  They advertise that they only have a $23 spa pedicure and a $33 spa pedicure but in reality they have many grades in between. After I sat down I was handed a laminated sheet that had different grades. I remember getting the $28 one- I believe it came with a scrub and some other nice things but I dont think it had a paraffin wax massage or anything super fancy. So know that you can really pick and choose how much you want to be pampered.   They have a great range of nail colors that are very much up to date- I was able to get the Liquid Sand nail polish in the shade Jynx from the Bond Girls collection for my toes. It is fairly recent I believe. Recent enough and popular enough that I couldnt find it in two Ulta stores I went to- I loved the color so much I wanted to try and purchase it. No luck there.   My tech was very quick but very good. I was done much faster than both my girlfriend and a really sweet lady chatting with us on my other side. The rest of the experience was pretty standard. Youre led to a foot drier- they gave me those little rubber flip flop things as the only pair of sandals I have would ruin a too-fresh pedi. What can I say? Im not a flip flop sort of girl at all. I paid and tipped both with my card and you can even get a frequent flier punch card which I still have.  All in all probably the best pedicure place Ive been to in the greater Phoenix area. Ill be back.',5
'A major fan of this thrift store.  As much as I am not a fan of Arizona...this place stole my heart!  If youre a true thrifter and not a snob about places being modernized and blah blah blah....then youll definitely love this store.  The staff is very nice and helpful. Things are not overpriced/marked up like at some resale or so called thrift stores...This one has something for everyone....whether youre a fashionista on a budget college kid looking for some housewares or a low-income family trying to keep things afloat...youll leave with a smile on your face.   xoxo enjoy.  p.s. it is very organized and clean! parking is never a problem.',5
'Well I have to say for being a small place in central Phoenix this has some of the best sushi in the city. Hana is owned by the same guy who used to have the place in the Biltmore called Ayako.  You get great customer service and really great quality sushi. The prices are as generous as the portions. It is a really low key unpretentious place right across the street from channel 3 on 7th ave and Missouri.  I love going here for lunch and dinner...even though its out of my way. If you are looking for a new place for sushi that doesnt have that chain feel to it this is your place. Make a trip to Hana.',5

'I had been to noRTH a few times both for dinner and happy hour and decided to I trounce a few friends to my new happy hour pic. I got there about 20 minutes early got a table and ordered a glass of wine. It was very busy loud and a bit crazy on that night. I waited for friends who called me to say that when they attempted to valet park they were told the lot was full. They werent offered an alternative. They decided to park in the lot of the sopping center to the west and were told by the security guard there that parking was not for the patrons of the restaurant and their cars would be towed if they parked there. They told me theyd meet me at Chelseas kitchen. I told my waitress and had to cash out on the glass of wine that I hadnt even had a chance to try. I was furious! I left the manager came out as I waited 15 minutes to get my car and she asked why I was leaving. I explained. She said that they could have parked at the circle k or 7 eleven or whatever is across the street and I asked why the valet hadnt told my friends that. She said she didnt know - was sorry-and that was it. Didnt comp the drink I didnt drink I felt obliged to tip both the waitress and valet modestly but overall arrived almost a half an hour after my friends at Chelseas and it was a very bad experience all around! I wont be meeting anyone there again. Although it only happened once out of four times there once was enough!',3
'What an amazing out of the way find! Have been here several times (wont review a good Restaurant unless I have been to it twice) and have NOT been disappointed in the least.  Sandwiches are a trademark and I have had several that are all unique and delicious. Bigger appetite have dinner here. Not fancy (no white linen) but the food will wow! Even something as simple as a Mixed Grill was uniquely prepared and delicious. Soups are also a specialty and if the soup is great - theyve got me! Great it is.  A fair distance for most to travel but worth the drive out. Check for open hours as they can be strange.',5
'I really wish that they had chosen another location for Carolinas as my office shares the same parking lot and it is way too easy for me to walk across the parking lot and grab some of the best grub around.  Very hard to keep in marathon shape when eating there 4 times a week-I am weak with the discipline.  Their tortillas are the best in town hands down.  I had never tried a buttered or cheese tortilla until a co-worker ordered a few...very addicting.  They only have one salsa which is not fiery but has a kick and their chicken burritos are just that chicken and a tortilla.  No Chipotle style faire here. There is ample parking but seating can be a problem for those who dont work next door.  Hit em up if in the area!',5
'First arrival a nightmare. Get there valet man says we can park in ramp if we would like is cheaper and elevator is right at side door NOT ! So I go to front desk and complain and the ditz tells me we can just drive  back out and not pay because we were not there even 10 minutes.  NOT told attendant what she said he said no. We explained what ditzy said he said they have no right but he eventually let us. Took luggage out at front door and went back to parking lot. They did nothing to appease us till I went back down to the front desk. They sent up a lousy 4 cans of pop and crappy dried nuts and 4 granola bars at 9:30 p.m.! I am in the people business you are suppose to bend over backwards for your customers NOT Hyatt! I do not think I would ever tell anyone to stay there between the parking nightmare and the nonchalant attitude of the front desk.',2
'I havent had nearly the poor experience the other reviewers had but I also never go in expecting much. Everyone I have spoken to was pleasant and a couple helped me find things I needed. They always ask how Im doing and if I need help and seem fairly genuine about it. Checkout isnt bad at all they always seem to have enough cashiers to manage the line of customers.  If you want to feel appreciated for your purchase of higher end products (Urban Decay Clinique etc.) to go a department store or even Sephora. Everything else is drugstore brand/quality so why would you be expecting the white glove treatment for $7 mascara?',3
'On our second time eating at Tom Yum we had a very disappointing experience.  It was about 5:45 and the restaurant was not busy.  There were 3 of us ordering.  My husband got has meal first.  After a long wait my mother got her food.  My husband was over half way done with his meal before my meal was brought to the table.  When I looked at it I thought it did not seem to be what I ordered.  It was loaded with bean sprouts and my meal was supposed to have broccoli and no bean sprouts..  I looked at the menu and was sure it was wrong.  When we told the waitress she said they must have mixed up the order and would cook the right dish. So I sat and waited again. We were charged for my meal even though the other 2 diners at my table were finished before my food ever came.   I noticed at other tables people received their meals at different times too.. The whole experience was very poorly handled by the kitchen and servers.',2
'A far cry from the South Scottsdale location. The wings I ordered were ice cold! when I brought them back to the counter the lady said nothing and threw them into a microwave. I kid you not! If you want good wings try another location. PROS : I didnt get e-coli.',1
'With all the hype around sprinkles I decided to drive around this weekend and check out the cupcake places around town.  What a disappointment. The store is tiny NO NONE NADA organization to handle customers. It was an absolute mad house. People acting like drones standing in a huddled mass waiting for someone to get them a freakin over priced cupcake. It was an absolute joke.  I ended up leaving after waiting 10 minutes and still no one to get me a cupcake.   Maybe the Hollywood cupcake madam should come and tend to her Scottsdale store.',1
'I noticed my brakes squeaking and grinding so I took my car to my regular mechanic for an oil change and asked him to check it out.  He said I needed new brakes and rotors at the tune of $415.00.  I decided to get more opinions so I went 5 places total and all 5 gave me the same diagnosis.  However the price out the door at Brakes Plus was $279.00 (they gave me a coupon book which included a $50 off coupon) and they treated me with the most respect out of anybody I went to see.  To top it off they let me drive their company car back to work so I didnt have to sit there and wait!  Brakes Plus is now my regular mechanic and I will be using them and the other $25 coupon for my 60K service.  Thanks guys!!',5
'As a huge baseball fan and huge fan of baseball parks in general Ive been licking my chops of having the chance to visit Chase Field. Coming from New York in which our ballparks are pretty much on their last legs - I couldnt wait to see a ballpark built in my life time. Chase Field which was built for the 1998 season is probably one of the best ballparks Ive seen a game at.  It is located in the downtown Phoenix roughly two blocks away from US Airways Arena. How they situated this ballpark was pretty clever - a bar for pre-game festivities across from the ballpark in a plaza which is across from that is the parking garage.  For those who dont know Chase Field is a retractable roof stadium depending on what the weather is like - theyll either keep it open and let the air flow in or keep it closed and pump the AC. From the outside in the distance the stadium looks like an airplane hanger. That just gives you a feeling on how massive this ballpark is.  The atmosphere and layout of the park itself is one of the best. I walked in through the rotunda entrance and immediately saw the field. Im not used to seeing the field so quickly as Ive only been to stadiums in which you cannot see the field from the concourse. You can walk around the stadium and not miss a pitch. Chase Field gave me the feeling of a shopping malls food court. There is food everywhere chain restaurants and ballpark staples all encompassing the stadiums concourse. This is a huge perk because you dont have to walk far in order to get what you crave. There is a Panda Express TGIFridays and a Fatburger located within the ballpark so you have plenty of choices to eat during the game.  I purchased field tickets for $35 which gives you a great seat for a great price it is a breath of fresh air coming out of NYC and seeing a game from the field for less than $50.  Concession prices are good as well I fed myself with a sausage and a beer for less than $13. I find that pretty good for a newer ballpark in this day in age of inflated concession prices. I usually pay near $20 at my home ballpark (Shea Stadium) when Im hungry.    Coming from New York I know what a baseball games atmosphere is supposed to be like. Maybe Im not used to it but the fans here didnt seem to be paying attention to the game that much especially during a pitchers duel. The game was won in the bottom of the 10th with a walk-off home-run. I guess that is what happens when you model your stadium after a shopping mall people tend to forget about the main reason why they are there.  As of August 08: Chase Field Ranks #1 of the 5 ballparks Ive seen.',5
'Delicious food!  Excellent service!',5
'Im still kind of confused about how I feel about this place.  I had high hopes for it and was a bit let down.  Yes finding this place is fun and I am glad I studied all the Yelp photos and reviews on how to find this place (thanks guys!) because I probably would have given up and just gone to Postino as walking around Old Town in heels aint my thang.   Joshua F. and I went on a Saturday night in July while they were running some kind of Christmas in July special.  While I truly appreciate specials and discounts I did not appreciate all the cheesy Christmas decor they had all over the place - a fake tree Christmas music cardboard cut-out decor light stands everywhere.  I feel like I wasnt able to experience the cozy dark ambiance of this wine bar.   I was also taken aback by the prices of their wine flights ($15 - $27 for 3 - 9oz total) and $6 for a draft beer - but once you remember you are in Scottsdale it makes more sense.  This isnt your typical Saturday night in Old Town location - a little older crowd with a little more clothing on.  I might try this place again just because I wanted to like it so much - maybe during a week night (not in July) after I get a raise and have so much money that I feel I deserve overpriced alcohol.',2
'Went to the bar at Black Angus to have some drinks and pubbish food for my birthday.  (remember when it was called Square Cow Fun Bar and there was all you can eat buffet?  Me neither - but my mother does).  Got three apps six adult beverages for $30 - superfast service - also brought the warm bread (even though we didnt end up eating entrees).  Nice ambiance squeaky clean good prices and decent apps.  Will definitely be back! :)',4
'Clean and fresh simple preparations excellent ingredients. Great specials for budget conscious. Gobs of cheese for the cheese lover and great sandwiches.   --great air conditioning and ceiling fans throughout.  --counter service makes for a nice casual feel not pretentious or trying to go too far --order taker is efficient and transaction is speedy; nearby monitor shows pictures of their best plates in case you cant decide --5-seat bar for some great wine tasting or an espresso with the owner --self-service beverage station is clean and fresh. Lemons freshly sliced and cold! --make your own bread dipping sauce with olive oil carafe and spice mix shaker both fresh and clean --Parmesan is also at the table and is real flaky moist an guess what? Fresh! --vinaigrette is something powerful strong and bursts of flavor --fresh Roma tomatoes juicy and taste organic not typical Arizona waxskins --presentation detail is appropriate for the prices.  Only complaint is the bread. Others here say its freshly baked and excellent but it tastes eggy and spongy to me. Reminds me of those egg bagels from Einsteins. EW.',3
'Absolutely love clutch!!!! Cant get enough pieces! The leather wrap bracelets are my favorite! Never wore too much jewelry but after clutch I was obessed with the way everything fit so perfectly!!!!!',5
'Good steakhouse.  Ive been here about half a dozen times.  Ive never had a bad experience with the food here or the service.  I prefer this over Mortons and Ruths Cris but not over City Hall or Mastros other steakhouse up in North Scottsdale.   Standard menu.  Everything is a la carte like other fine steak houses.  If you go here you will not be disappointed...but be sure to make reservations.',4
'I stopped in today since I was driving by. I was seated immediately by a friendly young lady. I had plenty of time to look over the happy hour menu. Seven minutes after being seated I still had not been offered a glass of water or drink. As I was walking out I noticed what must have been the chef and a majority of the wait staff huddled in the corner. Hope your meeting was worth it because you have lost my business for good. No plans to return.',1
'This place does not disappoint.  Make sure you come hungry.  The service and selection are amazing.  They serve as a team so you never have to wait to ask anyone for anything.  It does not matter who is walking by.  Should you need something anyone will bring it to you.  Including any cuts of meat you want to visit again or havent tried.  Great for a date or company party.  We have done both and were very happy.  This place will always be a crowd pleaser; if you have company from out of town they will not be let down.  I highly recommend the Sangria.  It is made from scratch.',5
'Awesome cornbread for a starter. Wifey had a great chicken salad where they use real grilled chicken instead of that weird chicken breast stuff thats at most places. I had the filet and it was phenomenal! Cooked to a perfect rare with a great worcestershire butter topping it. Our waiter was also on top of his game and took great care of us. I will definitely be going back next time Im in that area.',5
'First it was kosher. Then it was kosher-style. Now its kosher again (and has been for several years.) The recipes never changed - the politics of this silly town did.  And all along its been my favorite little Jewish bakery in town. Chompies is nothing in comparison!  The Raspberry Delight cake has been my favorite cake EVER consistently for about 20 years. Ive even given it as a birthday cake and anniversary cake to loved ones. Dont let the small size fool you - this thing packs a wallop of flavor!  The breads are always consistently really good. This morning the Fantastic Mr. Its Complicated and I were in and he opted for a marble rye. A gorgeous perfect deceptively heavy super crusty rye. YUM!  I avoid the butter cookies as much as I can. Mostly because once I eat one I wont stop until theyre all gone. Yes I have eaten almost a full pound in one day. Not a pretty sight.  All the other cookies cakes mondelbread hamentaschen etc. are top notch too.  So nice to have a real old school kosher bakery in the hood!',4
'Have been wishing for a sushi bar in our neighborhood for a long long time (especially since Ayako/Akita-ya at The Biltmore closed) - never could have imagined one would open so close to our house and be this great. The sushi gods have blessed us!  Weve eaten here regularly since they opened and have never had a bad meal. In fact weve come to regard sushi chef Koji as a culinary genius (and would back him on Iron Chef any time!) Clever creations like Poki Chips and Tempura Mint Leaf are downright delicious and he makes the best sashimi and hand rolls weve ever had.  Whats best about Hana for us is that this is a neighborhood sushi bar - not a trendy hot spot . Focus here is on the food - and in just the right way. Not overdone like so many sushi spots with countless fancy rolls on the menu - and yet also not overly traditional like so many old-school sushi spots where they only offer standard nigiri and such (which can be quite good dont get me wrong but isnt it nice to add a little flavor and creativity too?)   Being a neighborhood spot Hana is quite small and can get crowded during peak hours. Theres a small dedicated staff here and when crowded service and food prep can be slow its only expected. We like to go later and sit at the sushi bar - to us thats always the best way to eat sushi anyway.',5
'Under construction when I visited today but still beautiful. Fellow botanical garden-ers were friendly.   Bottled water is not overpriced. At 1.50 a bottle it didnt sting that I forgot to bring my own water.  Park rangers are stern silently watching and protecting our pic-a-nik baskets from any impending doom.  Wear your best as there are tons of photographers running around. This could be your chance to get discovered - maybe your errant hand or part of your backpack will end up in some semi-famous hipsters Flickr!',5
'Low prices good food with good selection reasonably priced and served at all seats reserved seats if you want them good servers who work at staying out of the way clean new and nice but unpretentious. But maybe best of all they took out about half the seats in every theater and replaced them with large comfortable seats and snack bar seats with rolling chairs (also more comfortable than standard theater seats). Not a bad seat in the house. The kids love it I love it and my pocketbook is happy.',5
'I try not to write too much about chains but we came here for happy hour we we went too familiar with their menu and we kinda screwed up our order and got way too much food It was kind of a breakdown between customer and server but we had to bite the bullet on some of it and still pay for more than we ordered but they also helped out by knocking off a couple bucks and then giving us free apps the next time were in.',4
'Kind of stumbled into this place in a starving hung-over Ill settle for anything at this point state.  What can I say the best part of the experience was the mimosa...  The food was average but it did the job.  Great place to people watch and had a nice outdoor seating area.  I may give it another try when Im feeling 100% if I ever get back to Scottsdale!',3
'Guessing from going there and seeing the menu that this is a Chinese run Japanese restaurant.   The Atmostphere is pleasant with a upscale Scottsdale feel. The staff is very friendly but not overly friendly that they bug you and try to initiate conversation with you every chance they get.   We started out our order with Miso soup which at first glance looked liked the package miso soup you would get at a Japanese grocery store but with is quite tasty. Afterwards our orders for avocado roll unagi roll spicey tuna roll and my wifes beef chow fun came.  All the sushi was delicious and well prepped. The unagi roll was covered in a very potent Teriyaki sauce which I wonder how it will taste with chicken..perhaps next time.   My wife is a big fan of Beef Chow fun and enjoyed it.   Overall we were pleased with everything and will make an effort to come back and try other items on the menu.   HOWEVER!...I like to finish off at sushi places with green tea ice cream and they did not have it:(',4
'Im with Norma on the to-go option at Sweet Tomatoes.  I stopped by after Yelp Office Hours today and picked up a salad to go.  (I had planned on eating at Pane Bianco but they are closed on Monday - bummer!)  Actually for $8.22 it was a great deal!  I left with a huge salad a side of steamed veggies a cup of soup a sweet potato and an apple.  Now that is getting a bang for your buck!  Ive also eaten at other locations in the past and left feeling way too full because when you eat there you have to take advantage of everything including the fro yo bakery items and more...   I was impressed that the entire salad bar was kept clean and had many options to choose from.  I noticed for an additional fee you can also get a side of grilled chicken now.  I didnt need that though with so many other options.    I will not be a regular at Sweet Tomatoes anytime soon but for the right occasion especially when picking up to-go lunch it works.  Good thing I didnt read the other reviews on this location before I went or I probably wouldve spent double the $$ at AJs around the corner!',3
'I love this place. Everyone I know raves about it and every item I try is out of this world! I recommended it to a friend unfortunately he doesnt understand the appeal of fresh authentic ingredients and the rustic charm of the place. Hes missing out!',5
'Banana bread and their seasonal pumpkin bread are awesome. It doesnt hurt that they bake fresh bread everyday and that just tastes yummy everytime I get me some slices in the morn...',5
'This Starbucks recently opened and it has been quite the pleasure. Prior to this opening I was always having to wait in the long lines at the Starbucks at Arizona Ave and 202. Now that is one is open no more long lines! The best thing about this coffee shop is that the inside is HUGE! There is a lot of room for seating and there is a patio if one wishes to enjoy this beautiful March weather.   The staff is quite friendly (in fact they gave me a free coffee the other day) and are always attentive to your needs. There is a drive-thru if you dont wish to use your legs and Ive yet to wait more than 5 minutes to get my beverage :)',4
'We went to Sala Thai for my sisters birthday since she is a big fan of Thai food.  As for myself i could do without curry but will try not to let that influence my review.    When we got there there seemed to be plenty of seating and the waitress seemed quite accommodating.  We ordered a ton of food including Tom Yum souppad Thai pad Sui  curry chicken BBQ beef and pineapple fried rice.  Like I said earlier Im not a huge fan of curry but i did try some and I liked it more than I normally do.  I did not however try the Tom Yum soup just because I dont like it in general.  The pad Thai and pad Sui (spelling?) was OK  but I feel like Ive had better.  What I did love however was the pineapple fried rice and BBQ beef.  I could not get enough of it!  I almost finished the entire serving of fried rice by itself.    So to sum up my review if you are a fan of Thai food I think you will enjoy it a lot (my sister swears by it and spent a year in Thailand). However  Im just not a huge fan of Thai food and although they do offer a lot of neutral plates (BBQ plates come to mind) their specialty items I find are lacking.',3
'Ok... Im not from around these parts so maybe Im spoiled. But what happened to the fresh Krispy-Kreme experience? The hot donuts now sign? These things make Krispy-Kreme unique. Take em away and youre left with just a plain donut shop serving overpriced donuts. Luckily I was getting a dozen to go back to the condo where a quick trip through the microwave will restore these puppies to their former glory before being devoured by my donut deprived family. The donuts themselves are of a different texture than others but they are small so $10 for a dozen are truly a once in a great while experience.  I visited this shop at 8am on a Thursday and there was only one other person in the shop. The girl at the counter was ready to go & assembled my dozen quickly and with a smile. Overall the visit was good but I miss the old experience.',3
'Best fast food burger. Hands down. I would sacrifice 1000 fast food restaurants for a single location of in-n-out. Definitely a west coast bias here. Get a 4x4 with the fries animal style.',5
'Hey lets face the facts unless you are one of the people who seem to be insulated from the need for a recession style list of places to dine out. This friendly discount destination The Pizza Buffet can both please the pallet and feed you till full for less many folks spend every morning on a Standard Premium Latte. Rand H and I enjoyed all we could eat for $5 and change. Thanks again Rand for introducing me to another location on the buffet bounty!',4
'Ok Im Swedish by heritage so a love of IKEA is in my blood.  I just turned 30 in 2011 (play the funeral dirge) and up until recently this place has been my go to for years for inexpensive but euro-design modern furniture.  I say until recently because I find myself gravitating more now towards furniture that is heirloom quality.  The furniture in my place that comes from IKEA is now being phased out piece by piece via craigslist or Goodwill but Ill always have a soft spot in my heart (and my wallet!) for this place.  Ill still be pulling through here on occasion for the experience of walking through the well designed showroom and the good deals on housewares and lamps (which I do still think are worth it).  Oh and the food is surprisingly delish!  Get the Danish Wedding cake its awesome.  Dont be fooled by their terrible food photography!  (A meatball should not be photographed in the same fashion as a couch!)',4
'It is right across the street from where I work. Everyone is always so friendly and nice. The food has always been perfect and have amazing chocolate chip cookies. Its nice having a little local place such as this.',5
'3 or 4... 3 or 4.. 3 or 4.. ARG! Darn this thing for not having fractions. I knew this would be tough the minute I left this place.   I find myself in food ruts very often. I know that if I want Mexican food I can go to insert location here and leave a happy. Lately my life runs in big giant loops. I do the same things at the same times on the same days. Ive decided I need to branch somehow and food is what I landed on. Its a risky one because I dont get to indulge frequently. More often then not its a risk worth taking :)  I decided there had to be other really good old school Arizona Senoran Mexican food joints. This is phoenix the birth place of the burning hot plate molten cheese pooling greasy FREAKING AWESOME! I stumbled upon la pinata.. Home of the chimichanga since 1970 now thats old school. I did what I always do when I run into something that claims to have been around since the dawn of time in phoenix. I emailed my Dad and Uncle and asked them about it. The whole family loves Mexican and if its been around and was decent they had to have been here.  Been around forever.. used to go there a few times a week.. dont make it to that area much anymore..  This is a good sign. I gathered a small group and got it in my mind that I was going to try one of each of the staples: cheese crisp guacamole taco enchilada relleno tamale  We would go here and split this then head over to Los Compadres and do the same. Never made it to #2 as the cheese and grease (not complaining) won over my will to continue.  Food:  chips hot/mild salsa: The chips were great! Nice and crispy.. no hint of stale or greasy. Really the perfect chip in my mind. The salsa was also delicious. Was very fresh and heavy on the cilantro. It actually had some kick/spice to it. I was actually surprised how much heat it had and that most of the gringos werent complaining about it. For me nothing is to hot. Also really liked their hot sauce which was the normal pureed red chili garlic Mexican oregano variety but had no bitterness. Good stuff!  cheese crisp: Ahhhh the cheese crisp. A magical thing made or two ingredients that somehow can be worlds different everywhere you go. This one was great! The cheese blend was excellent. It was the right combination of crispy/fold-able. Some people like them super crunchy.. Im not one of those people. I like it right in the middle. Fold-ability is important for mass salsa guacamole storage :) If its to crispy it just crumbles and you have salsa and grease all over your hands plate and face. It is kind of sexy for a foodie. But you dont want a date seeing you like this. Some places really mess these up.. or even worse! fold the damn things over and still call them cheese crisps.. This is a quesadilla! not the same thing. You serve me a quesadilla when I order a cheese crisp and theres gonna be trouble.  guacamole: Another place in the valley that knows what guacamole should be. Avocado Lime Lemon Garlic Green Onion and Salt. Maybe a little cilantro and some small amount of pepper(serrano) for heat. None of this giant pieces of tomato and white onion nonsense. Some people love it when they ruin guac like this oh it tastes so fresh! Bad news people it makes it taste like tomatoes and onions nothing but a filer knocking down the production cost which I assure you is not passed down to you ;)  shredded beef taco: I actually like this one better then carlos obriens. The meat is still very tasty and I believe the shell is fried with the meat inside. It had zero soggy effect You know what Im taking about one or two bites before the bottom falls out and you finish it on your plate with a fork and knife. Its still tasty when this happens its kind of like the cheese crisp mess its not pretty. This was darn good but I still like the ones at Manuels better.  green corn tamale: I cant judge this well as I dont eat these very often. It was nice and moist and had a good texture. It seemed like it might be a little overly sweet to me.  chile relleno:  Decent. I liked the batter but the chile was to mild and their green sauce is lacking. Best ones Ive ever had were at a place called the friendly dolphin in rocky point Mexico.  cheese enchilada: I really like their cheese blend so it was hard not to like the enchilada. The corn tortilla was good. Was not a fan of the red sauce.  Red/Green Sauce: I wasnt in love with the red or the green sauce. It wasnt horrible but far far farrrr from the best in the valley. Since this covers 90% of all Mexican food this is why this place isnt getting a higher rating.  Cons: Very pricey! a taco tamale enchilada rice and beans combo is 12.95. Cheese crisp with a side of guacamole 7.50!  Service was 3 out of 5. Felt neglected at times.',3
'Good prices but this please is honestly not worth the hassle. First of all you have to leave your purse at the counter. I am not comfortable doing that anywhere. Who does that? The only place I have ever seen this before was ASUs bookstore.   Then you walk in this warehouse that has NO air conditioning!!! I made the mistake of going yesterday in the middle of the day (111 degrees out yikes!) Then you get inside and you have to carry a catalog to refer to for prices since items are unmarked in large boxes.   If they had a/c it would have been worth it to save a few bucks on the toys my dog destroys in minutes but no air conditioning??? IN ARIZONA?? Madness!',1
'This unlikely little club is considered to be one of the best places in the Valley to catch local bands. Its hard to believe this place is in sleepy Mesa!  The food is good and the selection is HUGE: Pizza Calzones sandwiches Gyros subs burgers steaks and Mexican food. Watch out though-- cheap drinks and live music can make this place a madhouse!',4
'Crispy fish tacos! Hot salsa that is actually pretty hot. Nice clean salsa bar nice clean restaurant. Service was a tad slower than on past visits but everything was fresh clean and crisp.   I highly recommend the new avocado corn tacos! Ultra tasty.  Also glad they went back to battering their own Original tacos! Sad to see the Mahi Mahi go away but it got replaced by Ono so next visit Ill try those grilled AND blackened - cuz thats how I used to enjoy the Mahi.   Things I can complain about on this visit are:  People need to learn to ROLL limes before slicing them...otherwise getting the juice outta them is pretty unlikely without using the death grip that always ends with the juice right in yer eye! Prices have gone up a bit...I understand fuel costs and all that but three bucks a taco is getting pricey. However Id rather the prices stay as high as they are rather than have freshness and quality suffer.',4
'Food City has the absolute BEST prices on produce that Ive ever seen anywhere in AZ CA or HI. When I first saw the Wednesday circular advertising avocados 5/$.99 and 8 lbs. of roma tomatoes for $.99 I knew that there had to be a catch. I scurried down to Avondale as fast as my little honda could take me and alas the ad was real and I scored 4 massive bags of produce for a whopping.... $12. You have to buy whats on sale and I havent bought much here other than produce as I dont find their grocery prices to be outstanding but for fruits and veggies theres no better place IMHO.   As an added bonus with all of the Mexican music playing throughout the store Im learning a little bit of Spanish. Ole!',4
'It is just dismal those few times you want something to eat at the coffee house and your choices are sad breakfast offerings or overpriced bakery items.  But I am vouching for Steves food!... bacon jalepeno & cheese frittata (w/ thin sliced potatoes as the bottom layer) as well as the ham & cheese stuffed brioche!  You do have to heat yourself.. luckily the microwave does have power settings so go PL-7 or 8 to avoid overcooking as you heat.    These guys are open early (5:30am M-F and 6:30am S-S)... so this is going to be my new go to place to grab some food when I have an early morning  flight or roadtrip.',4
'I drive by this location on the weekends and there is always a line! This morning B and I wanted to have omelets somewhere and it was before 7:30am so we went here. Not spectacular but the place is clean the staff is friendly service was quick and the food was good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the coffee is weak and they charge almost $3.00 a cup. We will probably go again when the mood strikes.',4
'This is definitely a clubbers club.  Music bumpin and people getting down on the floor - literally almost (wink)  They have great special events (thanks Phillip!) - way to bring the techno loving peeps together!  Glow sticks blacklighting and even my pimp cup was glow in the dark :)  Painted models and Go Go dancers is always a plus.  One more shot please and make it sweet! :)  However this place wasnt what it used to be.  I remember seeing lines of people including me waiting just to walk across the street :( Hopefully things start to change - enjoy!',3
'A great place great uniforms great attitudes good food.  Its tops in the market segment of well the market segment of Hooters and Tilted Kilt.  Really Tilted Kilt is far better.  The garlic fries Im sure slapped 2 pounds on my waistline but were fantastic.  All the gals working - whatever their stage names - were positive and helped run food and provide good service.  The food was consistent over a few days too.',5
'this place is right by my place so its an easy quick run to grab a bite. the food is good however not that authentic.... real mexican food doesnt call for cheddar cheese on enchiladas. very americanized food. still good though.',3
'Love that they are all organic and everything was reasonably priced.  The food came out quick and was very good.  The customer service was excellent! I definitely recommend this place!',4
'Short one...   Really fun Characters are fantastic. Definitely see the gun shoot out and the old time photos are worth the kinda expensive price. good time for all ages.',5
'This is an awesome breakfast spot.  Never have a problem getting a table-usually opt for the bar tables.  The veggie omelets are great and loooove the rosemary potatoes.  They are not the ordinary breakfast potatoes that everyone else serves.  The eggs bene may be in my top 3 for best bene EVER!  Also great breakfast burritos!  Full bar is a great plus but was disappointed by the bloody mary.  The mix may have been bad.  All in all love this place!!  Ask for specials not on the menu-the ribeye steak and eggs was a great quality meal for the price (12 or 13 bucks).    The guy server that makes the foil roses is one of the best servers.  In fact all the male servers have always provided great service-unfortunately not so much with the female servers ive had.  The last time it was a girl and she was nice but very unattentive.',4
'This is such a tough call. The food is really really good. The actual restaurant itself is below par. That said here ya go ---  Stopped in for a quick dinner with the family. The first thing that we notice is that the place is fairly rundown. The second thing we notice is that the AC does not work very well. It was really hot in the place.   We decided what the heck we are already here lets eat. We ordered pot stickers hot and sour soup garlic chicken chicken fried rice sweet and sour chicken and mu shu pork. I have to say that I was quite surprised. The food was delicious! The pot stickers were crisp and fresh. The sweet and sour was darn good as well. Light batter. Not overly sweet.  Couple of additional thoughts - We had the kids with us so it was pretty standard fare; however the menu actually has some interesting looking items on it. Lastly I think the food is worth it but I think I would go for take out next time.   N*joy',3
'I am obsessed with their Acai smoothie. Their store is bright colorful and smell of oranges it always puts me in a good mood and everyone is always super-friendly.',5
'I need to update my review of Blue Fin. This place absolutely rocks; thats probably why you can find me eating lunch here 4 out of 5 weekdays seriously. I havent ever had a bad experience here after finding this gem and cannot speak higher of everything about they provide. Service quality and freshness of food as well as value cannot be found elsewhere.',5
'This place is amazing. Staff is always nice. Not much more I need to say!',5
'Messy set up- thought I was in line to be seated... no I was in line for the baby stroller drop off.  After getting out of that clearly unmarked line I stepped into the actual wait to be seated line.  The waiters and waitresses were dressed in safari gear which fit with the rain forest theme.  The restaurant is dimmed  so you can see the small star display on the ceiling and the trees are lit up with fish tanks randomly placed around the interior.  Personally I thought the menu was very over priced for the generic food that was served. I tried to play it safe with a cheese burger and chips and that ended up to be $15.00.  Burger was dry and the bun was greasy.  The chips were tasty though kettle cooked.    I had my hopes on going to this establishment but I just wasnt pleased. I think more exotic food items and semi lower prices or even a happy hour sort or menu would be a great idea.',1
'I highly recommend Greg and his staff at British Auto. They have taken great care of  our cars over the years. They have always been more than willing to go out of their way to explain the work and associated cost of the repairs. Unlike the dealers when there is a problem they do not go and replace every single part that could be remotely related to the problem at great expense. They actually take the time to identify the problem and correct it. I know I have literally saved thousands of dollars compared to what I used to spend elsewhere. That being said Jaguars are still complex vehicles that are not inexpensive to maintain. Unfortunately some people dont  understand this complain and probably should be driving an old Toyota instead of a Jag',5
'I was a guest of one of the VIPs during the recent Center Stage event showcasing 4 bands and a selected dinner/drink menu. Our seats were directly stage right and we had a great view of the bands that performed throughout the night - all were very very talented and entertaining.  I hear they play through the week so I will defiantly return based on the band selection alone. The pre selected menu was quite impressive. Our starter was the antipasti which was loaded with a selection of cheese olives fig chutney apricot puree grilled asparagus and a mini mound of prosciutto and capicolla - severed with perfectly crisp bread. Seriously a meal on its own.  Our next item was the spicy tuna roll. We had a repeat order on this item or I should admit I had a repeat order.  I ate most of our shared order and the additional round. I love Sushi and this was pretty good sushi. I hear the newly installed sushi bar is quite the hit. Ill be back for that too.  My drink selection for the evening was the prickly pear margarita. I indulged just a tad if you can call 8 rounds a tad. Yup they were that good.   We enjoyed a stroll throughout the property post entertainment dinner and drinks and I was impressed with the layout of the property and the many resort/spa options. Hey lookey there A Gondola Ride!!!!! Gotta try that when the weather cools down for sure.  Getting that guided tour sure made me feel like an A-lister or it could have been all the margaritas. As such my plans on my next staycation are in the works.',4
'I went to Athletes Performance as an outside consult. They greeted me with open arms and treated me very well. The reason for my visit was to see one of their sport nutritionists. I met with Michelle on two different occasions and exchanged many e-mails with her. She took the time to evaluate my current eating habits reviewed all my supplements and vitamins and set up a meal plan based on my specific body type and goals. In the long run based on her recommendations I will actually end up saving money. For anyone who is curious how they can tweak or build a meal plan based on their own personal goals I highly recommend scheduling an appointment. At the time of my visit it was only $250 for the two appointments. She also offered to assist me through e-mail with any questions I have in the future. In the end I was completely satisfied with my visit to Athletes Performance my only wish is that I could afford to actually work out there. The facilities and staff they have are simply amazing. If you have the resources you wont be disappointed. Thanks again Michelle for all your hard work I really appreciated it and Im on my way to meeting my goals.',5
'I mean they just do it right.  Everything from their service to the quality of the food to the bathrooms to the piano music to their professionalism its just spot on.  I have been frequenting My Florist for several years.  They were one of the first places that started to change the way I felt about Phoenix....  They sort of teetered the totter that was heavily leaning in the direction of the people are losing the fight in Phoenix.  Corporate takeover is assured.  Breath of fresh air to walk in and see a lot of the same wait staff that has been there for several years.  That says a lot.    The food is delicious.  Very fresh.  Very artisan far from run of the mill but still simple and not overly ridiculous.  The portions are large.  Large sandwiches enormous delicious salads.  The servers are full of fabulous suggestions and their daily specials are amazing.    Ive been there many times and I dont think my beverage has ever gotten empty without being offered a refill and they have never failed to check back with me to see how everything tastes.  I always tip extremely well here because it is deserved.  In fact I randomly ran into one of the servers at another establishment and he just couldnt think of where he knew me from (me either) and then his eyes got bright and he said Oh wait!  you come into My Florist!  Youre a great tipper!.  So next time you are pondering whether or not to leave the extra coupla dollars (cmon you know youll just blow it on something stupid) leave it for your server when provided with great service.  My Florist is a place that recognizes their fan-base and consistenly comes through.    I recommend the brie salad the turkey and brie sandwich and any of their soups.  Yes I like brie.  Its freakin delicious okay.',5
'Ok. This place is THE BEST place to get sausages in Phoenix PERIOD! The breakfast sausage could very well best the best ever. I go here regularly and have had so many of thier sausages they have all been great. I do not even buy supermarket sausage anymore after finding this place not even in the same ball park. Top notch.',5
'This place is a hidden little jewel that apparently only locals know about. Since I am now a local I know too. Amazing is the only word I can think of. All fresh ingredient and made with love. I had the house made Margarita with no refined sugar at all. Just Tequila and fresh citrus. Thats it! Then leeks with fresh mozzarella bread crumbs and egg on top. Also rock shrimp razor clams and cheese plate. Wow!  So European and yummy.',5
'The mixed basket of sweet potato and regular fries with the assorted dipping sauces is awesome. The hamburgers on the other hand leave something to be desired. First of all if you want your beef cooked medium you have to order medium well. They always undercook the meet and Ive yet to have a hamburger that really excited my taste buds. However the beers on tap selection is pretty good and theres never a very long wait.',3
'my friends and I went here for the first time last night and we were VERY happy! Their happy hour menu is fantastic! we got the philly roll crazy boy spicy tuna tempura and shrimp tempura. They were all really delicious and had sooo much flavor. This place blew RA out of the water.  the location is eh but the sushi is FAB!   the staff was really nice. I asked for extra ginger and boy they werent stingy at all! Oh and their prices are great!  Thank goodness we found this place because Im a fan and will be back. NO MORE KOI for meeeeee :) YAYERRR!!!',4
'I have to say this did not disappoint.  Both out of town buddy and I were very impressed by the service the presentation and the taste.  I had the salmon that was pretty darn good. But when you ask if the salmon is wild and the server says uhh well its sustainable.  Yeah. That means farmed. I dont care if its from Scotland its farmed  and at this time of year get fresh northwest or Alaskan salmon from the pacific.  Wild. I get it at Frys .  I would certainly recommend to others.  Not very busy but food  out quickly and hot.  Give it a try if youre in Scottsdale     I will be back for sure. Again staff was great and attentive.  If you want to walk out stuffed go to a dump like red lobster. Support local restaurants   My bro said his salad and scallops were great  so really I would make it a 4.5 if I could',4
'Fun Irish pub with live music. The name means fun laughter and a lively party. Great service and cool bar. The place was designed and built in Ireland and was shipped to Arizona.',3
'I was delighted to find this genuine deli serving delicious authentic food. It is an oasis in a land of franchises. Corned beef on rye and lox with cream cheese on bagel were soul satisfying. If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular!',4
'This was our first hotel stop on our cross-country road trip.  The staff was pleasant and standard for a Ritz Carlton hotel however the hotel was nothing special for a Ritz Carlton.  This was more like a business Ritz versus a special celebration or resort Ritz.    They remembered my sisters birthday with slices of chocolate cake waiting for us in our room however the outdoor pool was small the steam room was not on or ready in the morning and the extra amenities were not provided and only available upon request.  Passing through this was an acceptable hotel however I would not go out of my way to stay here... unless I was in Phoenix.',4
'I love good food this includes pizza and I find that Im a pizza/food agnostic/nazi. Chicago deep dish pie style crispy new york style... theres something good in all of them. Rustic or high tech I enjoy it all. I just cant stand thoughless preparation of meals that would be the Hard liner in me. Not to worry Grimaldis delivers in every way that matters! From entering on a Sunday evening everyone was honestly warm in their greeting chatting about the day etc.  From the tea which was perfect (Mine basic non-sweetened and The Brides Passion fruit wonderfulness both were simple basic and perfect for the meal) Both of us were expecting leftovers so we opted for a small salad each knowing that the portions were huge I just wanted a Greek style salad while the Bride had zero desire for feta/olives etc so opted for a house salad. So two small *SNORT SMALL!* salads were brought to out table... sheesh! Not so much small as only a buffet on a plate!  My Medeteranion salad was very good I admit it was blander than I like Lots of feta (YAY) however I had asked for extra and they sure delivered! Strangely enough the feta was blander than Im used to which caught me by surprise. Still creamy and tart very welcome indeed.  Also No onions on the salad? Im sure it was an over site next time Ill ask for extra onions (a silly for onions!)  Or a different salad I tried The Brides house salad and the flavors were a wonderful balance the roasted peppers really added a lot of flavors.. smoky/sweet just wonderfully clean and fresh. On   And then.. to the pizza. So pretty! Its so rare that you look at a lowly pizza and see the level of care that went into its construction. We opted for a classic first time benchmark. Pepperoni sausage onions with fresh garlic. I usually avoid garlic but The Bride wanted it and since it was fresh and not garlic powder I was open to it. The garlic was quite good however it wasnt really needed on the pie.The fresh basil which tasted fresh from the garden was lovely and I would order more of that instead of garlic next time. (and possibly meatballs). The crust was this with a good chew. Mozzarella cheese was fresh and NOTHING like the shredded crap you can get at Costco etc.  You can tell the placing of the toppings was done with care evenly dispensed but not uniform  It was without a doubt the best sausage Ive had in decades. And the pepperoni was flavorful although the thick cut did make the texture a tad different Im told it was a slicer issue and not the usual preparation method.    We had a great chat with our server about the restaurant and how its been going over also Jennifer who seems to be a manager came over and chatted for a bit very nice laid back and fun.   If your in a hurry and planning a eary dinner late lunch I recommend calling first since the charcoal over requires cheaning once during the day and its unable to cook for around a hour or so so you might want to avoid that period. Also as a earlier Yelper commented they do not use gloves when making crust as someone who was a cook in my youth Im amazed I mean making a pizza with rubber gloves? Talk about overkill and a pain in the rear! Your trusting them to touch your food in other ways i dont see the issue. Also the oven gets to 1000% so Im not worried about anything nasty making it out of there if anything I dont want the flavor of melted plastic on my Za! (and Im not such a germaphobe that I fear chefs touching my food if I wanted a conveyor belt style meal.. no shortage of options around here.   Pro: Great classic New York pizza epic portions extraordinary pride taken in providing a premium product. with quick efficient good natured prideful service. Passion fruit tea was the best Ive ever had.  And We were informed by Jennifer (a manager of some sort i gather) that you can order your pizza like a steak. rare medium rare medium medium well well done.... all giving different levels of crunch to the dough and toppings etc.  Next time we are going to try playing with that aspect... perhaps some extra cheese and go medium or medium well? Get a tad more of the charcoal crustiness to it.  Con: Limited menu I know that a place like this would make a killer meatball & Spagetti or sandwich! I appreciate the total focus on making the perfect pie... but when the farthest afield they go is a Calzone .. well they are almost rainman level focused! (take it  thats a complement Im just greedy I admit it. The meditiranian salad was blander than expected. They use the same dressing for this salad as for the house salad. Yes feta helps but some peperoncini and Greek dressing would be nice. Next time Ill either try the Cesare or antipasto or skip that course. (And a little bread just pizza dough with s with the salad would be nice). Gimmick or not the water tastes great! Almost worth not getting a drink and enjoying the delicious aqua!',5
'Always a treat. Family owned and its been the same people for as long as I can remember. Their food is tasty and is perfect for a quick bite or for watching any sporting event at the house. The pizza and wings special is delicious. Best way to order their pizza/wings is well-done. Great sandwiches too. Ive witnessed them cleaning every inch of the kitchen area on multiple occasions even as far behind major appliances as they can go on a nightly basis.',5
'Great food totally worth the extra few bucks you would save some where else.   The restaurant is located on the bottom floor of an office building and unless you were looking for it you would probably drive right past it. The prices on the menu can be a bit off putting but I would say worth it if you enjoy a good meal.   As an appetizer we shared fried avocado for no other reason than to try it. It came topped with fresh crab meat the avocado is coated with an egg wash and then rolled in bread crumbs before its fried to produce a delightful this crust. I would definitely order that again.   I had the sugar cured duck breast and my girlfriend had the bacon wrapped pork sirloin. I love duck and this one was very tasty this particular piece had more fat on it than usual but no complaints. The cure cured skin was crispy and sweet. The tenderloin melted in our mouths so ridiculously good.',4
'Thanks to Liz S for giving me the heads up on a Groupon for Circle 6 a few months ago!  My husband and I took took the beginners class which was a great introduction to the process.  The class was really designed to allow you to see if youre interested in moving forward with future classes.  Although we didnt get to work with color in this particular class the instructors safely guided us through the steps to make our own glass flowers.  Although it was a group class we made our flowers one at a time so we each had the complete attention of the instructors.  I was a little nervous I might put someones eye out with my stick of molten glass but everyone left in one unburned piece.  You will have to pick up your flowers at a later date at their studio on Roosevelt.  Surrounded by beautiful creations the studio is a great place to see that your flower is not really that great and you will need more classes!',5
'A rock hit my windshield on my way to work last week.  I called my service advisor at Acura North Scottsdale who referred me to Penske Rapid Repair.  They handled all of the insurance paperwork and replaced my windshield AT MY OFFICE later that same day.  Excellent work and great service.  I highly recommend them.',5
'Chips were pretty good thin and crispy served with three different kinds of salsa. Tried the baja shimp burrito could possibly be the best thing Ive ever had at a Mexican restaraunt!!! So much flavor and generously stuffed with shrimp',4
'Tons of TVs & a good menu of bar food. We went here to watch a NW college football game and eat/drink before the Territorial Cup at ASU. The draft beer selection is just okay but there are a ton of TVs so you can get whatever game you want on a conveniently placed screen. As a California native Im always a little weirded out by bars imitating a California beach bar outside of California like Tavern on Mill but at least this bar supports the Chargers. The crowd at the bar seemed full of tools & bro hos but Im not sure if thats the bar or if thats just the ASU football game crowd. The place was practically empty when we got there around 1 pm but completely full by 5:30 (7:30 ASU-AZ game). I had:  - Spicy Caesar Salad: Decently fresh but rather small. The menu doesnt say it but the salad comes with a mini quesadilla which was a nice addition. I thought the dressing was yucky and would recommend just using some salsa instead. - Taco: I subbed black beans in for the meat and overall it was a good taco. Nothing special but not bad either. It comes with unremarkable chips - Mozzarella Sticks: Normal mozzarella sticks with good marinara sauce. If youre looking for an app to share I would recommend the nachos instead. - Tater Tots: Love bars that have tater tots because they are never bad.',3
'I totally LOVE this place. Every time we have been here the employees have been incredibly nice helpful and knowledgable. Their selection is awesome too and they have reasonable prices. We mainly come here for dog bones and toys and we have never been disappointed! I highly recommend this store for their selection and friendly staff : )',5
'I took fellow yelpers recs and ordered naan and bengun bhartha while my bf ordered chicken korma. It was all incredible! Ive been apprehensive about Indian food after a couple bad experiences 10+ years ago but Tandoori Times has changed my perspective 180 degrees! I cannot wait to go back! Plus a majority of the customers tonight were South Asian Indians so you know its truly good Indian cuisine.',5
'Ok my friends have been pushing me to check this place out for a while for sure.  I complain all the time about wanting to find a decent cheesesteak.  I admit I spend far more time in downtown Phoenix or Arcadia than I do Oldtown Scottsdale but the other weekend I was in the are so some friends and I popped by for a cheesesteak.  This place is cool.  HUZZAH! for having both cheese wiz and white american I love both on cheesesteaks and thats always a positive sign.  The food was great!  Still not South Street but close enough.  This place is 24 hours as well!  Still trying to convince someone to have a cheesesteak brunch haha.',4
'Good prices for gas ice cold drinks plenty of quick snacks and easy to get in and out of from Grand Ave.',4
'Really huge menu...  breakfast lunch and more.  The bagels are pretty good.  Way better than anyplace else I have been in Phoenix.',3
'Love the Louisiana-style fried oysters here (#14) - eight plump juicy molluscs in cornmeal batter deep-fried to perfection. I ordered fries and slaw as sides; fries were good the slaw was just OK. The hush puppies that came with the order were on the dense side. Im definitely coming back to try the fish and other tempting items on the menu.',4
'Resturants in strip malls are deceiving... that is why i searched for pizza on yelp before I just went out to another pizza place and be disappointed. This resturant was in a strip mall and I wouldnt have stopped if I was just driving past it. I found in on Yelp and decided to go for a nice quiet date night and it was perfect! I was definately go back here again to take family friends visiting another night out. Cute inside and outside I was very pleased with the pizza as well. I got the proscutto pizza and it was very yummy. 4 stars!',4
'I love Panda Express but this location is starting to piss me off.  I have no problem with the food or the indoor experience.  My biggest problem is with the drive thru.  Ive probably gone through the drive-thru around 20 times and I would say at least 8 times my order was wrong.  Most of the time I get the wrong type of chicken on my 2 entree plate although the ordering screen shows exactly what I ordered.  Its beyond maddening at this point.  Ill just have to go in every time or just stop going there at all.  Just happened today (4/28) which lead me to post this.',2
'Wonderful Indian food!  The best food and service.  Give it a try and you will not be disappointed.  5 stars!',5
'Only had an order of french fries before my flight and they were really great. Not overly greasy and cooked to my liking. Crisp on the outside fluffy on the inside.   Staff was super busy so you need to get their attention but they are helpful once they are taking your order.   Enough seating to accommodate everyone when I was there but it seems to fill up.',4
'Went back with a couple of girl buddies.(yes I gave in even when I said I wouldnt); seated on the patio service excellent as before food much better this time around but stuck with lunch stuff.',4
'Tom Thumbs Campfire Bistro tacos were the best thing at Yelps Western Adventure!  Other than the Tequila Bus :-)  Ive been to Tom Thumb and eaten at Campfire many times.  Their Yelp event was great fun too.  This morning we took the kids for gingerbread house building event they had.  Terrific as always.',5
'Delicious quick and fresh food. Comfortable atmosphere in a good location. Food was excellent and brought out to us about 2 minutes after we sat down. Will definitely dine again!',5
'Only things to order: Jewish Sliders & Matzah Ball Soup  Seriously the other stuff on the menu is just decent...the two items above are what we one for.',4
'Nice little find for casual sushi',4
'Good.  God.  Scoop of chocolate gelato in a cup of espresso. I cant stop craving it.',5
'if you are MSG sensitive stay clear of this place. I havent been here in 2 + years ever since my last experience.  like most reviews the pizza is so so...more along the lines of grocery store pizza....the music is wonderful. Like a previous poster said the ordering process and the lack of credit card acceptance (or lack thereof)is a huge drawback',2
'I have wanted to eat here for some time and finally did so today. It was a long but fast moving line of those with sausages ordering to eat the same. If you a young lady on the prowl this is the place for you. The all beef dog was perfect!!!! The cheese fries were yummy.  All for less than seven bucks. A great lunch. I plan on going back on Monday for a brat.',5
'Great pizza with fresh ingredients.  But no wood-oven taste as they claimed and the prices are a little on the high side for freshly made pizza.  Great service from our server kind of made up for an overpriced appetizer of olive oil and bread.',3
'Well Im not from Tempe or the Desert or Buffalo at all and I LOVE TEDS! Ive lived and traveled all across our country Canada and Mexico and the dogs at Teds are about the best. Coming a close 2nd is the Texas Hot Lunch in Hanover Pennsyltucky near Gettysburg. Cooked over a flame right in front of you I usually get a All Beef  (or 2) with chili & cheese and crispy fries made the same way. Their chili is so tasty it makes you want to send to a chemist to get the recipe. The rushs run at different times too so be prepared to wait for your dog its worth it. Oh and as mentioned bring cash although there is a Bank of America ATM in the same parking lot.',5
'YCs is just so tasty!  I have been going to YCs for over a decade and Ive never had a bad expierience. love the idea of mongolian grill in general but what is great about YCs compared to a lot of other mongolian grills is that the sauces are on the lighter side and everything is always fresh.  You basically make it yourself - so it is hard to go wrong!',4
'Ive been to a couple of shows at the lost leaf and each time I enjoyed myself The service is always very welcoming and friendly It is a cute little house with a cool layout They even have a small side patio where you can enjoy the weather or enjoy a cigarette They also have a great beer selection I always ponder where they put their beer... Like its a small house... With a ton of beer.. I always just see the fridge though lol I had a pumpkin ale one night and I loved it The guys behind the bar are very helpful',4
'Had my first experience here yesterday and the first thing I noticed was that everyone seemed to be enjoying their job. The folks behind the line were chatting and smiling (with each other and customers)  while working as fast as the wind! (two things you rarely see happen at the same time) Being a first timer the fellow taking my order helped me out a bit We went for a #5 Vito (Italian)  #9 Italian Night Club  and a Gargantuan (tons of different meats all double amount its 2-3 meals in one bun!)   What distinguishes JJ to me is that everything tastes so fresh. The meats and cheese taste like they were just sliced not sliced days before and vacuum packed.  And I know the bread at Subway is baked fresh but this bread just tastes fresher and better. I thought I would miss the extra flavors and such subway offers but I didnt. Quality ingredients really shined through.  I had them put extra vinaigrette and hot peppers (not really that hot) to add a little depth of flavor and it was far from over soggy but worked out just right. Is this the best sub Ive ever had in my life? Nope but at a average of $6 apiece its a surprise and best Bang For Buck sub Ive ever had. And it IS one of the freshest tasting subs Ive had in recent memory. They also will deliver just one sub most places have a $10 minimum how refreshing is that? As to complaints about the music I found the music to be no louder than most places. Quieter than 5 Guys MUCH louder than Village Inn.',5
'Having recently moved to the Phoenix area after living in the same area in the NW for years I now need to find health care providers for both myself and my dog.  That can be very stressful and I want to make vet visits for her to be as stress free as possible.    I Yelped vets in the Avondale area and Goodyear Animal Hospital had great ratings so I called on Friday to make an appointment as my girl needed to get updated on her vaccinations.  I thought I would need to wait several days or even have to wait for a week until I was completely free NEXT weekend.  No my appointment was for the very next day (yesterday).   Everyone that we dealt with were awesome.  My girl is a little leery of new people and environments and they quickly made her feel comfortable and they answered all my questions and discussed the differences in environment between here and the NW and what we should be watching for and the reason for why a different vaccination schedule.  Goodyear Animal Hospital is awesome and Minas new health care provider.  :)',5
'we stop for a great pizza. day before new years our waiter Lori was too busy but still very attentive. Pizza was best yet. thin crust baked perfect crust tender and fresh. Best Pizza In Arizona.  Thats why we always go back. Never disappointed',4
'Good place for dinner/lunch. Service is great!',4
'Its funny reading down these reviews I really dont have much to add. I think its best summed up by Nicki H. Starting with bubbly and moving into a nice red you will never go wrong at Atlas. Hey even if you do want that white its only 20 feet away!   Definitely call ahead.   Seriously pound for pound and what you get for your money it is the best date spot in Scottsdale. You feel exclusive in small space which is a turn on to most. I say go immediately or as soon as you can get a reservation.',5
'I didnt  go for the great salad bar or even the best dinner rolls I have  ever had. We went for the steak....every one of the options(over 10) were fantastic. The fact that you get to try as many and as much as youd like makes it great.  No this isnt a buffet like it  sounds. GO hungry and leave happyperiod.',5
'neh.  nothing special 2 me.  they have a good beer selection and many different pasties.  thats about it.  not so awesome service and i was told that the waitress was their regular waitress hilarious.    if u like stuff wrapped in pie dough and baked go 4 it.  this stuff is too dry 4 me but i do know sum people who like comin here 2 drink their huge cups of beer and eat pasties (that prob only taste decent cuz theyre gettin tipsy).',2
'Store is beautiful and the employees are very helpful!',5
'Average fast soup salad and sandwich place. Really love that they give you a chocolate covered strawberry with every purchase. I like their variety of items. Love the lobster bisque and all the paninis. Love the mangoberry salad because I love fruit in my salad. It gives it more substance and mangos are yummy. Definitely better than Paradise Bakery. Plus everyone is always so nice.',4
'Wow! This charming restaurant is just what Phx needs! A food and wine lovers homerun with great attention to detail every where you look. The staff from front to back was spot on and makes you feel like a regular customer on your first visit! What started off with a quick beer at the bar while waiting for a walk in table turned into a charming and elegant dinner with our own personal dining experience at the bar with a great foody/bartender  who took us on our Beckets journey! I HIGHLY recommend Becketts Table with only one reservation... I would hate for it to get so popular that I couldnt get right in!   Thank you for delighting my taste buds!   Brook',5
'My co-workers and I went her after work one day. It was a really friendly place. We were welcomed by the bartenders and they kept the drinks coming.   -The Happy Hour Specials were great I ordered one of every appitizer. The hummus was delicious and for a bar I was shocked. -The drinks were well made and not too over powering but enough I had to stop way in advance of driving home.  -The bartenders were attentive if I had an empty drink glass in front of me they were all about what to get me next. -The locals were friendly but not overly friendly. I have to say I appreciated that. I didnt feel like an outcast however I didnt feel like I needed to leave and bleach myself in Clorox.  I would certainly recommend this place for happy hour after work or just relaxing on the weekends. It seems like the place to be for the area!',4
'what i havnt reviewed this place yet wtf great decorservicefood we live in ne mesa and trek the 30 miles or so to have breakfast here on sundays kevin the owner is almost always here he runs a tight ship and always greets us with a big hello.I will say it is one of the  great pubs/restaurants in phx.',4
'I havent been to PV mall for many years since moving to north Scottsdale so it was a surprise to see how run down the place is. The final straw for me was watching as a young man shook down a shopper in Dillards for bus fare.  Yes panhandling in the main aisle in Dillards but even more impressive was overhearing one of the salespeople explain to another salesperson how it happens all the time and management doesnt do anything about it. I walked out of the store looking over my shoulder thinking the panhandler was following me out after having made eye contact with him and seeing him do a quick turnabout in my direction. Who needs that shit. I will never go back to PV Mall....it IS the new Christown!  Shame on you Dillards management!',1
'Let me preface this by saying that I moved from Austin TX last year. As such... mexican or tex-mex restaurants are not something I am used to. Hole in the walls run by moms and pops? Yes. PLEASE. Somehow those are just vastly BETTER.  That said El Encanto is turning out some decent food. Not great. Not bad. Just decent. The mole is probably some of the best I have tasted (what IS that flavor to it that I have never had in mole before?). The enchiladas arent spectacular but then again... theyre enchiladas. I like em. Pollo Fundido? I guess Im in the minority with that one as I barely touched it. The chicken wasnt the least bit tender and chowing down on poultry a few feet away from some ducks swans and random birds wasnt exactly a rocking experience.  Having said that the pond and its denizens does provide for some nice atmosphere. Go at night around dinner. In the summer it cools off enough and in the winter the patio is heated. Just make sure to guard the complimentary salsa and chips off hours or you will have some competition for them.  In my visits service has always been A+ though.  My main gripe... the margaritas. People think these are good!? For the price Im paying I at least expect to taste SOMETHING. Ive ordered them enough times now to know theyre consistently weak and mostly ice. Hell to the no. Never again.  All in all El Encanto is a good enough place to go when in Cave Creek and in need of some americanized Mexican food.',3
'Tried it out today & have found a new neighborhood favorite...fun place...nice people & great food!',5
'The next stop on my quest to try the Hot on Yelp top 5 landed me at China King.    Im a big fan of dim-sum so to get 5 stars out of me you really have to knock me off my feet.  China King didnt quite do that but it was very very good.  Fellow yelper Robert J and I went right as they opened so we did have to wait a minute for them to get all the different dim-sum dishes.  Worth the wait.  Service is very typical for a chinese/dim-sum spot so you have to find the really good english speaking servers to get what you want without any confusion.    Oh and if youre unable to work chopsticks be aware asking for a fork...i got the stink face for some reason when i asked for one. i know how to use them i just got a little lazy as i got more and more into my food coma...  Will definitely visit this place again...',4
'I went here on Sunday for dinner with my family. I really liked the ambiance inside its a nice place to go on a date or with a group of people. I *loved* the house antipasto salad! That alone made it worth coming here. I ordered the cheese ravioli with meat sauce and everyone else ordered the lasagna with meat sauce eggplant parmesan and shrimp scampi. No one liked the lasagna (even though it looked so good in the picture on the menu) but everyone else enjoyed their meals. To me its one of those places that Id recommend trying at least once but there are definitely better Italian restaurants out there.',3
'Never again will we go here. We are fairly sure we got FOOD POISONING from eating here. A friend of ours insisted we had to go for the fish and chips: place was pretty empty when we arrived and we were told to seat ourselves. The appetizers were pretty good- pizza mozzarella sticks.   I dont like fried fish so I had a chicken sandwich which had mayo. My husband had the fried fish as well as coleslaw(made with mayo) which no one else in our party ate. 2-4 hours later we both started feeling quite ill- agonizingly painful stomach cramps nausea and several other symptoms I wont go into here. The symptoms lasted for 4 days. Bottom line avoid anything with mayo.  We certainly will not return.',1
'Dont even bother. The food served had no relation to the beautiful pictures on the menu. Plus the excuses we got for the inconsistancy were laughable. JR',1
'I am giving up on AT&T/Singular.  As long as I stayed with the cheapest cell phone I think known to man they worked fine for me?  Three phones and a few years later I am giving up.  l am a caregiver for a lady who is older.  I cant tell you how many times she and other people have told me they cant get through to me when I havent left the city limits.  If I am going to have a stupid cell phone-I could live with out it Id like to get at least 60% of my calls.  Verizion is always rated the highest in virtually every study I read.  It is also the most expensive which I can deal with if I can get my calls.  I can keep my same number and get better service-I Hope I hope I hope.',1
'Its an awesome thai restaurant and their peanut sauce at salad bar is a thing to die for. My office is not very far from this place and everyone in my team is always ready when we decide to go to Yuphas. This place is generally packed at lunch so advise is to call before if you have a large party.  As with every thai restaurant if you are vegetarian ask them to avoid fish sauce. Highly recommended overall !!!',5
'Attempting to eventually have a drink at every bar on Mill led me to try this place. I had a $2 Rolling rock which was on special and there was nobody inside or outside the bar at about 7pm on a weeknight. There was a nice female Hungarian bartender making small talk with me also but I was assured that the cook was from Texas.    If I had just gotten a drink and not tried the food this review would be better. Most Texas BBQ places cut the meat right in front of you and chopped brisket is not an option. Both of these ideas were shattered as the meat process unfolded in the back of the kitchen and after arriving home noticed it was chopped served with a simple hamburger bun. The brisket was very average and BBQ sauce was on the sweet side but brisket was cold and needed reheating. Macaroni and Cheese was my side dish choice and it was gummy and had no cheese flavor at all. I had to reheat and dump my own cheese on the thing to salvage that stuff. I only p[aid $7.44 total for the meal but an empty place a secret brisket session in the back and horrid side dish should knock this place out of Mill sooner than later.  Texas BBQ House is the only choice!',2
'This is an excellent authentic Chinese Restaurant!  I would give it a 5 star with just a bit better service at the table but that is NOT a reason to avoid this location.  The owner is friendly the food comes out hot and fresh and the clientele is mostly Chinese which tells me it truly is a great place to eat.  We tried many different dishes.  I do mean different.  If you like the traditional Americanized  Chinese food you will be disappointed.  If you like authentic cuisine head right in.  We will go back!',4
'Dr. J and his staff are excellent. He is a great dentist who works fast knows his business and keeps you   Dr. J runs a tight ship. His interactions with his staff illustrate his attention to detail and high performance standards. He keeps meticulous records with multiple photos and x-rays to serve as both historical documentation.  Bottom line: Highly Recommended',4
'Bummed it doesnt carry the higher end baking chocolate that I use but eh...cant have it all can I?  This store is definitely a bit on the older side and not brand spankin new like other grocery stores. It does the job all right for being the closest one but when I feel like I need a bit more variety and am stifled in my choices I go to Frys a bit further down the road.',3
'Postino is an amazing place to chill and relax with good company good food and amazing wine.   We had a nice Friday afternoon lunch outside with a glass a wine and it was a perfect atmosphere. The Arcadia location makes you feel like youre in a small town rather than a city like Phoenix.   The cheese board - amazing!',5
'Cibo is great.  Ive been there a ton of times and its really cozy and Im never disappointed in what Ive ordered.  The last time I went we shared a salad and margharita pizza.  Its a great place for a nice date and love that theres a patio.',5
'The Vu is a very cute little restaurant with a breathtaking view. We sat on the patio overlooking the entire valley and it was by far one of the best Ive ever seen. I had wine which was a rosa champagne blend with wine and it was delicious. We shared the Bruschetta platter which was delicious!! After we decided split the personal pizza and we were pretty disappointed :( The pizza just wasnt that good. its tastes like doughy microwavable pizza. I would go back because the bruschetta and wine were great and maybe it was just a bad night. Ill just try something else.',3
'I so wanted to like this place especially since it is so close to where we live. I really liked the decor; Ive never been to the previous Sophies Bistro but it looked like Gordon Ramsay came in and redid everything. The tables were nicely arranged with tablecloths and the artwork consisting of perfectly framed and positioned photos of vegetables was clean and fresh. It would be nice if they just added some candles on every table.  Keep in mind that this place is not inexpensive by any stretch; consider it fine dining. In line with this concept the portions are very very small. And while the menu has plates described with just a few words they are far from simplistic. We started with a foie gras beignet and the pork pupusa. Little did I know until our server told me the beignet had a component of the foie gras in it. I was expecting it to be stuffed or paired with a seared slice of foie gras one of my favorite things when I can find it a restaurant. Unfortunately all I got was a 2 square donut with a foie gras foam. The tangelo marmalade underneath was a nice compliment but it turned this dish into a more sweet than savory amuse-bouche. On the other hand the pork pupusa was a nice arrangement of pork sandwiched between a disk of fried corn topped with a wonderful salsa verde with apples and radish slices.   Moving on. The sweetbreads nuggets were very sweet reminiscent of a Trader Joes orange chicken sauce. In other words having never had sweetbreads before I couldnt even discern their flavor as the sauce was overpowering. The risotto was an epic failure. It was soupy and thus not really a risotto since it was made with barley instead of rice which was crunchy anyway. And we couldnt even figure out what the foam was.   Finally the entrees were just that; small portions like what the Europeans deem as entrees starters really. The sand dabs were more like doused in butter. Im still not sure what this fish is supposed to taste like if anything different that what sole is but I couldnt tell from this dish. But thats all you get in a small plate: no starch or vegetable. Keep in mind that everything is a la carte but we passed on the small hot or cold vegetable plates which I think they consider as appetizers: confusing. Amy must have never been to Italy because her dish is nothing you would find in Italy (Bologna would be insulted): basically a big square block of burned bread pudding plopped in a hot small iron skillet topped with a bolognese meat sauce. I dont get it. Why couldnt they just make a homemade pasta any shape will do as this is not that difficult with this sauce (which was pretty good actually)?  Essentially I think Chef Binkley is overthinking his dishes. Why not let the ingredients speak for themselves? If you are using the freshest ingredients why is it necessary to use gimmicks as an iron skillet foams tons of melted butter etc.? And while the service is great it was a bit overwhelming at first being bombarded with a server and two partner/managers coming to the table almost at once. Again overdone. There are a slew of servers expeditors and bussers all running around in comic sans-esce t-shirts. For a fine dining restaurant with these prices in this neighborhood there is too much identity confusion. Either be casual with casual prices and simple food or dress it up literally and provide big plates with big expectations. Unfortunately I guess I expected too much.',2
'Ambience and delicious Italian cravings is definitely the reason to stop in here.   When we entered the restaurant was dimly light but had a romantic trendy upscale vibe. We were torn between sitting inside or outside but ultimately chose the patio seating because the weather at 9:00 night was too perfect to pass up. We also got to gaze at walkers as they passed.   The tables had cute candles lit which emphasized the romantic atmosphere as well. There was couches with coffee tables to lounge and eat if sitting at a table isnt your thing.   Menu here is very simplistic but divine. After reading reviews of the bruschetta appetizer we had to try and I must note it was delectable. My favorite was the pesto with roasted tomatoes on top. Each piece was constructed with care and flavorful. We shared a pizza with garlic basil roasted tomatoes and pepperoni and it was extremely fresh and I loved the brick oven quality of it.   Service was courteous and insightful for explaining different items and drinks on the menu. I highly recommend this as a date night spot.',5
'Went there and was blown away by how terrible it was. I went on a Friday night with some friends got our drinks quickly then it took forever to get an order put in. I tried the back porch platter. on hour later when I got my food it was not the correct order they gave me brisket instead of tri-tip  Which I pointed out to the waitress and she said she wasnt sure but she would check and that was the last we saw of her until 30 minutes later when we got our bill. we couldnt even get anything else to drink. My ribs were such dried out boot leather that I had a hard time sawing through them with the steak knife that they brought out with my friends order. If I could give no stars I would. There are a lot better places in the valley for both service and bbq.',1
'After being stuck in the rural Midwest for two years where food options were extremely limited this place was a nice find for lunch.    Glad to have my Pakistani/Indian Yelpie friend present to order as I had no idea what to do.  We got chicken karahi goat biryani chicken tikka masala and chickpeas with some naan to share.  Food came out looking looking very homey and overall tasted very good.   The karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan.  Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels).  The rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat this was a bit gamey and dry.   Service was slow given there werent many other diners at the restaurant.  However portions were huge and very reasonably priced.  Total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers.   I would come back for more karahi and to try some other dishes. Probably for dinner though as the food is pretty heavy for lunch.',4
'Stopped by this weekend with my heart set on gluten-free bruschetta and pizza and they didnt have any gluten-free products available. When you offer a service that nobody else does its important to actually offer the service. Very disappointed.',1
'The Hole-in-One has not changed seemingly for ever.  You can count on their food and serve.  The food is fixed to the taste of its customers.  Not fancy just basic neighbor hood caffee food.  They have the community table in one side for the daily locale customers as well as ample booths and table.   Stanley they are open half days Sunday so their staff can have at the very lest part of Sunday off.    I have are adding some new items as over the past couple of years  or so such as French fried sweet potato.',4
'I went here for a late lunch with a few friends and it was pretty good. I would give it 3.5 stars only because of prices the size of the rolls and the attentiveness of the servers. I had to wait a few minutes with a completely empty glass of water for the server to come and ask if we needed anything else while the table next to us had a few refills without having to ask.  Aside from that the food was delicious. The rolls were smaller than I would like but they tasted really good. The fish was very fresh and the sauces were tasty. We also got the tropical punch drink that was huge and it was really good. I would go back but I would try the happy hour next time.',3
'Edamame dumplings---delicious  Caramelized onion tart---good Pan seared sea bass --- I really enjoyed the Brussels sprouts I didnt really care for the purple potatoes it tasted dry and overcooked the fish itself was cooked well Almond Olive Oil cake with greek yogurt---the combination of both of the ingredients did not seem to pair well with each other. I think had the almond olive oil cake been topped with anything else it would have been much better.',4
'Very good food fast even at lunchtime. Good selection of meats veggies egg told and wontons. Food  cooked fresh.  Healthy relatively. Ritter than a burger. Reasonably priced with tasty iced tea. A great lunch alternative to the usual fast good.',4
'The mall is not always the best place to find good food but Wildflower is a hidden gem in the Chandler Fashion Mall serving up fresh good food thats moderately priced.  Theres something for everyone here no matter what meal you seek--breakfast lunch or dinner and it is all good.  Breakfast is served later on the weekends but its worth getting up for on any weekday.  Their frittatas are delicious but Im nuts about the toast.  The bread is flavorful crispy and chewy all at once.  Just make sure you ask for jam.  It comes in a cute glass container and the flavors are divine.  Lunch is usually why I come here and Wildflower never fails to disappoint.  As a vegetarian coming to a bakery can sometimes be difficult.  Not many places offer veggie-friendly sandwiches that are actually tasty but Wildflower offers several.  My favorite is the roasted sweet potato but the portobello picnic is climbing the charts.  They rotate through a seemingly-endless selection of soups and always offer at least one (though usually 2) vegetarian-friendly soups each day.  My favorite?  The vegetarian black bean.  Hearty mildly spiced and served piping hot.  I wish they served it every single day but even if they arent I have half a dozen menu items from which to choose.  I finally had their pasta the other day and this has proven to be the second-biggest disappointment about this restaurant.  This isnt to say that it was bad!  In comparison to the rest of their stellar food the pasta was merely satisfactory.  Still filling and still a masterful medley of flavors and ingredients not often found in food at chain restaurants.  Desserts are rather eh.  Twice Ive had the coconut lemon torte (I think thats what its called?) and while the flavors blended well it had the distinct taste that freezer-burned baked goods have and that was enough to put me off of ever ordering dessert from them again.  Still the fast friendly service and excellent breakfast/lunch menu is enough to make me rate this place 4 stars.  Even during the lunch rush Ive not had to wait more than a few minutes for my food though it can be next to impossible to find a table sometimes.',4
'Im gonna have to go against the grain a bit here - I wanted SO badly to love this place! I had only heard good things and the theme - although a bit over the top - is fun.  I ordered some Thai Teriyaki something something local special that they had written on a little blackboard in the front. It sounded amazing.  What I unwrapped was a sauce-filled mess with 6 flakes of weird lettuce and white tomato slices. Oh and a metric fuckton of pepper. The bun ripped apart at the seam presumably because of the enormous amount of sauce that was on the sandwich. And Im a SAUCE girl people. If it pours or you can dip it then I want a lot of it. But this was over the top for even me. I threw over half my sandwich away.   The staff was fine but unremarkable no real complaint there.   The inside is kind of grimy feeling but I get that its part of the theme. If the sandwich was amazing itd definitely be forgivable.   Normally Id give it a second chance but with SO many different sub places around I probably wont risk it again here.',2
'I live in Chandler and will follow DR. Pottgen anywhere and everywhere she goes. If you want a great doctor go see her.',5
'This might be an odd review because I didnt actually go on a ride with them but I want to give them a positive shout out for solid customer service.  Long story short I work in media as does my wife and we each did a story with them.  They were very helpful and the customers I spoke with were very stoked on the ride and with them.  Thats part one.    I was SO impressed I bought a gift certificate with them for a present for my wife.  We had bad luck such as super high winds (cancelled) and emergency surgery ( cancelled) then I had a job transfer out of the area.  We were in a very unique situation and we were able to work it out and I just want to thank them.  A solid group and business...if something goes awry I feel confident they will work with you.  Thats it!',5
'Great Service and Management.  Great ribs and cocktails. BBQ Chicken is salty to me. Its a wonderful up scale pace no matter where you visit a location. Will return for Steak.',4
'WOW--What a cool concept! They have a humongous funky retail space thats maybe half full of vintage fatigues.....old school soda bar....produce stand....home accessories & nic nacs etc..... On the other side theres an eclectic old bar that was transported to AZ from a Chicago jazz club(Super cool) old timey cocktails & beers.....The Margarita was a bit too tart(due to--too much fresh lime juice-def ask for a lil extra agave nectar) but the brisket sliders were to die for & the Noodle Krugel (SP.) was by far one of the most amazing  mouth experiences Ive had in a while!!! Thank you Ellen for the Suggestion!! On in all--super cool new DT Hangout spot! Ooooooooh & apparently on Wednesday nights their doing a 60s themed party with funky decor & drink specials-they suggest coming in costume! I dig it!',4
'Love love love this place! The food was amazing the service was very good  and the chips and salsa are soooo good! We were also given a complimentary sweet corn tamale which were surprisingly delicious. We didnt have any margaritas but the iced tea was passion fruit-my favorite! For lunch I had the chicken tacos and my husdand had the chicken enchiladas. They were both very good portion size was perfect and we will definitely be going back!',5
'Borderline terrible. I had their veggie breakfast frittata and a cappuccino.  The cappuccino was returned twice then I gave up realizing that this place didnt have a clue what they were doing.  The frittata was edible but looked like snorting you would get from a hospital cafeteria.  The home fried potatoes were gross.  Worse than anything you would buy from the frozen isle at a truck stop.    Completely not worth ever going back.',2
'Needed a unique restaurant to host Sandras birthday party and suggested we get a teppanyaki table as the grandkids would have a lot of fun at the table.   That suggestion was a hit! The kids eyes were wide open during the whole cooking demonstration and Poppy was a hero for taking them to this cool place.  Food was very good and had some outstanding appetizers and drinks. Sapporo keeps on delivering not only food but atmosphere. I have been there several times (without the kiddies) and the sushi is very good. Loved the Poki Lamb Chops and Hoisin BBQ Ribs appetizers along with Sushi and Sashimi.   The Teppan Menu allows great combos whether steak and seafood or seafood and chicken. Cant really go wrong with any of the combinations. Wife decided to have the Emperor which includes Lobster and I had the Imperial. Everything was cooked to perfection and the kids thought this was the coolest birthday dinner and Jacob announced that this is where he wants to come. (Sorry Peter Piper!) Great experience.',4
'I love this place. It is probably the best place to get authentic Chinese food in Arizona. The pan fried shrimp with shell on is my favorite. I havent have anything from here that I dont like. The owner is nice and hes always at the restaurant. He is super nice and will even make special order for you if requested. Free hot tea! The staff is extremely nice and they know what theyre doing.   The menu can be a little overwhelming a lot of choices to chose from. But it also means youll never get bored with their foods.',5
'I have to say that even though I am not a huge Starbucks aficionado coming here last night was pleasant..  After patronizing Starbucks in NYC and San Fran for 2 years each its nice to finally be able to sit down and have a cup of coffee without there being a 1001 people in or out at all times thus making it a very unpleasant experience.  The drive-thru was not busy and only 2 people were there with on laptops.  The employees at the counter were very nice and we were chatting up a storm. Knowing that I will be able to come in here without a line during 5 p.m. is something of value to me. I would say I am glad to have this location in my neighborhood and will be returning soon! Thanks guys!',5
'I decided I wanted to do something new and different for my birthday so I decided to go on a local restaurant tour. Taste It Tours seemed like the best one they had good reviews online and they were located in Downtown Phoenix. I must say is was really impressed!   One of the main things I wanted from a food tour was to GET FULL and HAVE FUN. The Taste It Tour team provided just that with an urban experience. The tour started at the Ghost Lounge at The Hotel San Carlos and ended at My Big Fat Greek Express in Cityscape. In between we hit a number of great places including a local hidden gem 1130 The Restaurant and the popular Hannys.   1. The Ghost Lounge in San Carlos Hotel - I had never been to the San Carlos Hotel or the Ghost Lounge. I enjoyed hearing the local history and haunted stories. The tour guide did a great job at keeping us our toes and giving us a hint of what to expect for the rest of the evening. At the Ghost Lounge we were given a Margarita and it was delicious. It was smooth and hit all the points of a margarita but it didnt have that corny margarita mix taste which is key for me!   2. Hannys - Ive been to Hannys twice before and knew a little of the history but had no idea about the glass elevator the haunted doll room and the doll perched on the outside window on a top floor! BTW that totally freaked me out. We sampled Hannys famous flat bread pizza which never disappoints. Nothing new for me since Ive had both pizzas before but I enjoyed the history.   3. 1130 The Restaurant - This stop was probably worth the entire tour. Lobsters Mussels Mojitos.. Oh My! Lobster.. on a food tour? Exactly. Oh and everything was so good. The Lobster was the perfect serving size nestled in a bed of lettuce with a Thai type sauce to top it the mussels were cooked to perfection and seasoned lightly on a bed of buttered pasta and the Mojitos were perfect not too sweet. Not to mention the location was well worth it. My first time there and Ill be back very very soon.  4. My Big Fat Greek Express - I was a little wary of this stop. Ive been here many times at different locations and although I love it I didnt think it was food tour material. But then again they surprised me. The waiter brought out this wonderful flaming cheese that was smoky and spicy I also got a tasty lamb and beef sampler platter I got a Baklava that was really sweet it was good a little too sweet for me but for the sweet tooths in the group it was a hit. Oh and a Sangria finished it off. The Sangria was really sweet as well but for the sweet tooths in the group again a hit.   All in all it was worth every single penny. I left stuffed had a great time. It was really fun. Definitely recommended for out of towners and locals. Made me realize even more how awesome our downtown area is.',5
'Ive rented two tuxes from this Mr. Formal location and everything is was just fine. Most people wouldnt review a place unless they had a stellar experience or a horrible experience and I am no different.   A buddy of mine is getting married soon and Ill be in the wedding party. He asked my for my measurements including neck size sleeve length and suit jacket measurements. Now . . . how am I going to know that??   Mr. Formal to the rescue. I just emailed them asking for my measurements they took for my recent rental and they sent it to me--no questions asked. I was really impressed and grateful. Give them your biz!',5
'Friday night #evfn event. We had abotu 45 or so folks there a little less than usual Good Firday. Guess I am one of the reasons we went there. My friend Jeniffer invited me there a few weeks back for a cold one. The place was hopping at the time. Good bartenders friendly gals and had answers for all the questions: Whats good appetizers meals etc. Met the owner and had a great chat.  I ordered the sliders then and this past Friday. I had the meatloaf sliders this time. They had an unexpected kick to them. Probably a little extra pepper not complaining just wasnt expecting it. So if you dont like spice ask to see if the other is less.  The sliders are nothing fancy onion on top is great touch but other than bun thats about it.   Beer choice was good what do I know..I drink Pilsners and Coronas. Had the Corona. I ordered during Happy Hour so my tab was about $8 $4 for the sliders and $3 for Corona. On a budget these days so that was about it.  I did get to try the battered fish from a friend that was mighty tasty and I saw two friends devours the peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream. All I can say is that Rachel and April both had BIG grins on their face and looked very satisfied.  Our waitress was awesome in that she didnt mind separate tabs didnt ask for cards etc. and checked you out when you needed to leave. Ii did take a little longer for the new/late folks to get ordered BUT the orders came out VERY FAST!  Id would come back we would of thought about outside perhaps but we picked that Friday when by about 5pm it looked like 10pm with all the dark clouds.',4
'I really like this place. Im from San Francisco and this Chinese food is the closest to home Ive experienced in Arizona. One of the only places that has honey pecan prawns. Yum!  Updated review: 2/10/13- Honey pecan prawns arent there anymore but its still good!',5
'For the same amount of coin Id take some ghetto Chinese over a bowl at Samurai Sams.  This is obviously healthier than Chinese theres no doubt. The Sumo Bowl ($10!) I ordered had better quality meats and vegetables than youd find at a Chinese take out. Tasty however it was not.  The ingredients were not seasoned enough for my tastes and I did all I could to add some flavor. I added some soy sauce Japanese red pepper and salt & pepper. Adding these after cooking proved pointless and I kind of suffered through the meal instead of enjoying it.   Perhaps theres some sauce that I forgot to ask for which will render the Sumo Bowl less healthy in exchange for deliciousness?',2
'After reviewing the Starship McDonalds up in Flag last week I noticed I forgot to post my review of this Next Generation fast food place from three months ago. Doh!  Wow!  You have to give Wendys credit for thinking outside the box.  This fast food restaurant is like no other Ive been to. As some of my photos can attest this is more of a comfy chair club with a lot of eye distractions than fast food chain with plastic chairs. For instance it has a huge flat screen HDTV blasting ESPNs Sports Center that is situated above a faux fireplace. A for effort!  This Wendys also has a coffee/barista station.  Though the Joe tastes more like a water down Seattle Best. Too bad they couldnt get a Tim Hortons contract eh!  Also new is the Coca-Cola brand soda dispensers that tends to make everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So if you are from Texas this might be a good thing. LOL  As for the food Wendys continues to let the corporate kitchen rethink their menu items.  The food is very good and it will be interesting to see where they go with it after a couple of years.  So in line with my thinking about most fast food places Three Stars A-OK. But Ill throw in a 1/2 Star for effort and originality.  Enjoy!',3
'A friend of mine recently told me about Pomegranate Cafe in Ahwatukee. I didnt know that all their menu items are vegan---how cool is that? All the baked goods and menu items are vegan but they do offer eggs (instead of tofu for breakfast/brunch items) and dairy cheese (instead of vegan Diaya cheese) to appeal to vegetarians.   We went for a late afternoon lunch today and ordered pomegranate iced green tea roasted red pepper hummus platter and tempeh BLT sandwiches. The tea was tart and naturally sweet; very refreshing. The hummus was tasty and served with vegetables and warm bread slices. The BLT was simply awesome. I have to learn how to get my tempeh to taste like theirs! The baked goods looked way too good to pass up. So against my waistlines wishes we got 2 slices of vegan cake (lemon with strawberry frosting) raw vegan donut holes and coconut macaroons to take home. I will say that the donut holes dont actually taste like donuts but they were still delicious. The cake was so amazing that I muttered to my husband that we need to order a whole cake (Ill have to see if they offer whole cakes...it was like wedding cake-good). I wish I could have tried everything on the menu...I just have to make plans to visit often. The berry pepita french toast sounds absolutely divine...for next time.',5
'Three hours flew by last night at Eddys.  Dont believe time is relative?  Compare three hours here to almost anywhere else.     The Good:  Crab Cake appetizer (wow) the wine list haddock entree stuffed shrimp Godiva dessert and the blueberry cobbler.  All simply perfect.  The Bad:  We were there for three hours and it felt like 45 minutes.  So clearly time speeds up in some sort of cosmic time-space twist while eating at Eddies.  Im thinking this means one ages faster (bad).  However this has not been independently verified. ;)  Last I have to say something about the service.  Sometimes when eating at higher-end establishments the service is almost too servicing.  Yes sir no sir let me wipe your mouth sir I cant talk to you like Im a human sir its against the rules.  Not so here.  Very professional and knowledgable service yet friendly and fun.  We even got surprised with a free dessert for being a fun table!  (And no she didnt know Id be Yelping.  Or maybe she did.  Who cares!  Same result!)    Oh I have to mention ambiance and dining room design....dark moody romantic.  Great place for a date....',5
'A Nice Change. Unique Experience. Food & Movie Experience Simultaneously. I sat in Fork & Screen for the matinee (only $6 per person). Other people said they had bad customer service in fork & screen but I received awesome customer service. I got there before the movie started and placed my order during the previews. My food came out quick and Diner quality (tasty but probably not awesome quality).   Quick Note Regarding Parking: Park behind the movie theatre by where it says AMC & Shops. The movie theatre will validate your parking for 4 hours of FREE parking.   If you are a shopper....You can walk the underground path to the Biltmore mall afterwards for some quick shopping.',5
'Yes please! I really like this Johnny Rockets! Every time I come here I leave with the biggest food baby! Even though this is a chain restaurant I cant get over their delicious chili cheese fries! I am a sucker for good old fashion chili cheese fries! Its nice to come to a laid back atmosphere on any regular day and enjoy great oldies music friendly staff big old school burgers chili cheese fries and an Oreo shake to wash it down with! It also helps that its in the mall and I love to people watch! A great ending to a long day at work! Hopefully everyone enjoys an easy quick yummy spot like me! Remember it doesnt always have to be fancy to be great.',4
'Great service food was definitely delicious (Recommend the Burger). Live music on the weekends which makes it a long wait for a table but certainly worth it.',4
'Regardless of which HP I go to I am happy with the food...except for the chicken wings.  blah.  Theyre soggy.  But the pizza!  Love them!  as well as the chopped salad.',4
'Went for dinner for my moms birthday! Had the fried eggplant  and the bone in rib eye. Food was good. We had gone to the bar and ordered some drinks then we were given the option to cash out and pay or transfer the bill. We chose to pay but then after we were seated and tried to Order the same drink (wine) they told us we could no longer get that same wine. However the waiter still received his drinks from that same bar. We just felt it then forced us to order the cheapest bottle as an alternative which was 60 dollars.  Service was great! Jeremy was very nice and knowledgable.  Very pricy but definitely enjoyed ourselves.',3
'this was across my workplace when i was in az. me and my co workers always ending up going to this place at least once a week because you just cant go wrong. my favorite is the jalapeno pizza which i always partner up with a side salad and an ice tea. finding a table can sometimes be a pain during lunchtime but hey who cant blame them. this place is just that good. dont forget to get garlic knots on the side too if you feel like splurging on the calories haha.',4
'The wings here are just awesome.  So so good.  Lots of meat and they get them super crispy.  I had the extreme honey habanero the atl style and the hottest they had (i believe called extreme or toxic).  All were amazing.  The atl are a dry rub and just have a great saltiness to them.  The honey habanero are a great mix of sweet and really hot.  The toxic were a a blazing hot buffalo.  Lips numbs nose running and very very satisfied.  Will be going back.',5
'The staff here is so great and humorous! I had to wait forever for chicken nuggets but they threw in an extra nugget and they were nice and hot and well cooked. Dont know why I craved fast food but next time I am sticking to a frosty.',3
'Picked up lunch to go after finding this joint of yelp. My chicken cranberry salad was really good...chicken breast was sliced thin and I liked the balsamic dressing. The boys were super happy with their turkey clubs.  Fast and friendly service.',4
'I brought my 6 month old poodle here...very nervous because this was her first groom. I told them I didnt want her to have a poodle look and they did a great job!  I will definitely come back!  Thank you!',5
'Great selection prices and service.  I go here every once in a while when I need some alcohol but this review is more about a lesser known service that Bevmo provides.  Every couple of weeks they have one of their wine distributors come in to do a class.  Well I guess it is more of an information session than a formal class.  Anyway a guy brings in about 5 or 6 wines and provides information about where they come from and other misc. info.  The guy has lots of great stories and provides some interesting details about the wines.  Each session is about a different wine region and/or type of wine and is about an hour.  It costs just a few bucks and you get 5-6 good size pours along with some cheese and prosciutto.  It really is a great value and a pretty good time.  Not many people show up so its not that bad when I ask stupid questions.  Last night was the 3rd class Ive been to so far and as always it was a good time and very informative.  Talk to Jim Bevmos manager if you are interested in signing up for the next class.  He will add you to their list and shoot you an email with details when the next class is coming up.',5
'Have you ever been to a store where everyone is so friendly and helpful that it kind of freaks you out?  I have probably been to more different Home Depots than most people so I have a pretty good handle on what the typical Home Depot is like. As far as merchandise layout and cleanliness is concerned this location is a little above average. Where it goes really over the top is in its customer service. I have been here on three different occasions;  once solo and twice with my husband and on all three occasions every employee went above and beyond to greet us and ask if they can be of assistance. Maybe I am cynical and jaded but after the 4th or 5th employee approaches us and is super friendly I start looking around for a hidden camera. This Home Depot might want to dial it down a notch.',4
'I was pleasantly pleased with Scorpion Bay Marina. Known more as the party marina since its a public marina I found everything to be seamless clean and the staff to be friendly! Scorpion Bay does it all. They do boat rentals docking for your own boat and they also have a fun restaurant called Dillons. Its a great place to begin and end your day at the lake!',4
'This place is awesome. I love the shepherd or sheep herders pie it was phenominal!',5
'Four stars for clean three stars for the wall relief or sculpture or whatever two stars for the food.  And food is what I went there for.  Scratch this one off my list.',2
'There is another Honey Bears at Thomas & Central in Phx.  Both locations have great BBQ sauce - not too spicy but makes you want to eat more of it.  Great spot for relatively inexpensive lunch.',5
'I really like the Sushi Room! Only I live in Phoenix...so its a bit of a trek for me.   If you live in the East Valley and want to do something more Americanize/Urban with fun drinks I say have a stop in. The quality is top notch and the rolls are super inventive.  Oyster snob/lover? (I am but you dont have to be...) They have fantastic ones available. Their Happy Hour is well priced and varied (you know how other places Happy Hours can be).  Really lovely attentive people working here as well.  Go and you wont be disappointed.',4
'A friend of mine took me out here for a belated birthday dinner. I have always wanted to try this place so it was a welcome surprise. We were seated on the patio since it was a nice evening however me being the wimp that I am I had them turn on the heater because it was a little cooler than I thought ( plus it didnt help that I had a a very thin top but that is another story lol)  We ordered Mai Tais for our drinks and let me tell you those suckers were strong. Luckily for me I was not driving and my dinner companion sipped his sparingly. We had the Mexican Potstickers as an appetizer however although they were good they were quite salty.  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Poblanos as my main course and my friend ordered Chorizo Stuffed pork chop. Baby my Poblanos were stuffed with so much crab!! OMG it was soo good. They were huge as well So big that I even after sharing I ended up taking one whole one and a half one home with me. My friends stuffed pork chop was delicious and the red chile cheddar mash potatoes had just the right kick. He too ended up taking half his meal home because the portion was so good. Oh and if you think I am complaining believe me I am NOT by any means. I also ordered a pina colada later on (as again I was not driving) and that too was just as strong. They do not skimp on the alcohol and I was very happy about that.  Nothing like spending $9 on a drink and you cant taste any alcohol.  Now although were were stuffed to the gills we also ordered a piece of key lime pie to share. Delicious to say the least. With the exception of the ultra salty mexican pot stickers the serve the food and most importantly the company was fantastic. If I am ever in the area again I may have to check out there happy hour.',4
'I have complete confidence with this shop. Super knowledgeable and were quick and friendly.  I took my truck to them for a second opinion and they found that the recommendations from the other shop were completely untrue.  I saved over $700 by having them do the work and not the first overpriced shop.',5
'Great customer service and much more affordable than PODS.  I really like that they are local and keep everything stored in an air conditioned area. This was my first time using a portable storage container and wouldnt have made my move any other way.',5
'Start your day here! Really its that good :) Delivery is also available!',5
'Ive been to Chase several times and its a nice park.  Last night however I sat in the Club reserved level.  The seats are nice but you are never in them.  I was at the Club level bar and then the Arizona Baseball Club area.  They are a lot of fun and add to a unique baseball experience.  Great food and a great selection of alcohol.  I dont think I can ever go back to normal seats again.',4
'Over the past year I have visited Urban Cookies a few times constantly stalk them on Instagram (check them out if you can urban_cookies) and am fortunate enough to have cousins living in the PHX area who will make special delivers of Urban Cookies for us.    This store really is a gem in the middle of the city.  They strive to use local and organic ingredients while providing a high quality and homemade product.  I have appreciated their cookies pies bars and cupcakes even more now knowing that they are constantly testing our new and seasonal recipes striving for perfection before their product hits the store shelf and goes into the consumers mouth.  When visiting the Phoenix area I strongly encourage you to sample a few of these goodies!  My favorite is still their pineapple coconut cookies while their snicker doodles come in a close second.    And remember anytime anyone offers you a sample take them up on it!',5
'Ive stayed here twice before and I think its a wonderful place for anyones whos visiting.  Close the mall movie theatre Biltmore and most importantly Shreiners Sausages.  Really though.  Its always clean roomy good A/C.  Probably one of the best Embassy Suites Ive visited.  And way cheaper than the Biltmore for sure.',4
'This deli has a nice collection of classic italian foods.   I tried the veal parmigiana and it was excellent. The meat was cooked perfectly and the ultra-thin breading magically disintegrated in my mouth. These were layered with tasty mozzarella cheese and marinara. It was a very satisfying meal.  I also got to taste the veal meatballs. These also had excellent flavor and were much lighter than typical beef meatballs. The meatballs had a nice herbs and spices. In the middle they were very juicy and flavorful.  Order and pay at the counter in this deli as you walk in the door. If you are eating in the cashier will deliver your food to your table when it is ready. The meal prices are in the $10-15 range and the portion sizes are huge which allows for extra leftover meals. I would go to Aiellos again when in the mood for Italian food and in the area.',4
'First time trying this place I would come back for more.',4
'I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place for a while.  I took my friend here for a celebratory dinner last week.  Overall we like this place.  Service was very good.  The bottle of wine we ordered was out of stock so our server suggested another bottle but offered it at the same price as the bottle we wanted.  Nice gesture.    The corn cakes with pulled pork appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  Very good.  The Arcadia Salad was also good.  Being from New Mexico and loving green chile the green chile Mac n Cheese was a little dissapointing.  The ribs were ok.  Certainly not fall off the bone.  Love the ambiance and openess...with the exception of the music.  More about that below.  Interesting artwork with the chalk board feature although it is so cluttered to the point that we couldnt take it all in.  Sometimes less is more.    As I aluded to earlier...Im a firm believer that music is the single-most make or break factor to a great ambiance.  The music simply does not fit.  Paula Abdul did not add to my enjoyment of dinner in any way.  Maybe we were just at a cheesy point of the mix but I think some more edgy/progressive/hip music could do a lot in further creating an enjoyable ambiance.  Overall Im a fan.  Good Job.',4
'if you havent been here then i am sorry. the food is beyond description and requires that you eat it before we can talk in any detail about its yum factor. let it be said that the royale with cheese it a masterpiece. excellent choices for beer as well. service is very good and has loads of character.',5
'about six months ago my grandmother gave me a ring that had belonged to my late grandfather in the hopes that i could have it made into something for my upcoming wedding (as my something old).  i had no idea where to go or which jewelers did custom work so i turned to yelp.  after reading all the glowing reviews on burland i decided to take it to them and see what they could do.   i wanted to maintain the design of the diamonds on my grandfathers ring but have it placed in a more delicate and feminine setting.  they found the perfect white gold band that kept the original look while updating the overall design.  while i was at the store they even cleaned my engagement ring for free!   it took about two weeks to put together and i was shocked at how beautiful it turned out! they were even able to use the scrap gold from the band of my grandfathers ring to put towards the payment of the new one.  and they cleaned my engagement ring again for free!   if you need custom work done or want to buy some new jewelry this is a great shop to go to.  the two women i worked with were extremely friendly and professional and i never felt like they were trying to overcharge me or pressure me into higher priced bands.',5
'So I had The Jerk Chicken Rice and Peas With Plantains And Cabbage. The Rice and Peas were the best thing about this place everything was was not good at all.  The Jerk Chicken had no flavor no heat at all and if you had Jerk Chicken you know it should be spicy. I had better places. This as my second time here I forgot the reason why I didnt go back now I know. Will not go back again',2
'Ive had several facial treatments performed and Im extremely happy with the results.  My skin feels and looks younger healthier and invigorated especially after the message.  Shayna has a great personality and shes a good conversationalist.  Im a dedicated customer so where ever she is Ill follow.  Professional inexpensive experienced and great customer service/care what more could you want.  Certainly deserves FIVE STARS +.',5
'Best chips and salsa',4
'Good food nice experience',5
'My friend and I recently visited a friend in Scottsdale and we all scored Groupon tix for the DBG for $9 which makes it WELL worth it.  We really had a nice time walking around and chatting and enjoying the scenery. Ive got a weakness for flower photos so I was digging on the Wildflower path the most. There was a butterfly exhibit but (from previous experience) I feel strongly that they are gigantic insects with pretty wings so I stayed away.  We did see smaller butterflies along the paths though as well as hummingbirds.   Bummed that the website lists the Chihuly exhibit on the main page yet it ended in 2009. Luckily I saw most of it when it was in Boston last year but it turns out there are a few pieces near the entrance.  It was a beautiful day in a beautiful place. If youre in the area I highly recommend it!',4
'Id love to give this place more stars but with the limited menu chicken    fingers waffle fries and a salad as the whole menu I just cant. A good place for kids who like chicken fingers. Both bathrooms were out of service but i am sure that was a temporary thing.',3
'Bill Johnsons has been out familys go-to restaurant since it opened in this location. Heres the thing. Since their family has been having their feud the food has taken a dive. Prices have gone up long time menu items have been eliminated and the experience has been changed. Lots of the old timers keeping this location alive were chased off and regulars like me no longer felt welcome. Waitresses even complained to me about the negative working conditions that corporate was implementing. They tried so hard to attract a hip crowd that they lost the tried and true. This location is closed and probably will always be. I hear the CEO granddaughter got chased out by the board-maybe this will be the shot in the arm they need to restore their quality and continue their kitschy Arizona image.',3
'If you care about customers then you listen to what the order is.  3 different occasions and only 3 occasions they absolutely didnt cater to our vegetarian diet --- even though when placing the order they repeated it back perfectly ----   And how lame to have to call back or drive all the way back.  People have health concerns --- bottom line ---  and when you ask for NO SUGAR -- expect it here. And when you ask for NO SALT or Soy sauce in the side expect it.  Lets face it you can make anything taste like Sugar and Salt but thats not health ((( as they bill themselves as )))  Try catering to peoples requests.',1
'Serranos is a classic old school Phoenix style Mexican restaurant.  The restaurant is located in downtown Chandler and has preserved the intimate feel of a family restaurant from yesteryear.    The salsa and chips are simply excellent.  The chips come out hot and fresh and the salsa is chunky and tasty.  The food is basic no frill but great tasting no the less.  The fajitas are a sound choice when order as are the refried beans and rice.  The service is also great.    Highly recommended for a classically great tasting and comfortable outing for Mexican food locally.',4
'If there were 10 Stars I would give it 10 stars!!!!!!  Thank you Thank you THANK YOU my dearest Junior for introducing me to MacAlpines!  This is My absolute favorite Place.  Walk In here and feel like you have traveled back in time so amazingly kept original!  Wooden Booths with a hat rack at each end sooo cool!!  Eat their Mouthwatering food while you sing along to the coolest oldies overhead.   I must say my favorite meal is a tie between their Egg Salad and Chicken Salad Sandwich... mmmmmmmm... oh and their split pea soup!!!  Cocunut Egg Cream Soda!!!! AND THEY SERVE THRIFTYS ICE CREAM!! THE BEST Banana Split you will find!   And you get to shop while you wait for your food! YES! 2 rooms filled with the neatest trinketsa room filled with amazingly classy clothes/scarves/hats/pins a phone booth furniature You will want to buy it all.  You MUST check this place out.',5
'Centurion (noun): The commander of a century in the ancient Roman army.  I find it ironic that the name of the restaurant means the leader of an army of a hundred Roman soldiers yet the executive chef couldnt lead a team of 5 professionally trained staff to cook a half decent meal for a party of 10.     Regretfully my Yelp-fu skills has let me down once again. What I should have used was my Google-fu to get the 411 on Centurion. If I had done that Google would have populated my findings where one of the links was to a Groupon site for this restaurant. Im usually hesitant about going to restaurants that offer Groupon deals to attract business. Mainly because places with excellent food and service do not need to offer discounted meals to draw in customers. I highly doubt Thomas Keller would be calling up the marketing department of Groupon any time soon to set up a Groupon deal for The French Laundry to draw in more business.   When we arrived Chef Eric Osburn greeted us at our table and warned us that his kitchen couldnt accommodate a party of 10 people due to its size. To serve a party of 10 only groups of 3 people would be served in 20 minute intervals. He creatively suggested the Roll Out Menu where instead of each person ordering individual entree Chef Eric himself will take some culinary liberty and serve an assortment of dishes where we can all share as a group.   My initial reaction was Hell yeah bring it on!. There is nothing wrong with variety as long as you keep the food coming sir! This is why people go to buffets and organize potlucks so you wouldnt have to eat the same tupperware of leftover every night. We kindly informed Chef Eric the appetizers we would like to have as well as a preference for steak as the entree.    However my initial reaction of excitement dissipated when I kept getting repeated visits from Chef Eric refilling my glass of water and pouring our wine. Im thinking: Yo Chef shouldnt you be in the kitchen helping out with the food? I appreciate you topping off my water and everything but maybe if you pitch in a little you can possibly serve more than 3 people at once.  At that moment I started thinking. How can a restaurant with seating for more than 20 people at a single moment struggle with serving a party of 10. I have seen food trucks demolish a lunch line of 100 people in an hour. You are telling me you cant serve 10 people their food all at once when we were the only customers there on Tuesday night? What kind of janky-ass kitchen equipment do you have back there. If I walk back there I better see something like an Easy Bake Oven and a George Foreman Grill hooked up to the wall to accept that sorry ass excuse. But I digress...  After we order our appetizers and steaks we see Chef Eric running out to our table to ask each individual how they would like their steak cooked since he forgot to ask that question when he first took our order. See Chef this is why you should be in the kitchen working in front of your hot plate and have a waiter take our order. But Im not the one running a restaurant so what the fuck do I know right? Well right now Im thinking probably as much as you because apparently neither of us knows how to run a restaurant. Boom!  Retrospectively it didnt matter if we ordered our steak medium well or medium rare because it came out to a well-done rubbery piece of s*** anyway (must have used a George Foreman Grill) just like the Ratatouille that came with the steak. I must admit the only item I enjoyed was the Baked Brie Puff Pastry with Raspberry Jam. I should have asked Chef Eric where he purchased it because I KNOW for a fact that he didnt make it.    My coworker luckily could smell the bullshit a mile away and dodged a bullet by opting out from the steak entree. But no man could ever escape the deceit of Chef Eric. Chef Eric read him like a book and casually tossed out the Crab and Lobster Pizza as a substitute for steak. Being the self-pronounced pizza connoisseur he is he knew Chef Eric has found his Kryptonite. Weakened and defeated he agreed to the Crab and Lobster Pizza. When you order a Crab and Lobster Pizza I think it is pretty reasonable to expect some crab and lobster on your pizza. I think we have a problem when you are playing a game of Wheres Waldo? with the crab and lobster chunks on your pizza.   Our $500 Roll Out Meal turned out to be some shared appetizers we ordered and our individual child-size steak entrees. I think everyone at the table were all thinking Where was the rest of the food we were promised?   It feels like Im in that infamous scene of Oliver Twist where Im trembling and displaying my empty bowl begging Please Sir I want some more... And Chef Eric is that fat gentleman that was all flabbergasted by such a request going Whattttttttttttt!?!! You want some MORE?!    Sorry Centurion 2.5 stars!',2
'Finally I discovered a good coffee shop that is not Starbucks down the street from my house. The coffee here is legit I had to look up the brewing methods up on my computer after I walked in--I didnt even know that coffee could be something more than burnt beans steeped in water made by some frantic underpaid kid.   Oh but it is so much more than that.  The ladies working today were awesome (I came in on a Friday at about 2:30pm) very friendly and hustled.   Glad to have the free wifi some fresh squeezed OJ and a tasty delicious coffee.  I am giving it 4 stars however for a couple reasons:   1) they dont make their coffee in glass cups for stay-in orders and all of their silverware is single-use plastic. I get that businesses do these things for convenience but I KNOW you have a sink in the back. Its the 21st century and I think its time we get with the program and cut back on the single-use disposables when they arent really necessary.  2) I was disappointed with my yogurt parfait. Listen I get it. This is a coffee shop. MY first mistake was expecting the parfait to be as good as the coffee. It came in a plastic cup with Yoplait yogurt and the granola was a crushed up Nature Valley bar or something very similar. For the price of over $4 I would really have liked some REAL yogurt and REAL granola without all the HFCS/sugar. A girl can dream cant she?   I will know to order something different next time.   I couldnt help but laugh at some previous comments regarding the douchebag location. I grew up in this area so I feel your pain. The a-holes in their Lamborghinis spoiled children and plastic robot women are aspects of my going-out experience I would love to do without. But this is where money is to be made and they sure do make some great coffee.   4 stars. Make a better yogurt parfait and cut back on the single use disposables!!! :P',4
'Huge portions. Cheap. Good. Go! Now!',5
'Absolutely amazing!  Went on a Saturday afternoon and got lucky because it wasnt busy so we got a great table in the sunshine (a welcome escape from the Chicago winter).  The food was great and I had to stop myself from eating off my boyfriends plate.  I got the Pilgrim since I love thanksgiving dinner and it was so delicious.  My boyfriend got the Tiki Masala (sp?) which I liked even though Indian food isnt normally my thing.  Definitely going back there every time Im in town now.',5
'So a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant...  No seriously this is great stuff. I have a friend whos a veggie and loves Indian food so when I noticed this place sandwiched between a hair salon and a pizza chain I had to tell her. We checked it out tonight and DAMN. The Gobi Manchurian is amazing especially with the mint chutney. The spinach dosai is very good but a bit dry (not that that stopped us from fork-fighting over the last bits). This unrepentant flesh-eater went away completely happy and didnt miss the meat at all. Think Ill be coming back at least once a week.',5
'It was empty when I went.  Just flew into Phoenix and wanted a late meal (at some place that was still serving food).  I ordered the coconut chicken tenders and fries.  Amazing and creative!  Id definitely go back.',5
'This is a good spot for lunch if you work downtown.  Its inexpensive and depending on your choice can be very healthy.  Warning on the large sized portions though...youd better be hungry as they are large.  When you walk in the menu is on the wall and there are pictures of the various dishes.  I find that helpful in ethnic restaurants if I dont know what words mean.  I had the yaki soba and it was serviceable.  The best part was that it was really fast.    Id say its not a great place to take a group.  Most of the tables seat only two or four people.    But again its great for a quick healthy bite.  Cheers!',3
'Decent sushi great oysters (especially the current 95 cent each happy hour price) OK wine selection and tops for convenience. Running errands in t-shirt jeans and Birkies and have a hankering for sushi or oysters? The hubby and I did today and stopped in Fish Market. We usually sit at the oyster or sushi bars because we find seldom order the full meals. Today will ate our fill of both sushi and oysters and everything was fresh and enjoyable. Nothing to make me say wow but good. My other favorites are the Duckets Bucket (clams & mussels) and the spinach salad.   I dont consider Fish Market a destination place but when a casual convenient decent lunch of dinner is needed they always come through.',3
'Very helpful staff.  Location was a little farther than the Home Depot.  After the Yelp coupon the prices for the items that I purchased was on par with Lowest and Home Depot.  Those big box stores are OK.  However I am trying to support the local economy.  With an adequate selection friendly staff and close location I will continue to spend my money there.',4
'Fast food joint....Great at fast food Chinese. Nuff said?  Consistently good fast food is what Panda Express is all about.  If you have a Chinese craving and need to fill that void fast this is the place to do it.   I like chow mein fried rice and orange chicken: the main staples of fast food Chinese.  Glad to have one in Surprise as a selection for a quick lunch or dinner spot.',4
'Got back to the Valley of the Sun after being away all summer to find that Los Dos Molinos is now open 7 days a week including Sunday brunch starting at 11:00. We had the Huevos Rancheros and they were great. Headed back with friends next Sunday to sample more of the menu. Oh--and BTW--the Bloody Marys are great too!',5
'Dollar for my refill. Cant beat that. Love this place',4
'Disgusting.  I stayed here for a month during October.  The outside looks decent.  However when you walk in the place is a complete mess.  The front desk is very plain and looks like the place is going out of business.  The front desk workers except for one guy were all blah and not helpful.  When i got to the third floor the place reeked of cigarettes (i ordered nonsmoking) the carpet was stained and the decor looked to be from the 80s.  My room at first glance appeared decent.  There was a nice stove microwave and fridge couch tv desk and bed.  However the smell was attrocious.  It smelled like chemical as if they were trying to cover up the smoke.  I went to the store to buy some lysol.  Just as i was about to sit down on the couch i noticed white animal hair all over.  I went to the bathroom which appeared clean but as i went to lift the toilet seat you could see streaks on the seat from the cleaner (no telling what else was on the seat.  When i got in bed the comforter was torn (the bed was new however).  I was sent a review after the first week at which point i shared my thoughts about the room.  The manager emailed me back and said she would have the problems fixed but when i got home the animal hair and smell were both still there!  My room was not cleaned weekly rather it took me until my third week!  There is much more to discuss (all negative) but i am tired of writing already.  Bottom line is that this place is a dump.  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  And it is way overpriced for the quality.  The only reason i stayed here was because i am a poor medical student and couldnt afford anything else nearby.  Oh and then they had the audacity to offer me ONE free night as compensation and they are STILL sending me offers...i dont get it.',1
'Wonderful staff. Very helpful. I echo what others said:  rice with dates and raisins Persian ice cream. Big portions. I had lamb kabob and was very pleased.  A fine experience.',5
'This place is pretty good. The decor was great! The service was very good.  The food was good but not exceptional. We expected the prices to be much lower than they were.  Overall it is good and we would eat there again but we wouldnt go out of our way.',3
'The atmosphere is cozy hip fun but dont expect a table for two--and you may hear conversations that you dont want to--next to us a woman had just experienced her first anal exam--im not even making this up.  Our server was warm knowledgeable and welcoming.    The food is TINY and amazingly delicious--Tapas right?  well I guess so--I just think every dish is probably about 10% priced over what each dish should be 20% in some cases.    But that Sangria (red) calls my name--If only like my favorite place in San Diego it had the pieces of fruit floating in the pitcher/glass...  Still *by far* the best Sangria Ive had locally--Unless I count my own.    I am torn between rating this place a 3 or a 4--We spent 65 dollars (plus tip) and could have easily spent 20 more for just the 2 of us we went away not really full but the food quality and taste and service was great--then again the seating was cramped and outside would have been more tolerable with just an oscillating fan.  still we did have to listen to the ladys first anal exam-experience.  (In some company this wouldnt necessarily be a bad thing...)  okay Lola youre getting your 4 because the Sangria/Service/Quality are just that good!',4
'This is the mecca of meat lovers my husbands happy place and the only place he will NEVER turn down even when hes beefed out!  With about 12 different meat options and a salad bar you better come hungry and take your time enjoying all the options before you fall quickly into a food trance. Sure its a bit pricey at $50 per person but considering the quality of the meat is top notch and the huge all you can eat selection its well worth it every once in a while! They have everything from filet mignon to top and bottom sirloin and my favorite the lamb chops. Finger licking good! The salad bar is rather small compared to others Im accustomed to but the chicken and apple salad is memorable as is the asparagus (which are BIG). Your meal is accompanied by mashed potatoes plantains and polenta. These arent anything to brag about but who comes here to load up on carbs when you have all the meat to chose from. They also have a big wine room with a great selection.  I love that this is a Brazilian churrascaria that aims to look and serve authentic. The servers actually dress in authentic gaucho attire and most actually speak Portuguese! Last churrascaria I went to had caucasian servers who didnt speak a word of Portuguese or Spanish. Big points to Fogo de Chao! Like Sarah M. mentioned the servers are always accessible but not overbearing. They give you a small discs at the start of the meal - green lets servers know to bring on the meat and red lets them know to move onto the next table. So you can always enjoy your meal at your own pace without feeling overwhelmed.  I love it!',4
'Well... couldnt help it... gotta bump this up to a perfect five stars after our last visit. Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another Dogfish Shark taco because it was my favorite and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm.   The quesadilla was very different made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. Whats not to love about this place? Its just one of those easy to fall in love with little holes in the wall.   I think Id give just about anything for them to start selling their salsas to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back because Im hooked.   From what Ive been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world thered be a La Condessa on every other corner instead of a Taco Bell... eh baby steps I guess. 5/5.',5
'This place is fine--I cant say I have very strong feelings about it either way.  The cave ambiance is definitely unique but its a bit strange. There were also a LOT of kids in the restaurant so its a good place to go with a family. Margaritas were weak and watered down. Food was okay but not nearly as good as other New Mexican spots like Blue Adobe or Dicks Hideaway. I had the Green Chile burrito and it was good but not amazing.   Watered down New Mexican food if thats your thing.',3
'Picked this place to celebrate a birthday.   I thought it was tasty.  Portions are huge so you can share if youre in to that.  We all ordered different things and it all looked so GOOD.',5
'Today I stopped into Luna Pizza for takeout. It is a small restaurant. They have reviews that they post on the front counter. The guy that owns it Steve is from Albania. I would have given them five stars but the service isnt great. It is basically what do you want they take your order and walk away to make it. There wasnt a thank you through the entire experience. However the pizza is great. I got a 16 inch with half just cheese and the other half pepperoni and tomatoes. Wonderful. It is a little on the greasey side so you are going to need a few napkins. They also had calzones salads and pasta dishes on their menu but I only ordered pizza. The garlic rolls looked great - I might need to try them next time. They are right next door to Panda Express and Subway. I can never understand why Panda is always so busy which they were today. They are not that great.',4
'Ive been hearing a lot about Five Guys burgers but they have not yet reached Bakersfield CA where I live so this was my first experience with them.  A sign next to cash register tells you where todays potatoes are from (Rexbury ID  Browns Farm).  That is just too cool.  They actually keep track of the potatoes?  It gives me the impression they take great care with everything else too!  There are free peanuts in the shell; help yourself to as much as you like!  They have the good kind of soda machines where you can choose a variety of flavors or  mix and match.  My favorites are the Sprite Zero in raspberry vanilla peach strawberry and grape!  See I TOLD you there were a lot a choices!  There is a predominance of red and white in their decor especially in the checkered patterns. The black ceiling with scarlet duct work  looked great!  There was very loud music playing catchy tunes. (Pretty Woman was one of them)  The smell wafting through the restaurant is amazing    A regular hamburger comes with two patties and a small comes with a single patty.  The hamburger was thick and juicy and tasty!  TheCcajun fries were the best seasoned fries Ive ever tasted!  Im going to be dreaming/fantasizing about them for a long time!  There is quite a variety of customers in the restaurant.  On the day we were here there was a  national guard unit wearing camouflage uniforms there were young twenty somethings tatted up older couples with gray hair looking like they were heading off to the country club and me and my coworker who were in town for the weekend doing a live broadcast of a national dance competition (just call me twinkle toes).   Apparently EVERYBODY knows that this place has the best hamburgers in town.  So what are you waiting for?',4
'This place has a nice comfortable vibe a little personal with darker lighting and an industrial setting. I tried the Turkey club and it met all my expectations! As well as their seasonal Pumpkin Porter. I definitely loved this beer and it didnt taste terribly overwhelming like some seasonal foods tend to taste.   Great for groups & casual dates I imagine-- went there with my co-workers for lunch and we all fit in two tables. Co-workers tried the Peach pale ale Bleu Cheese burger (not sure on the name) their signature cheeseburgers with pepper jack and of course we added pickles.   The servers were attentive and friendly- I think someone mentioned this place has manly cooks and servers or something odd like that but they made their point and I guess Ill agree! My friend frequents this place for brunch- pancakes the whole shabang and she loves it. Im pretty thrilled with the comfortable feel the beer choices & the food. Its not your everyday boring pub food thats for sure.',5
'I dont like to give away too many 5-stars but when I do I ll give it to this place.  The Pho gods had answered my prayers.  I only asked for good reputable Pho instead I got exceptionally great Pho.  4-stars for the greatness plus 1 more star for making it CHEAP.  By that I mean it was still in the $6 range! Thats how I judge a Pho place the taste size and cost.  The freshness of the veggies and meat makes it even better.  Why not its located inside a grocery store right?  The first thing you need to know is its inside of Lee Lee Oriental Market.  Over the past year or so the market seemed like it was losing its appeal and soon after this restaurant opened it got life again.  I see more and more customers eating here which gives it notice and the credibility it deserves.  Prior establishments did not do so well.    Im a coconut juice whore and they make it fantastic here! Its not overly sweet and served over ice just the way I prefer it!  I will be supporting this place regularly.  Eat Pho all seasons baby!',5
'I love this place.  It caters to my OCD.  I like to have things in places where I can find them.  My hubby is always amazed whatever he is looking for in our home if he asks me I know exactly where it is.  I am now organizing the twins bedroom they have tons of stuff that need to be contained.',4
'Probably the best sandwich shop in the area.  My favorite is the SlawBeJo with homemande roast beef provolone cheese cole slaw russian dressing and mayo....and I dont even like cole slaw!...but its so good with the roast beef!  Their sandwiches are unique in that none of the meats are your typical sliced meat..they are more like a pulled meat...so good!    Clean place friendly staff.  Expect a small wait even if the place is empty...but it is soooo worth it!',5
'This was a major disappointment.  We ordered Cheese curds. Greasy and bland. Nosh plate would have been better if the only thing offered was the salami. The onion pickle was way too sweet.  The herb farm cheese had an Indian spiced flavor. At this point Im not sure how all these flavors can cohesively compete. And thats it!  They cant.  Mac n cheese was grainy and not hot enough.  The chicken and waffles was very disappointing.  The waffle was difficult to eat with a fork. I cut it and it kept crumbling. The white cheddar tasted like it was a powder...the kind you sprinkle on popcorn. Not good.  The chicken tasted over brined mixed with the breading it was competing. The one dish I did enjoy was the skirt steak.  Perfectly cooked nice mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. We finished with a chocolate and caramel cake. Good but not great.  I liked that it was not overly sweet.  It was a little dry. The service could have been better. It took some time to get drinks and to order.  The runner had no clue who ordered what. Slow on drink refill. The table could have been cleared before we received our cake. We had to ask for forks for the cake.  It was a cool space.  Too bad the food just didnt do it for me.',2
'Amazing great tons of food for a awesome price!',5
'I have seen Dr. Shafer several times - but never again. He is without question the most arrogant rude and inconsiderate doctor I have ever seen. He has a memory of convenience - not always accurate. He is the only doctor that has brought me to tears. And he is NEVER on time.',1
'Too bad Yelp wont allow you to give out 10 stars.  Located in a non descript strip mall like just about everything else in Phoenix.  This place has it together. Great food great service friendly people. If I had to complain about anything it is that one day I can imagine that one day the place will be too small and theyll be a wait but for now it is still somewhat a hidden gem.',5
'Not your typical greasy fat-laden pizza. Ive tried the White Works and Veggie. All were made with very fresh ingredients. If all youve had is Papa Johns (its been sucking lately) and other delivery-style pies and are interested in trying pizza with a cleaner taste give them a try.',4
'High end Mexican Restaurant?  Is there such a thing?  Sure there is!  La Hacienda is a perfect example of that.  Located inside the Fairmont Princess Resort this gem offers a high end Mexican dining experience.  Weve been here for happy hour and they have great Margaritas and weve come for dinner.  The dinner is spectacular.

They dont add too many Onions & Tomatoes which is a mortal sin for Guac and most restaurants do that.  The Queso Fundido is excellent and comes with fresh homemade Tortillas....definitely not store bought.  For the entree I had the Tampiquena which is a Steak cut thin and served with an Enchilada Corn Mash and Guacamole.....another excellent dish!  The Enchilada is covered in Mole Sauce which offers a smooth chocolatey taste to compliment the Steak.  Amazing.  Kiddo and The Wife had the Chicken Mole Poblano and the Barbacoa Taquitos.  They loved their dishes and finished their plate.  Dessert was the Capirotada and the Trio de Helados Fritos.  All I can say is yum!  I could only muster a bite of each because I was stuffed.  The family finished the rest.  Service was spectacular throughout dinner.  I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Scottsdale.  Return Factor - 95%',4
'Out of towners used Yelp and we were very happy! Well definitely have to come back when we visit the area again. Yummy burritos!',5
'Im not a vegetarian but this place is excellent.    This space used to be the In Season Deli another great establishement of 28 years.  However Desert Roots has picked up where ISD left off.  The menu changes daily and is always fresh.  Although their are some things I like more than others- everything has at worst been good and at best- been amazing.    A locally owned gem among the commercialism of what is now Mill Ave.',5
'SUPER CUTE!!!  Sushi was fresh service was great and atmosphere was stimulating!  Perfect place to people watch and enjoy some good sushi!  Hip Fun and Yum!!!!',4
'The gay waiter with the glasses was kind of an aloof dick but hey I get it... We cant all be fabulous at our day jobs.  He was courteous to our table of 50+ patrons and the blue cheese burger was pretty fantastic.  The night staff manager woman is awesome and was willing to deal with me in all my annoyed self when I ordered drinks.  The signs say that service ends at midnight but the security staff was escorting people to the bar as late as 12:15 so there must be some leeway...  All the TVs were suspiciously silent for this being a sports bar another plus...  Ill come back again.',3
'Hands down the Best Pizza in town!  Best Sausage...Mmmm!',5
'Yeah. Super pricey. Over $14 bucks for a greasy poorly made sloppy burger with two stale 4 burger patties. A large drink (the highlight of the visit was they had MELLO YELLO) and some extra salty fries.  Will not go back. Chuckbox has ALWAYS been the place.',2
'If my house was a store I would want it to be The French Bee.  Such great great house stuff and even some cool jewelry.  The prices fluctuate on everything.  I saw a necklace that I had to have and figured it must be too expensive so there is no way  I can buy it but it was reasonable!  So reasonable that I bought 2! -- Dont you wish we were friends?  When i find something great I buy them in multiples to give one away.   The last time I was in there it was around the holidays and they had the BEST CHRISTMAS STUFF!!!',5
'We wound up here unexpectedly when we found out the crepe place in the same center is closed on Mondays.  Wanting real table service instead of ordering at the counter at Wildflower we spied the Cove as we were walking back to our cars.  At 12:30 on a Monday it was virtually empty.    The menu looked good enough with plenty to choose from.  Both my friend and I wanted salads.  She ordered the calamari and I chose the Asian Chicken.  Her calamari was slathered with breading and my chicken was dry to the bone.  We both agreed that we should have gone to Wildflower where the salads are always reliably fresh and tasty.  Our server was actually very nice and gracious. But for me its a combination of food ambiance and service that make a restaurant rate above a 2-star and the food and ambiance at the Cove didnt cut it for me.',2
'Do not accept exchanges or returns. I hadnt even tried it. I mean not even exchanges? I wont go again.',2
'Went to NoRTH yesterday with friends for happy hour.  This place is great.  Half price drinks & appetizers. Their yucca chips are totally additive and the angus burger for $5 w/garlic fries is one of the best burgers around.  Our server Ivan was terrific.  Very attentive and funny.    All around a great place to hang out and enjoy good friends and good food.',4
'Had one of my all time favorite dining experiences here.  My sweetie and I sat at the kitchen table had great drinks and shared a delicious pizza. We split a tasty dessert and were surprised with complimentary Limoncello shots.   Left tipsy satisfied and delighted. On par with 4 star places that cost 3x as much.',5
'One of the best places to get real home cooked deli food... Meatballs Roast Beef Chicken Salad Baked Beans... And a host of other delicious food.. All home cooked prepared and served by the wonderful and friendly Casella family.',5
'I adding this as a 5 stars cause Subway is a Subway if you are into the subs they taste just as good as any other location they are not greedy on meat or toppings and the 5 stars comes as this location is now open 24 hours!!! You are going to find people who dont enjoy where they work anywhere you go in the food industry.',5

'After learning about a special rate celebrating the 40th birthday of Ben the hotel owner I booked two nights at The Clarendon the first in July the second in November.  I had visited the property once before a few years back when the restaurant on the premises was under different management; I was left with the impression that the hotel looked really cool and fun and I made a mental note to check it out sometime.  With the special deal I found I decided now was the time.  I booked a Jr. Suite for both nights and my first stay was last night.  I checked in early before my boyfriend arrived.  Rachel helped me check in and was really friendly and helpful.  I took  in all the details as I walked to the elevator and then to my room.  Really fun local tilt-shift photography was hung on the walls leading to my room (#221).  I wish I had snapped a few photos of my room because it was really fun - a great king-size bed with a funky upholstered headboard dark-wood heavy furniture a plush occasional chair by a lamp a long desk/dresser a 42 (if not bigger) TV anchored to the wall and awesome blue walls made up the room.  Unfortunately I noticed the room hadnt been cleaned properly.  By the Keurig coffee maker I found a mess of opened sugar packets creamer and used swizzle sticks and no  cups or coffee.  I called down to the front desk and Rachel answered.  I told her what I found and she came up to check it out.  She seemed sincerely disgusted at what she saw and she was very apologetic.  She left the room and came back with some cups and went down once again and this time returned with coffee tea and a wet rag to wipe down the counter.  She also brought a few bags of chips some candy bars and four bottles of chilled water.  She asked me what else she could do to make up for the mess but I told her shed done enough - more than was her responsibility actually.  Later that evening after a pretty dismal experience at the Gallo Blanco Cafe in the hotel lobby I stopped at the front desk to request some extra towels and some sugar for the coffee.  Ben the owner happened to be at the desk at the time and told me he heard wed had a bad experience at the restaurant and asked how our stay had been otherwise.  I told him about what happened before in the room and complimented him on having Rachel on his staff.  Like Rachel he was very apologetic and asked what he could do to make up for it.  He also told me it had been Rachels first day and I couldnt have been more surprised - what an asset to his team!  Before we went back upstairs Ben gave me his card and asked me to let him know when wed be staying over again so he could upgrade us to a full suite.  He then came by the room with a huge stack of freshly laundered towels (they were still warm!) and apologized again and thanked us for our patience.  Talk about customer service!  When we checked out Rachel was back at the front and asked about how our night went.  I recapped for her the rest of the events and she again thanked me for our patience and good nature.  This is why I support local businesses especially when they hire amazing people who know how to treat their patrons and guests.  For the wonderful customer service we were given Im rating this hotel five stars.  Ben and Rachel THANK YOU for being great.  I look forward to our next stay though I wish I didnt have to wait until November!  P.S. - The amazing AC in the room? What a delight!',5
'WOW --what a treat  And its FREE.. Awesome display of WINNING race cars and Penske racing memorabilia. I could spend all day here. If you love cars this is the place.',5
'The Spring Rolls are awesome!',4
'LOVE the pork belly appetizer the portobello sandwhich chop salad!! Overall great food & atmosphere only downside is they make a terrible mojito and an ok margarita.',4
'No parking!!!!    Unfriendly staff except bartender.  He was trying but quite marginal.  OMG!!!!!  1 HOUR AND 35 MINUTES OF WAITING AND $120 BAR TAB? REALLY???  Not our first time gave this place chances after chances before writing it off.  The hostess kept telling us 20 minutes after 20 minutes went by another 15-20 minutes etc.  We saw people that just walked in get seated before us!    Wasnt greeted when we entered not even a Hi can I help you?  Wait area outside or in the bar area.  My car is bigger than the bar /waiting area!  I dont have a big car!  The bartender was the only person in the place that we considered the most friendly.  Well the mango margarita at $12 was okay! Our meal tab was also over $120  for one salad one appetizer 1 sandwich 1 mixed seafood dinner and the slow cooked pork dinner;  2 beers;  AND was almost charged for 2 extra beers we had ordered but never got!!!  So check your checks!!!!!  No one smiles in the place which is filled with beautiful artwork thats for sale!  The music is blaring so everyone has to shout to talk to each other.  Good thing my husband and our male friend have loud voices.  The female waitress again seemed like she was having a bad day....or life? Had no interest in our opinions about the food plates were plopped down on the tables she came to check on us twice 2nd time the guys asked for 2 more beers which never came.   The whole experience started at 6:30pm and ended at 10!!   Service and the meals didnt match the prices!!!!! Ouch!!  A hole in a wall place that leaves a hole in your pocket!!',1
'Great Burgers and fries.... Great. I had a double double.... But did it beat shake shack in comparison of burgers alone? IDK. Maybe as a whole IN and Out is the winner but I just dont know if this is the king of all burger shops as many claim... I have been to Alot of different Burger places and eaten alot of burgers (shake shack NYC IN AND OUT Fatburger) Most of the big names have gone into and out of my belly... ANd I can honestly say In and OUt is good... Real Good... The Best ???? Idk.',4
'This place is great. Every year we buy our firewood here. Very reasonable prices and they load it for you too! While the dont take credit or debit they take cash and check. Great selection great prices excellent service! You have a forever customer!!',5
'I had not been to La Bocca for months...last time in March....and was really looking forward to meeting a good friend for dinner. When I walked in the restaurant it was busy (most tables full) and WARM! Too warm...almost hot. My friend and I were seated at a table by the window and noticed it was even warmer there but as it was the only table in the place open...Although we had delicious brushetta and salads (and their great pinot grigio Little Black Dress) we didnt enjoy them much as the temp in the room had to be over 85 degrees. Our leisurely dinner turned into less than an hour and lets get out of here. But the place was PACKED so I guess most people didnt mind eating and sweating. Maybe that is how they manage to turn the tables over quickly???',3
'Ive always had mixed feelings about the Paisley Violin--I really want to like it more.  There is a lot to like here:  decent beer selection local art hosted all around outside eating areas.   I went last week for a friends birthday shindig.  I had the chicken schwarma which was ok.  And perhaps that is what is missing for me at Paisley the food was just meh and the service was not outstanding either.    Its on my list for trying out more often and perhaps I will be more impressed.',3
'This was honestly the worst dining out experience of my life. When we walked in we said there would be 6 and we wanted the bar. After waiting 20 minutes (and a party of 3 and 2 being sat ahead of us) we said wed split up. Very luckily 6 seats cleared at once at the bar. They sat another party ahead of us! When I asked they said they didnt seat parties of 6 at the bar. They failed to mention this rule before we waited 20 minutes. They were horribly rude when we tried to discuss what was happening. The woman who said she was the manager stopped me mid-sentence and said Can you listen to me for a minute.  I couldnt believe how disrespectful she was. They lost 6 loyal customers and that is very disappointing to me.',1
'This place rocks for breakfast!!  I no longer live in Scottsdale and I miss the gingerbread pancakes- they are soooo good.  I am NOT a sweet breakfast-orderer either so if I  miss pancakes then it means they are truly amazing.  I can honestly say this is the only place Ive been to that I would ever order a type of pancakes for breakfast.  Theyre so good that putting anything on them (syrup or butter) just takes away from the amazing-ness of them. Their omelets are always fantastic too.  My favorite here is the delicious caprese omelet and Ive also had the veggie omelet which is fabulous.  Their breakfast menu is sooo great I wish I could go back and order everything.  Also they serve breakfast all day!  Awesome bloody marys too.   Love it!!!',5
'Absolutely my new favorite place! Just had my bridal shower there! Matthew was  great and also was Kimberly!!! Outstanding service! Exceeded my expectations!! Food was also out of the world!! Everyone was so pleased and they were beyond accommodating! Thanks guys! Youre the best!!',5
'I have now been twice to Binkleys and have decided this place is so not worth it. Located in what once was the Jackalope Cafe in a strip mall location the interior has changed little from the former buildout. The food is interesting and very expensive but fails to deliver. Everything is beautiful to look at but disappointing on flavor and preparation. My wife and I did the full tasting menu and enjoyed many of the offerings but the main entrees were not good. Striped Bass was overcooked smelled not very fresh and was served on top of a tasteless vegetable broth. Rib eye ordered medium rare was nearly raw and flavorless. We were glad we did not order the special Kobe Beef priced at $30 per ounce. Desserts are perhaps the low point of Binkleys. Corn with popcorn and bacon in some kind of sauce was bland and tasteless. Other desserts with multi layers of whipped cream and additives seemed like much ado about nothing. A first class pastry chef is needed here. On our previous visit we did a wine tasting menu sponsored by a Nappa winemaker with not much wine to be had. If you go for the food show spectacular there is nothing like Binkleys in Arizona. If only they could live up to their own reputation.',2
'HUGE airport.   Not as modern or clean as LAX or SNA but good nonetheless. Lots of little gift shops inside for tourists to buy knick knacks but my suggestion would be to pass through security first because the stores on the inside have better stock. Has all the essentials large cleanish restrooms coffee shops and places to eat. Shuttle service offered for those who are renting cars or going to local hotels that was very quick and efficient. I was satisfied.',3
'Growing up in Phoenix I have always eyed Long Wongs while in the family car.    Is it Chinese food?  No.  My friend had taken me there yesterday for lunch.  She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I mean what can be better than Buffalo Wild Wings?  I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.  This is by far the best place for wings!  If only theyd kick out annoying high school brats...  XD!',5
'I was a little nervous when I saw the line but I figured if there were that many people waiting it must be worth it.  Luckily the line moved quickly.  The hot dog was pretty good but the Italian sausage was one of the best Ive ever had.  The fries were just so-so.  The Italian sausage will probably bring me back a few more times.',4
'Based on this previous review I called Cheshire Cat and talked to the owner Paul about a termite track I found.  He gave me a free tip to help see if they were new or old and they were old.  However I said come on out anyways and take a look. He looked and found a new tube nearby and showed me a LIVE termite hiding in a mud-tube.  Yes... Ill take that treatment now...  Paul came out and did the treatment as advertised. He was polite clean knowledgeable and fast.  Recommended highly. Tj',5
'Took two girlfriends here who had never been here...everything was perfect. I got the Filet Mignon which is smothered in green and red peppers and onions and placed on a corn tortilla which is covered in cheese with fresh slices of avocado with a side of black beans and rice pilaf! While my friends had the new york strip steak and the some other 3 cheese entree. The food was all amazing the service was excellent. I finally got to see the Mariachi player play guitar and enjoyed the ambiance of this place very much...I almost didnt want to Yelp about this place...and wanted to keep it a secret...but I would rather that people go all carrot mob on this place so it stays in business. One of the best places I have been to eat in phoenix. Truly deserving of its five stars rating.',5
'Delish. Bowl of Balls. Tiny Pies. Enuf said.',5
'Today was my first visit here. This place had great reviews and was right by my house so I gave it a try. I called in and they were able to get me in for a gel mani right away which was great! When I got there I was greeted right away. I asked how much longer it would take for a gel pedi and she said not long. She then asked to pick my color and then she walked away. I picked out my color and waited-she made eye contact with me a minute later as she was sitting a table away on her ipad...and I told her I had picked my color. She said ok and the guy would be right out.   A guy came up about 3-4 minutes later and smelled like smoke. To each his own but it was REALLY strong! Anyway he popped a piece of gum and on we went.  I showed him the color and he went to work. He was very efficient and did a good job trimming & filing my nails & cutting my cuticles. He didnt ask if I wanted round or square but he did square and it was what I wanted so no big. Next he painted my nails and he did a good job and didnt seem to rush until he forgot to give my thumb a second cost. I looked away for a second so Im not 100% sure he missed it but he wasnt sure either... so he added another coat in case.  After my nails he started the water and said pedicure? and I said yes but I need to be out by 5 is there enough time? He said nope so that wasnt a huge deal but I told her when I came in that I wanted a gel pedi and that I had gel polish on my toes because I thought theyd start the soak off process then so when I was completely done with my nails he said there wasnt time because of needing to soak off the gel on my toes.  On my way out I paid by credit card and at the place I usually go there is a tip line. There wasnt one on the receipt I signed so I asked and he said it was too late and I could just do it next time. Again not huge but I felt bad and it seemed weird.  As far as atmosphere-it is a nice salon and very pretty but it was slow at the time I went and there was no music so it was a little awkwardly quiet especially when I tried to ask my tech how long they had been there and he said...5 years...I dont know and that was that.',3
'This is the perfect alternative to a W hotel!  This boutique hotel is a great alternative to your Comfort or Quality Inn for the same price!  I landed this hotel for about the same price and got a killer deal.  The place is very modern and hip.  It caters to the tech or younger person who can appreciate the art deco style and flair of the hotel.  The staff was incredibly friendly.  Our flight was not until the late afternoon and the staff allowed us not only to do a late checkout but also to relax at poolside for the rest of the day!  The prices are affordable and the place was clean.  The only minor issue was the fact that the air conditioner in our room lacked the Freon which allowed for cooler air in the room but that was not the hotels afault.  Being in Phoenix AZ Im sure all the air conditioner units have been well worked due to the nature hot environment.  Overall its a good place to be and I highly recommend the place.',4
'This new Hawaiian place is a couple of doors down from Eba Cafe. I wish it were any where near as good. Unfortunately it is the worst Hawaiian food I have had in the valley (which includes Aloha Kitchen L&L Ono and even Rumbi).   We had the Katsu and BBQ Chicken lunch plates. The Katsu was good white meat chicken and not greasy. Too bad it had zero flavor. The Katsu sauce was like no other I have ever had- cloyingly sweet instead of zesty and savory like I am used to. The BBQ chicken was well cooked and had flavor but it was overwhelmingly ginger (not my favorite). The white rice was almost a little greasy as if it had been buttered with a flavorless butter. The macaroni salad was almost as big of an abomination as the free salad we got. The salad was free because it was nearly dead (literally there were pieces of rotting lettuce in my bowl) and the macaroni salad was a bit too al dente and tasted as if it were dressed with just mayo. Yuck.   Synopsis? Stay away.',2
'Firesky Resort is great find. We had friends make the hotel resos while we took care of other parts of the trip.   As we walked into the lobby it was pretty grand  without being too over done. Makes you feel totally comfortable upon walking in.  The staff was great- totally laid back friendly and helpful.  Our room was good too nothing too fancy but everything you need.  Super soft sheets along with the perfectly weighted feather comforter.  The pool area is was fab its open 24 hours for a swim.  Where else do you find that at?  So when its still 95 degrees at midnight you can cool yourself down quickly.    Kimpton Hotels always include that special touch and this one is no different.  Well be back and it was nice to venture out for our stay and still be so close to everything you need.',4
'All you need is love.  For some things its all you need but for BBQ you need skill.  Grady has got the skills.    The beef brisket dinner was finger licking awesome.  It came with a hot side and a cold one so I got the Mac n Cheese and coleslaw.  I digged the mac but the slaw was average eats.  The beef brisket sandwich was just as good.    We also had the three meat dinner: beef brisket beef ribs and bbq chicken.  As before the brisket was awesome and the beef ribs were off the hook.  They were slow cooked to perfection.  The meat slid off the bone.  You just took a bite and it just melted like butter.  Everything was slathered with Gradys sauce which was magical.    I only had a 1 star taken off for the chicken being a bit on the dry side.  It must have been a fluke b/c Daren C. says it is tender and mmm good.    4 stars delicious.  I will be back to Phoenix soon to hopefully make this a 5 star review!  P.S.  The place all about the food and the owners love what they do.',4
'Excellent customer service and delicious fresh Italian food.  I placed our order online and when I arrived to pick it up I was promptly greeted by a nice young man at the cash register.  He checked to make sure my order was correct and let me know that they just started a new promotion where kids eat free on Sunday.  I ordered a Pellini my hubby had pasta and the kids had pasta bowls.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal and the kids even finished their bowls.  A first in our house! We finished off our delicious dinner with a nutella pellini.  Delicious! Thrilled to have an affordable fresh and friendly restaurant in the neighborhood.  Will definitely be back!',5
'Excellent food. They actually deliver. Ive called other restaurants that had a yes in the delivery section and they dont deliver. Not sure if that is the fault of the restaurants or Yelp. Anyway the food is great and I will be ordering from them time and time again. My toddler loved the food too (shes very picky).',4
'This place is used to be my favorite Dim Sum restaurant but I have not visited them for a while. Its not because of their foods.   Their foods is good and service is OK. Its their sneaky behavior at the register that bothers me. I dont know if they are still doing the same thing but I just got pissed of once for all.   Here is the story.   I was at the cashier desk to pay my bill. The lady at the counter did not know I can understand Cantonese. So the lady told customer who is a friend of her that the 15% tips is already included in the credit card receipt as total. So there is no need to put tips in the blank tip line.   What a shocking finding. If you dont calculate your total bill you may be paying double tips! What a shame on them. I dont mind to pay 20% tips but they should told their customer that the total number on your receipt already includes tips!  I have not visited the restaurant since!',1
'The food is OK but ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT. They overcharged me my sister and a friend on 3 separate occasions. Their explanation was that the prices went up but they hadnt had time to update the menu... but it has been months since the first time I was over charged. I will not give business to dishonest people.',2
'Ive heard a couple of good comments about this pizza so I finally gave it a try.   Its really good and convenient at a really fair price. I was reluctant to the cook it yourself approach but its stupid-proof it comes with directions and you can call them if something goes wrong (it didnt in my case :)   It comes in a paper tray oven friendly and I intentionally overcooked it a little bit so it came out crunchy and with a great taste.  An instant favorite!',5
'LOVE their chicken club sandwich.  Great barbeque sauce.  We needed a place to hold an impromptu family gathering and they were very accomdating to our large crowd at the last minute.  They have The Patriot Room that is so cool.  Stop by and take a look and have some onion rings. Theyre the best! I heard they have stand up comedy on Wednesday nights too.  Havent experienced that. We shall see...... :)',5
'Love this place really great asian cuisine! My friend Rebecca took me here once and now I go all the time. I didnt even realize such a good restaurant was so close! I recently started working in the same complex and the owner comes around all the time so friendly! I really love the Egg drop soup and Egg Rolls:)',4
'I tried out Ruths Chris a week ago for the first time. I really enjoyed the meal. A few comments:  1 - The food is very good. I liked the hot plates and the sizzling buttery steak. The filet was tender but not the best Ive had. The sweep potato casserole was tasty. The crab cakes were good.  2 - I paid $120 for me and my girlfriend. At a price like this I assume that the food is going to be good and my question is always How much better is this food than my $9 meal at Chipotle? Was it $120 good? I dont know... I would probably go back but not very often.  3 - The service was fine. But I didnt notice anything special or unusual about it as it has been described in some of the other raving reviews on this site.  4 - The combo where you get a starter side main dish and dessert for $53 is not worth it. It would be a great deal if you could choose any starter side or dessert. But the options that they allow with the combo are lame -- they dont include any of their good sides or starters. Youre better off a la carte.',4
'I dont frequent Chipotle because they pretty much have the same thing all the time.. not that thats a bad thing just that I can get bored quickly.  When I do go I do like to get their 2 soft corn tacos with beef or pork which is marinated perfectly.  They are a bit stingy with the meat servings but I guess I understand that if they are using hormone free (as they claim but you never really are sure) meat.  I usually make it up with added fajitas lettuce salsa etc.. then my tacos get really fat and filling.  The staff is nice and quick and gets my order done correctly.  This location can get really busy and have a long line at lunch (figures a lot of people love Chipotle) but if you do the phone or online order you can run in and pay and be out in a jiff.',4
'After spending a ridiculous amount of time on the phone today with US Airways they get an extra star.  Why you ask?  Quite simply because they were nice and overtly helpful when they didnt need to be.  Due to ice where I was headed to snow headed to where I am and a combination of snow and ice in every connecting city that would get me there.  I expected to spend hours on the phone waiting for someone to answer.  However my longest expected wait time was 18 minutes which actually ended up being 12.  A few times I had no wait at all.  Despite what must have been a hellish day in their call center everyone I spoke to was pleasant.  Though Im sure that being nice to them didnt hurt matters I was genuinely impressed by how quickly my need to reschedule was solved.  Heck they even asked me about seat preferences instead of just throwing me in the back corner near the restroom.  Now some of this happy treatment may be because I know have Silver Preferred status after a crazy 2010 of travel.  But honestly I had a similar problem last year before I was even close to preferred status and I was treated just as well.  After five rescheduling calls today Im hoping that tomorrow will find me on a plane.  And if not Ill be back on the phone.  Hopefully to another friendly US Airways call center person.',4
'The people at Central Phoenix Eye Care are great.   The staff was friendly the doctor helpful and the prices very reasonable.   Fantastic business.',5
'This is hands down one of the worst restaurant depots in the country. Understaffed inefficient filthy and unprofessional. I use restaurant depot all over the United States and this is easily the bottom of the barrel. The management needs to get their arms around this place and take a realistic look at the operation from top to bottom.',1
'I wouldnt waste my money going here. Ive been going for the past 4 years and had a great time. This past spring training I found the bar tenders to be rude and the bar to be the dump of dives. There are many other fun bars....dont waste your time here',1
'Tommy Vs does it again.  I frequent both locations in Scottsdale and Phoenix and I must say...  If you havent attended one of their wine dinners you are missing out.  Tommy Vs Urban Kitchen hosted Groth Vineyards on Friday and the price amazingly inexpensive for the amount of food and wine you are given.  Go hungry leave full with a smile on your face.  Excellent restaurant service and friendly professional staff.  Love it!',5
'So the BF and I went here tonight with the BFs mom and dad for his moms birthday. Shes a vegetarian and had heard good things about this place but the rest of us are not vegetarians. So first off this place has a very cult ish feel. The workers all seem like theyre in a daze and they play a video talking about the grand master. Whoa.   Anyway so you go up to the counter to order. I got the spicy cha cha due to the overwhelming popularity of this dish on yelp BF accidently ordered the family bean curd (he meant to order sweet and sour but gave the wrong number his mom go the S&S and his dad got the burger. They gave us a weird cup of soup before we got our meal. It had the consistency of egg drop.... it was pretty low on flavor but was the best thing I had there.   First off when we looked at the menu it said a side of rice cost 1$ but we were charged 2$ for each side of rice... wtf. Second my food was terrible. Maybe I overlooked it but on the menu it says that this dish is yam protein. I thought I like yams... this was not anything like a yam. It was fake shrimp! WTF why doesnt the menu say imitation shrimp? I hate shrimp! maybe it was my fault... but seriously wtf. The meat had the consistency of shrimp (gross) and a weird flavor that still lingers in my mouth hours later. It was dry and had no sauce plus it wasnt spicy. Its called spicy cha cha..... I ate a couple of the fake shrimps but that was all I could eat. The BFs was also pretty bad. It was mushy and flavorless. Supposedly the sweet and sour was good but I didnt try it.   So his mom liked the food and that was the point of going here but that does not mean that I have to give it a good rating. I would not go here again.... or at least until the next time BFs mom wants to go... but Id definitely get something different.',1
'Great Scott steak! Amazing bread soaked in melted butter and topped with marinated onions.  Mashed potatoes that will learn you! Very good food and service. Make sure you get the gift card off of Restaurants.com great food and great savings!',4
'Was craving a hamburger and popped into Modern Burger at Fashion Square. I was disappointed only sliders were available at the modern burger so went to their full restaurant next door at Modern Steak.  Somewhat pricey for lunch but great atmosphere.    We sat outside and I ordered the kobe burger and a salad.  Was very good and loved the bacon on top of it.',4
'I have been to Tee Pee three times and keep going back. Its a little pricey and crowded but a good dive-like Mexican food place for dine-in. I am surprised how many low ratings they have on Yelp maybe people were expecting something fancy? TRY THE CHEESEBURGER. I know I know why would you get a burger at a Mexican food joint? But its HUGE and really good.',4
'If you think youve arrived at a warehouse and might get mugged in the parking lot you know youre about to have an amazing meal.  The food is authentic the flavors are delicious... Everything Ive tried is fresh and tasty.  Eggplant gai lan fried fish fish soup green beans scallion pancakes vegetable lo mean mapo tofu... All delicious.   And they deliver!',5
'I went here this past Sunday afternoon after reading a bunch of reviews on Yelp.  The place wasnt terribly crowded when my girlfriend and I arrived and we had the option of sitting either at the bar or at one of the small tables (we sat at a table).  The two guys who seemed to be running the place were both very nice and friendly.    I ordered the chicken enchiladas and eggs and my girlfriend ordered the turkey rellenos and eggs.  I absolutely loved my dish and thought it was a great value for the price ($12).  I was less enthusiastic about the rellenos but that is because Im just not a fan of rellenos generally.  I would generally describe our meals as brunch with a kick which is exactly what we were looking for.    The only reason that I might be reluctant to come here again is that I am new to the area and I just like to try different places for the sake of trying different places.  Also its about a 20 minute drive from Tempe;  as someone previously living in  DC i am more used to walking to the places i want to eat.  But if i lived nearby i would probably go every week.',4
'I dont know if they just had an off night if I ordered the wrong thing (the red chili plate) or if their quality of food has deteriorated; but I was sorely disappointed during my last visit. Ive always liked the atmosphere at the other Los Dos better (I mean come on the red chili plate is aka chile colorado at any other Mexican restaurant) but at least the food used to be good. This last time the food was bland the tortillas were greasy I could have gotten better guacamole at Chipotle and the poppers were store bought (yes I know dumb mistake- they just sounded good at the time). My recommendations: try the green chile plate (aka chile verde at any other Mexican restaurant). Try the other Los Dos the one off Central. Or maybe try some other place.',2
'This is a great place to get lunch if you work in the area. Tons of lunch specials for under $7. I got a meal with sushi soup salad orange slices and egg rolls. The waitress was extremely nice and helpful! I will go back soon!',3
'Had a Reuben. Not a Reuben. Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut. Very little thousand island dressing. Marble bread not a strong rye flavor. Corned beef was bland too. Very very bland. Im from Omaha NE. born and raised where the Reuben was invented. Im also Irish. This is more of whats called a Rachel Reuben except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey. A Reuben should have a sour and tang stink a bit. Disappointed. Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me.',1
'LOVE this place!  This is the place to go for any music equipment.  They even have weekend guitar lessons for free.  Also they will price match with any competitor.    I understand it can be kind of intimidating to talk to the staff.  They are like the Genius Bar of the music world.  But they really are just there to help you.    I buy all of my guitars and equipment from here.  I always receive a follow up email about a week after purchase just checking up and making sure I like the product.   Thats top notch customer service.',5
'Shimogamo has been one of my favorites for a few years now so i thought it was time to give them a YELP!  Every time I visit I am always greeted by the owner (Yoshi) who happens to be Japanese and runs the restaurant as such. Fish is always fresh and consistently high quality sushi chefs are friendly and always willing to let you try something new. They also have a nice selection of cold sakes available and some random ones in stock off the menu if you ask the owner.    Atmosphere is very modern/contemporary and in a small suite located next to C-Fu Gourmet. They also have a traditional Japanese seating room in the back that is fun for larger groups etc.. If you are a sushi lover or even a newbie to this style you will love it!',4
'We found this place on yelp like we usually do and I must say what a bizarre little joint in the afternoon. Its off the beaten path but I think it was definitely created and designed for a night time experience which would make it off the hook; but for lunch I felt like I was at a club in the Castro. The décor was all white with chairs on one side of the table and reclining benches on the other.  The bathrooms are an absolute mystery:  Theres is the mens room womens room and coed bathroom (probably a lot of fun at night ;).  Inside the restrooms they are entirely mirrors with little lighting except for the tvs that are on.  Its almost hard to find your way out.  My husband said there was 80s porn on in his bathroom.  I digress...The food and drinks were VERY TASTY.  We started with the Hell Chips which would be a total superbowl favorite: homemade salty chips with blue cheese and buffalo wing sauce.  I had the bartender make me a virgin gimlet which was delicious (pregnant at the time) and my husband has something that was served in a copper cup.  Excellent mixologists.  My husband also had a delicious burger and I had a generously portioned salad that I was unable to finish.  This place is definitely quirky but great service and excellent food = 5 stars in my book.  Ill have to go back at night and when Im not pregnant.',5
'Disgusting.  Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so have you ever been so revolted you couldnt finish the roll?  I hope you havent. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance.   While the decor is amazing the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home the love affair stops there. Its all superficial and I dont date that type.',1
'Restaurant was absolutely packed on a Thursday night.  We found our way to the hostess station and was informed the wait was 90 minutes.  Normally this would make me crazy and would never consider waiting that long but fortunately the bar was the perfect place to hang out drink and socialize while waiting.  At the 35 minute mark we were offered our table.  I guess the idea is to under promise and over deliver.  Every employee we encountered was friendly and made us feel welcome despite what a madhouse the place was.  The remodel is spot on as most of the original building has been transformed.    On an unrelated note beware of the speed trap along Gilbert road.  We were seated at a street side patio table and watched a motorcycle cop pulling people over one after the other.  The speed limit is 25mph and it seems the Gilbert PD takes the speed limit very seriously.',5
'= = = = = =  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE WEEKDAY LUNCH BUFFET  = = = = = =   The last time I was here I told owner Bobby that I thought this place needed a little tune up & only gave it 3 Stars.  He Yelped me recently inviting me to drop in this month and take advantage of their August $8.95 Lunch Buffet Special and to see what I think of the improvements he said they have made.  Wow Ill say!  This place ROCKED today!  I started with help-yourself super tasty Mango Lassi then they brought my choice of 3 flavors of hot toasty Naan bread plain buttered & my choice garlic.  Yum!  Over on the serving tables they had 34 food items out plus sauces & dressings.  This is a Super Buffet for in Indian place especially for a weekday!  Some of what I enjoyed was Tomato Soup salad with various fruits & veggies Balsamic Rice Chicken Curry Chicken Tikki Masala Tandoori Chicken Aloo Pakoras Vegetable Samosa Achari Chicken Aloo Gobhi Aloo Tamatal Nauratan Vindau Plalk Paneer Daal Makhni Gaigan Bharta Paneer Tikki Masala & so on plus great desserts.  All of this represented TERRIFIC Indian cooking!  There wasnt ANYTHING that I could say was better somewhere else.  On top of that the table service was good and there was a wide selection of CHINA plates & bowls from which to choose.  No eating out of nasty little styrofoam things or burning your fingers carrying handle-less steel cups!  So is this now actually Indian PARADISE?  Pretty much!!     :-))  August Weekday Lunch Buffet:  $8.95  New lower regular price $10.95.',5
'Every time I go to PHX now I have to stop at this place! It is so good and such a steal for sushi. I can gorge myself in sushi for only $12. It is definitely a new favorite its nothing like fresh sushi from California but it is still delicious.',5
'Was out in Tempe for a conference and wanted to find some Mexican close to our hotel. We found this place. We got the guacamole which was awesome they put some jalapeno sauce around the edge which was might tasty.   Portions werent that big but prices were reasonable. Service was great and would definitely come back next time I was in Tempe.',4
'hell yeah!  I just ate a muffin with whipped butter thats as big as my head!  jerk chicken with sweet potato was great.  baked potato was as big as a football.  they need to test the food here for some serious growth hormones...',4
'Love love love the croissants! They melt in your mouth and are wonderful.. Service sucks and so does there coffee.. Most of the time all I want for breakfast is a croissant and coffee but the coffee is god awful. Will always go back for that croissant though!',3
'Oh. My. Goodness.  The food from these guys is insanely good!  I stumbled upon them via GrubHub. I was looking for a departure from the same old same-old and wow did I ever take the right path!  Being vegetarian I decided to try the spinach hand pie and the veggie greek hand pie. Also I had never heard of this grain called farro so I tried that too.  YUM. YUM. YUM!  The food was delivered much sooner than anticipated the price was good and the food.....I actually called one of the owners - something I have never done before - to tell him how amazingly good the food was.  TRY THIS FOOD!  You will not be disappointed.',5
'Well folks froyo is typically froyo and i found nothing bad about the actually yogurt and fruits.  What did strike me as being curious and warranting two stars is an offensive flavor.  the white boy vanilla sure they may be trying to be funny but it is in poor taste children love froyo and i am sure they inquire mommy what is white boy vanilla? if they had a similar name for a chocolate or banana flavor i am sure they would have the ACLU boycotting the place.',2
'You get what you pay for. Very expensive.',5
'California Club... That is all.',5
'This place has some pretty darn good yogurt. It is another place where they dont let you get your own samples but other than that not bad. They have a great selection of toppings too.',5
'Home away from home for me sometimes.',4
'Overall this is a very adequate hotel. Not the Ritz not Holiday Inn. Not priced like either. The hotel staff is one of the friendliest helpful and accommodating that I have found. The room I had was fairly priced for this time of year in PHX. It was clean spacious comfortable bed. Very adequate. The room working desk charging stations were convenient and useful. There is nothing much to complain about EXCEPT: the $14.95/day Internet connection and the nearly $25/day valet parking is high priced. The valet parking price is competitive with the area and a guest has an option of self parking. So that I can live with. The Internet cost is excessive and although I needed it I bought only one days service of a four night trip - strictly because of the cost. This cost should be bundled with the room. It cant possibly cost that much to bring Internet service to 31 floors of rooms. Its one of those costs like hotel Service Fees that drive guests crazy. If half of the 1500 rooms bought internet service on the day i did the hotel revenue increased more than $10000 for one night! The hotel is located downtown across the street from the AZ Center which include a Starbucks. This is good hotel that seemed to be very busy. Kudos to the staff - nice job!',4
'Of all the times Ive eaten at Switch I cant believe I havent written a review yet!  Switch is our Sunday Brunch.  We love the place.  The ambiance is great! We love the paintings on the walls.  We usually get a table next to the window along Central Ave. and its great to watch the world go by while you dine with those you adore!  For me thats my lovely wife.   Ive sampled quite a bit of the menu at Switch.  The Red Sangria is amazing as are the crepes.  We love the seafood crepes and the Ham and Cheese crepes as well.  Ive also had the cowboy burger which is quite good and the French Dip is incredible also.  Lately weve fallen in love with the fruit and cheese plate.  The fig jam is AMAZING! (edit: I forgot the candied walnuts!  How could I forget the candied walnuts?  You gotta try the candied walnuts!) :-)  Whether there are just a couple of you or a whole group Switch can accommodate.  The only thing Id change about Switch would be not to charge extra if you want to switch something like fries for the Caesar salad.  But thats just a personal preference.  Good Stuff here!',4
'Walked in on a Friday morning to eat breakfast for 4. Ordered build your own omelette huevos rancheros burger and chicken and waffles. Reviews from the family were quite positive with top marks for the coffee and the fries. Overall pretty decent little spot.',4
'Sleepy Dog Brewery is a great place to hang out with some friends.  We recently had a large group go in and the staff was quick and fast about it all!  Love the different food trucks available during the evenings.   Take note though no one under 21.',4
'Im very displeased with the service I receive from the Republican party in Arizona.  First they provide us with John McCain.  Then Jan Brewer.  Then they crap SB 1070 all over us which we didnt even vote on.  Ive never received anything but lousy politics from these people.',1
'Had the schnitzel with hot pepper gravy spatzle and red cabbage. Loved it except the cabbage. They didnt do anything wrong I just dont like cabbage. I liked the place and thankfully didnt have to drive to glendale for my German fix. Had a couple nice German Oktoberfest beers to boot.',4
'What I love about this place:  You can submit an order online and go pick it up without having to wait in the long lunch line!  Thank god for the internet.  The staff is efficient for the most part.  The sandwiches are made to order and they have outdoor seating.  Its close to where I work so I come here often.',4
'This place nails it on every level. Sorry to see that some  foodies dont agree but hey its Phoenix...',5
'This place is fun and unique.  Although the food is... well.... not all that healthy its a great place to go for an occasional outing.  A must see!',4
'I love this place.  Super awesome dive bar.  With karaoke!',5
'Soooo many sandwiches to choose from.  Theres 60 different choices.  Try the black bean patty!  Its yummy!',5
'My wife and I ate at the restaurant with two friends.  We all had good times eating and talking.  We were there for almost three hours.  The food was good.  The prices was very reasonable.  We were there to celebrate my Birthday.  The only thing is that the waitress was not happy to be there and to serve us.  She looked grumpy.  I think that the restaurant needs to educate their waitresses and waiters about the Joy of Serving the Customers.  I would recommend this restaurant as long as the waitress is happy and everything would be fine.',4
'Ive been here for happy hour a few times its always decent.    I brought a client in for lunch today...  Great Fajitas!    Enough said...',4
'This place was gross the review b4 me must have been the last time they CLEANED. The employees were just as rude they sat my hubby and I at a dirty booth and the food was gross plus they got the order wrong. Do yourself a favor dont come here :))',1
'This place is hit or miss. You see I have strict rules when shopping: buy nothing at full price. So sometimes when the stars align just so I find some pretty amazing deals on the sales racks. But you have to carve some time into your day to shop these racks for there are several of them scattered through the store. I typically walk in and make a sharp right turn.   Last time I was here I bought 3 new shirts/pseudo-jackets for $30. Ya cant beat that especially when you get staple items that lend themselves to mixing-and-matching. So in that sense I love this place. Yet finding these rare finds is well rare. Mostly I find I cant fathom the idea of wearing 100% polyester or spandex blends in Hells Armpit (Phoenix). I want cotton damnit. Is that too much to ask?',3
'Terrible experience. The server was a snot turned up his nose when I had a question about the menu and rolled his eyes several times during our visit. We started with tapas-a mix of three different dishes: albondigas spanish tortilla and an empanada. They were ok probably pre-made and just warmed up as we ordered. I got the pork dish which was mostly just fat and gristle. It was basically inedible. The rice and beans were mediocre and flavorless. Way too expensive for low quality food.   Bad quality food high prices rude servers... I definitely do not plan on returning.',1
'This is a neat hangout for craft beer people and slightly alternative people. I like the architecture the decor and the pool table (although I did not play). The beer list is impressive if youre into that. There does seem to be a significant emphasis on beer lifestyle. My husband and I went for Birthday Suit Burlesque on Friday Sept. 21. The reason Im giving it 3 stars is because the bartenders could have been a lot friendlier and customer service is a big deal to me. We also found it tough to find a decent place to sit/stand to see the stage unobscured. We watched most of the performances on the monitor behind the bar. I really liked that the monitor was there but it seemed to cheapen the experience it was like watching the girls on a security camera. Although I originally felt that I was among like-minded individuals my husband and I got a lot of prolonged stares and then I felt like the place was really clique-y and probably not very hospitable to outsiders. The drink specials made it relatively painless for us to drink there. We stayed for about an hour (even after paying the $6 cover) and left feeling underwhelmed by the show.',3
'Happy Hour is from 4-7 pm.... highly recommended.  Sushi is on average about 30% off and I ordered 3 main courses plus 2 appetizers. It was delicious and I was absolutely stuffed- obviously. Ate it all California Rolls Shrimp Tempura Spring rolls etc...Service was alright kind of had to give her the wave whenever something was needed. Her friends were sitting at the table next to us as we heard their entire conversation pretty well. They chatted and chatted and chatted. The price was perfect but it was happy hour otherwise it is quite expensive.',3
'Hiking Camelback is tough work. I am proud to say I climbed it a few times this spring.   But it kicks my butt. With that said  be careful out there   people. I am so shocked to see people who have no business being up there  up there.   And please if your toddler is crying as you drag them up maybe you should rethink the outing a bit.  It looks like others have given their  hiking tips. My thoughts are if you have knee problems  feet problems or joint problems you may not feel it at the beginning but you will.You will be up at the top huffing and puffing realizing you bit off more than you chew. Have fun but be wise.',4
'My husband and I live down the street from this place and finally decided to try it.  Blech never again.  The server Tammy was great!  In fact the staff is really nice.  Its sad to see such great people working at a place that will probably shut down in a month or two.  My husband ordered the Fireball burger and said that there was no kick whatsoever.  I ordered the Pigskin burger.  I ordered it well done and while it was completely charred on the outside (bad) there was still pink on the inside.  I work in a restaurant and I know how it should look.  There is supposed to be bacon in the meat mixture could not taste it at all.  In fact the burger as a whole did not have any flavor to it.  Wendys burgers have more flavor!  The onion rings are really good!  In fact the best Ive had yet.  The fries are good too they lightly sprinkle some seasoning salt on them (so don t add salt!).  My husband really liked his bloody mary.    The other con was that other than us there was one other table and our food still took a long time to come out.    We wont go back.  The food is unimpressive and there are other places I can spend my tips.',2
'Amazing Bears Bar with a true Chicago feel. Excellent bar selection and great service. The highlight is definitely the entertainment. Darts pool video games and SO MANY TELEVISIONS! This is THE place to watch football.',5
'While everything on the menu is fantastic I go for the Gyro (Yee-roo). It is and I have explored Gyros across Phoenix the BEST!  The place is clean and the music depends on the combination of who is working there that day. If George and Z his friend co-owner and cook are on you get an easy mix of classic rock and contemporary pop. If Geroges father is working with George you will get Greek music (which I love...stay long enough for the theme to Zorba the Greek). If Georges father and Z are there you get a mix of everything.  With the police station across the street lunchtime is crowded but safe. Off hours is easy and the wait isnt long.  Friendly and very reasonably priced with specials posted that one should not ignore. I hear great things about the chili. One day I will order a Chili Gyro. They may look at me for a moment but they will make one and probably add it to the menu.  Friendly and great service. Become a regular and youre part of the family. Opa!  4/20/11 - Sigh! I stopped at Georges on my way out of town moving back east. My last meal so to speak and I have yet to find the equal anywhere. So dear diners enjoy the fine fare at Georges because you may have no idea how rare the place really is.  At this point Im ready to ask him to FedEx me a dozen Gyros... not that I would freeze any of them. I would just sit on the floor and roll around on them naked. Well maybe not... but I would eat them all in one sitting!',5
'You want to know how old I am?  I was here when this opened.    (Story time) I was in grade school.  I was SO excited because the only other library in North Phoenix before this one was built was (and I kid you not) a green and white one room mobile trailer on 32nd street near Thunderbird.  As a voracious reader Id pretty much burned through the entire kids section and a good chunk of the adult section by the time this new library was built when I was 10.  We watched it being built and Oooo-d and Aaaaaa-d over its super modern architecture.  I was so excited that Mom let me miss school for the day to be there for the opening ceremonies where speeches were made about progress in Phoenix and Rose Moffard cut the bright red ribbon.  It was amazing.    Though its gone through an expansion since then its surprising how small this library seems now in comparison to the mega-mart libraries that have sprouted up in other parts of town.  Its gone from being THE library in the area to one of the smaller libraries in the general area.  Its still a great neighborhood library though.  That super modern architecture is still holding its own pretty well against the new fancy locations.  And the fact that it is a part of the Paradise Valley Mall circle of shops is really convenient.',5
'I found Papaya Thai by looking around yelp for restaurants that deliver in Tempe.  Our food came pretty fast - within 30 min.  And it was awesome...  We had the Tom Yum soup with Chx to start and it was probably my favorite part of the meal.  I also had the Green Curry with pork which was also a very good curry as good as i have had at other Thai places in town.  My boyfriend had the Pad Thai.  He liked it but it was a little too sweet for me.  Plus they forgot the peanuts.    I will keep this place on my regular rotation for deliveries.  The delivery guy had some very enthusiastic suggestions when I asked him what to order next time: Blue Sapphire Basil Drunken Noodle and Phad-See-Ew.',4
'Great pedicure in a nice clean shop.  Reasonable price too.',5
'Been to Cibo several times and have had no problems with the food but what I dont go out to dinner for is a flat out RUDE server. My room mates and I went to Cibo on a thursday night and got right in as we chose to sit inside i.e.. the place was not swamped as it is on a weekend night. We waited so long to even be helped in the first place that had to finally ask someone if we HAD a server as we would liked to have ordered a bottle of wine. When we ordered apps as we couldnt pronounce what we wanted we pointed it out on the menu to the server so she clearly saw it. However when an antipasti platter came out and we said that wasnt our order the food runner took it back to our server who brought it back out to us and continued to argue with us that we did in fact order the antipasti which we hadnt. Our pizza took so long we actually had time to finish the bottle of wine and could have fallen over if wed gotten any eye contact or mention of our pizza and where it may have gone. I dont care how amazing the food or how popular the restaurant servers with poor attitudes are never worth the time and money.',2
'Recently had our Christmas Party at the resort there were 1200 of us and the level of service we received was beyond outstanding.  The food was incredible I have never had a steak cook to perfection and delivered to the table warm and tender especially with the number of people that we had.  The service was outstanding.',5
'Was great for the last few visits. Recently the meat selection has gotten fatty and sub par from what it was. I ordered a pastrami sandwich when I removed the top portion of the bread 1/8 of this sandwich had large amounts of fat trimmings. I went 1 more time later in the month and ordered the beef brisket sandwich. Again more than 1/8 of the meat was covered in fat.  The service is great people are friendly and the place is very clean and I enjoy the other selections that this place has to offer However; it is way to expensive to be serving this type of quality!',3
'i have ordered To-Go... alot! and ate in... i love it!!  its a little red house.. you cant miss it... Im pretty sure its family run... and its a cozy little place... the sweet and sour chicken/pork is great!!   i always go for their lunch specials.. its no more than about $7 total...  and you get a lot of food!! you get their soup ... then the entree!  i always get their sweet and sour chicken or pork... a nice sized helping of egg fried rice.. chicken and bell peppers big chunks of pineapple onions in just the right amount of S&S sauce... a spring roll... its sooo good... and these little fried won tons.. so yummy...   if you get take out.. you get all of it but the soup.. but thats alright :) when you get take out you always get more food stacked in the box :) yum!   this is a great lunch spot down town :) its a hidden treasure...',5
'After having read Chris Bs review and then seeing them later the next day at the Wednesday evening Phoenix Market I decided to give them a try.   Initially looking and the Cajun Steak Jamburrito after talking to the chef I decided to just go with the Cajun Steak Jambalaya bowl ($5.99). While waiting I was given a hush puppy to sample...light and crispy just like I like em.  Contemplating getting an order I figured it would be too much food.   I received my bowl of savory rice mixed with some veggies like peas corn carrot topped with a portion of spicy steak and some slices of sausage.  It was very much comfort food.  I did have to put a generous sprinkle of hot sauce to add a touch more heat and flavor but it was a very welcome addition.   While it didnt knock my socks or wow me it reminded me of a few things I whip up at home now and again. I left content full and happy I tried a new food truck.',3
'Being so close to this place I couldnt pass up checking it out.  It is on a street that looks like it could be only residential homes so it can be easily missed.  However this is one place you dont want to drive by without stopping in!    They had a live band and place was crowded from wall to wall.  We got lucky and a group left from the room facing the street.  The art that flooded the place were all local artists which made it that much better.  It is definitely a hip bar so dont walk in with your heels on lady..things could get weird. =)  The bar is SUPER tiny with only 2-3 stools and two bar tenders avoiding stepping on each other with each filled order.    They dont serve hard liquor here so it will be wine or beer....which is A-OK with  me!  They have a fairly decent wine selection so you wont feel too limited.  I didnt pay a whole lot of attention to the band.  To be honest I think I was 3 glasses of wine by this time. :-p  The patio outside was pretty cool it was like someones backyard.  I love the character of this bar its much different than anything offered in Scottsdale.  Great experience !   Im looking forward to going back on First Friday.',4
'From what I heard and read about Pizzeria Bianco I was expecting Pizza Of The Gods - not kind of okay pizza.  My boyfriend and I had spent the day in downtown Phoenix and decided to give Bianco a try. We got there a little after 4 and were 12 and 13th in like respectively (it was a weekday.) We were in the first group seated which was a relief after the August heat.  Although I was braced for serious rudeness the service was polite and one of the waiters was willing to take a moment to explain the menu which I appreciated.  We ordered the Margherita and the Rosa. The Margherita wasnt bad. I mean it was cheese pizza with some basil leaves. Edible certainly but by no means a revelation. The Rosa on the other hand was awash in olive oil. It was massively greasy almost to the point of being inedible.  I dont know if it was the people in the building or the building itself but the acoustics were terrible - my boyfriend and I could barely hear each other.  In all honesty Ive had much  more pleasant dining experiences at Buca De Bepo and Oreganos. So much for the best pizza on the west coast.',2
'Great staff without an attitude (which is rare in Scottsdale).  As I was waiting for my party to arrive I was sitting outside drinking my beer and eating my food.  Without ANY questions and/or hassle my bill was transferred inside when my party arrived.  Not only that but our waiter remember exactly what I had and was able to split it without me even asking him to do so.  OK how great is that?  I am totally sold on the service there an  I will definitely come back.  Very nice unpretentious place.',5
'My cousin and I visited Carrabbas after spending all day at the Aji Spa. For a Friday night the restaurant was empty so we got seated right away. The bread and olive oil (with seasonings) they served at the beginning was just the thing to get my already hungry appetite going even more.  I ordered the Mezzaluna: half moon ravioli stuffed with chicken ricotta and spinach in a tomato cream sauce. It was quite tasty and filling! My cousin ordered the Chicken Marsala: grilled chicken breast topped with mushrooms prosciutto and wine marsala sauce. That marsala sauce was scrumptious!!!!  I would have been happy eating the fresh bread with that mushroom marsala sauce!   We were too full for dessert but its definitely a place that I wouldnt mind returning to. The service was good food was yummy and affordable and I have no complaints. Yay for Carrabbas!',3
'The Sale Cellar is an Arizona institution and is one of a kind. I take colleagues from out of town there for business dinners regularly and they usually ask to go back when they return to town.   Make sure to get the Shrimp San Remo appetizer. If youre having a hard time deciding on an an entree stick to the specials as its always fresh.',4
'Just what Chandlers growing downtown area needs a country bar!    First round review at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon probably isnt a good gauge of how Bourbon Jacks operates for weekend nightlife however we went for some food and to take a look-see at the vibe and to determine whether it was worth it to come back.  The bar is wedged in a narrow space off Boston and Arizona Ave in downtown Chandler park in the gravel lot behind the buildings across from the City of Chandler building. Its a long narrow bar with super neato exposed brick to one side and rustic wooden bar on the other. The reviews from others about the atmosphere are pretty spot on. See pictures too.  My husband ordered the pulled pork sandwich and I ordered the corn bread and bowl of chicken chili. His sandwich looked pretty decent he said not the best hes had but pretty darn good. The corn bread was served in a tin about the size of a dessert plate with a side of the most delicious orange sweet butter ever! I would definitely recommend an order to split with your table. The chili was very tasty not spicy but had very good flavor depth little pieces of pickled jalapeno and onion sprinkled on top really rounded out the overall taste.  We both ordered the Lumberjack IPA a hoppy beer in 20 oz glass cost $7 - wish we were there for happy hour!  Our server was FANTASTIC! I wish I knew her name because she was so genuinely friendly and helpful. The whole staff was very nice.  The bands play a Wednesday-Saturday according to our server anywhere from 8pm-1am mostly a mix of country with a little bit of classic rock also according to our server.   We will definitely be back!',4
'The menu states that they have been voted best breakfast lunch and dinner nearly every year since approx 2001 for the Fountain Hills area this is why I went.  Are these folks flying in from third world countries because my palate experience was bar food. The Coca Cola Products Collection cluttered throughout the restaurant was more appealing than the food. If you are looking for a filler or something with large portions for 8-12 bucks go here for average food. The fact that they were voted best of any meal should be a slap in the face to other restaurants in the area who work hard to present quality cuisine to the residents of the Fountain Hills.  They get 3 stars for being average what a let down.',3
'Bruschetta is amazing!',5
'Doesnt look like much on the outside or even on the inside for that matter.  Almost left the restaurant actually because we were scared of what was to come. Glad we stayed though! We both ordered pho...and it was sooo good!! Better than the other pho place I went to in this area. This is a small family owned restaurant and our waitress didnt speak much english but she gave us great service! Will go back again.',4
'Excellent!!!  Had the chicken on the coop potato leek pancakes and huevos rancheros.  Will definitely be coming back.',5
'Been here a few times and was never disappointed and then I always wonder why Im not here more often. Its a great place but not that memorable at least not to me. They do a great job at what they do and their food has always been fantastic. The place has an eclectic crowd and service can be spotty at times especially when theyre packed. All in all its one of the better dining options in the area and thats something to be thankful for.',4
'Just walking to the front door got me excited; there are outside picnic benches so your ankle-biters can run around out there and not bother me as I dine inside!  Woo hoo!  I had imagined more of a sit-down & order kind of place but I support ordering and picking up your food at the counter so there arent waitstaff hovering around.  (Nothing against waiters I just prefer a more casual environment!)  And casual inviting atmosphere they have.  The young lady working the register was one of the nicest people Ive ever interacted with.  The food was exactly what I hoped for: fresh and flavorful.  I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad with tasty mixed greens roasted poblano peppers and lots of other good stuff mixed in.  Sure my food was ready fast but this isnt your typical fast food pile of iceburg lettuce!  If you have time afterward (and its not too hot) take a stroll around the place admire the flowers and plants maybe even pick up some fruits for veggies they have for sale out back!  Its on the honor system!',4
'Great fish tacos great service and great prices.',4
'First yes the waitresses were beautiful even on a Monday night.  Drinks were average at best...lots very dark Jack & Cokes.   Food was terrible.  Frozen pizza appetizer was the lowlight.  Highlight was the what seemed to be homemade potato chips.  They were nice. 2 stars for the outfits but no stars for service.  Had our waitress had more of a personality we may have stayed longer.  But weak drinks bad food and poor service are not a good combination. Oh and add in the creepy guys who were there eating by themselves and not a good situation.  Made me long for Hooters...(OK that part isnt true.)',1
'Been there 3 times.  Like the location as well as the food.  It proves that people that are younger then me and hip still appreciate great food. Not a big fan or oriental food but I love this place.  The portions are substantial.  I have enjoyed taking friends there and have them think I am nuts for taking them there on the way in and having them thank me on the way out.  If you want to step out of the norm and have some great food this is the place for you.',4
'Everado took our family pictures and he was fantastic! Professional creative and receptive to our ideas as well.  We had an 11 month old with us and he was so patient and understanding.  He worked hard to get great shots and the pictures turned out really good.  Thank you for making this a wonderful experience!',5
'I wanted to go out for a hike and to shoot some wildflowers and thought Id try this place.  Good thing I brought my wallet!  I wasnt expecting the $6.00 fee!  Thats the only thing I didnt like about it.  At least for the money the park ranger did point out where I would find the best flowers for pictures.    It was nice and quiet outside.  The grounds were beautiful and clean.  I also hiked the Go John trail.  I would definitely come back but not as often as I would without the cost!',4
'Awesome place if you want to almost get hit by a car. An 8 year old can put together a more functional parking area.',2
'Great Bike shop. Gives that warm & Fuzzy feel.',5
'It has been a couple of months since my wedding and Im finally getting around to reviewing our various wedding vendors. This will be the first of the wedding reviews because out of all the businesses we worked with I am most excited to share our wonderful experience with Dennis at The Goldsmith!  We bought my engagement ring and both of our wedding bands here. When my husband proposed he surprised me with a beautiful star ring (I love stars!) that we call the proposal ring so that we could go to pick out the actual engagement ring together. The Goldsmith came highly recommended to us by both my now mother-in-law and one of my husbands close family friends so even though it was nearly an hour away we decided to go there.    The Goldsmith is a one-man shop. Dennis is the owner and he has been a jeweler and goldsmith for more than 35 years. He previously worked as a wholesale jeweler at mall jewelry stores where he saw firsthand how diamonds are marked up. At The Goldsmith you are dealing directly with the owner who is dealing directly with the diamond seller so there arent any crazy markups and Dennis definitely passes the savings on.  We called ahead to let him know our price range and when we arrived to our appointment he already had a stunning diamond ready to show us. He was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic and he answered all of our questions. He told us all about ideal cut hearts and arrows diamonds the only diamonds he sells. I will be the first to say that I had no idea what ideal cut or hearts and arrows meant. Of the 4 Cs everyone talks about I probably understood cut the least. I thought it just meant shape - round princess marquise and so on. If youre in the same boat just do a quick online search for ideal cut hearts and arrows diamond and you will see that there is so much more to cut. The best cut equals the most sparkle! And I like sparkle!   An ideal cut diamond is one that is specially cut to ideal proportions - the exact mathematical angles that create the maximum refraction of light. Hearts and arrows refers to the visual pattern that you see when you view an ideal cut diamond from above which he was happy to let us take a peek at. Ideal cut hearts and arrow diamonds are considered to be the most beautiful diamonds in the world. They are more work to cut so they are rare. They actually account for less than 1% of all diamonds.   Next came picking out the setting. Dennis has many catalogs and countless options. While you dont get to actually touch and see them all the photos in the catalogs are very detailed. No matter what youre looking for you will find something you love. Plus you can be assured that your ring will be a lot more unique than if you went shopping at a corporate chain. At the same time if youre like me too many options can become overwhelming. But no worries! Dennis is there to help. After paging through a catalog and not loving what I was seeing I described to him what I was looking for and within a few minutes he located a setting in one of the catalogs that was exactly what I had described.   We were so lucky to have heard about The Goldsmith. We are young and poor but even we were able to afford an incredibly gorgeous engagement ring and wedding bands. If we had gone to the mall or a chain we would have paid a lot more and ended up with a less brilliant diamond. When we took my ring to be appraised it was valued at far above our paying price. Seriously. When we told the appraiser what we had paid for the ring they could not believe what a great deal we got on such a high quality product.   We have only gone to Dennis for engagement ring and wedding bands but in addition to diamonds Dennis also offers colored gemstones gem remounting jewelry and watch repair and custom jewelry design services. Both my mother-in-law and our family friend have gone to him time and time again for these other services and have been nothing but pleased. Dennis takes pride in his craft and truly cares about his customers. I would recommend him to anyone!',5
'Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 9 Food 8 Service 9 Atmosphere 10 Value  I love this spot.  Since you pay per ounce you can enjoy a tiny taste or you can pound a gallon of gurt.  Ive always gotten my fill and never spent more than $4.  The toppings selection is excellent and the yogurt flavors are good (their seasonal Pumpkin Spice w/ cheesecake chunks is my current favorite).  They recently scaled back their hours a bit :( but I hope that gets reversed as 44 Monroe finishes filling up Concord Eastridge builds their apartments and CityScape puts apartments on its hotel.',5
'The Birthday Cake Castle is now open for tours.  Having grown up in Phoenix and just down the street from the castle I had many grandios ideas about the castle.  I was fortunate enough to tour the castle this year when it opened.  It is a great tour however it is my reservation only.  Call now for a tour next year as they are booked up through the year.  It is a must see tour when coming to the valley.',4
'Really great family restaurant. Prices are reasonable and the salsa is terrific!',5
'Great place to take kids! Live where there is no drive-ins and always wanted to have my kids go to one. This place was wonderful and cheap. Dont go on a hot summer night! Great prices $6 per person on a Saturday night two movies! Tuesdays during the summer 2011 is $4.50 per person. Great deal.',4
'I was craving a gyro and went to yelp to help me give me some ideas. Due to all the great comments about the food I had made my decision and decided to try it out for myself. Well.... very happy I did. Food was great! Lots of meat and the salad was delicious! Although the place is not very pretty to look at the food is well worth it. Whats even better its super close to my house. I will definitely be going back!',5
'I came here with my fiances family for dinner and a little casual celebration.  The food was fantastic and the service was good.  The only down side is that the place is a bit noisy and a little crowded.  People kept bumping into my chair as they passed and while its not overly loud forget about holding a quiet private conversation.  I had one of their specials that day a shrimp ravioli which was exceptional with nice sized pieces of shrimp cut up into the sauce.  The chef seems to really know what hes doing.',4
'My review will be for the Grooming site within this Petco location. I took my dog into Petco Grooming for the second time to be groomed and the appointment was at 2pm. I thought Id shop the store and wait for my dog during her appointment. It couldnt take more than 45 minutes to an hour right? Nope! Once I was done shopping around the store I went to check the progress of the groom. The groomer was gone and I could see my dog in a kennel waiting to be serviced. Also my dog is a rescue and is afraid of being in a kennel cage crate. I continued to wait and the groomer returned at 3pm. She said Oh have you been waiting the entire time? A groom takes two to three hours. I wasnt sure how to respond because I was upset but I didnt want her to know and then rush through the groom or accidentally clip my dog. I asked her when she thought shed be done and she said Im off at 4 so shell be done by then. Ok shed be done in AN HOUR.  I headed home without my dog at 3pm and then had to return at 4pm when the initial appointment was at 2. I thought it was ridiculous for the groomer to schedule an appointment clearly during her lunch break. Sheesh!!!  All in all she did an ok job on the groom. I would give a lower star rating for the grooming portion because of the lack of customer service but Ill return to the store because other Petco employees were fantastic and helpful. Its too bad because the first time I visited the Petco groomers last June it was such a positive experience its close to home and reasonably priced. Ill visit this Petco again but I will be seeking a new groomer. Bad scheduling and bad customer service speaks volumes.',3
'Ive been itching to go to FEZ for a long time based on all the other wonderful reviews. I drive by FEZ nearly every day as I work just down the street.    Finally went with a buddy of mine and I got razzed more than Id like for picking out a sub-par place! That is factoring in the food and the service. Id probably give 2.5 3 stars for the food. Id give 1.5 stars for the service.  Went on a Sunday afternoon and it wasnt busy at all although the service would have suggested otherwise. Now dont get me wrong the waitress was very pleasant and personable but the time that went by before we got refills or that my dining companions DIET COKE was fixed to a regular coke took too long. Me not being a soda drink couldnt care less about diet vs. regular but I know I know you soda drinkers need to have it exactly as youre taste buds know.   The food: I already had a lunch so just got the kisra and hummus.  I must  say I was extremely impressed with the taste of the kisra....actually...I would come here for the kisra and hummus for lunch for sure. But I would get it to go. I wouldnt come back on a lazy Sunday afternoon b/c although Im being lazy I dont want the service lazy.  On to my friends lunch...he got the All-American Burger. To me this should have come on a sesame seed bun whats more American other than apple pieright?  Now I understand the Mediterranean flair that is FEZ but it just didnt seem right to call it All-American when its more like half-American....and his salt and pepper fries were not even warm-ish. And they tasted reheated. boo.  We both decided this would maybe have been a better time had if we were there in the evening. I think well give it one more try at night and see if we dont enjoy it a little more.  Maybe my hopes were built up b/c of all the other great reviews maybe we came at a bad time maybe he ordered the wrong item. Maybe Ill give FEZ another shot....but Im not in a hurry to do that right now.',2
'I fly - a lot - and I have to say that Sky Harbor is one of the better airports in the country. Its one of the highest volume airports yet its reasonably well organized. Ive heard that about 75% of the air traffic flows through Terminal 4 (thats where US Air and SouthWest fly out of).   If youve going to fly out of Phoenix very often my advice would be to start using US Air or SouthWest because a) its a hub for both of them and b) youll have much better flight choices and c) because of the competition the prices tend to be better. The other terminals by comparison are nearly deserted. Terminals 2 and 3 have very limited food choices. Terminal 4 has improved a lot in that regard.   There is a lot of parking available both on site and off site. The off site parking naturally is cheaper but you have to wait for the buses to bring you to the terminal. Compared to other airports of comparable size the on site parking is not that expensive. If its a business trip and you are getting reimbursed for the parking just park on site and save yourself the hassle. Honestly the best way to get in and out of Sky Harbor is not to drive at all but to use a transportation service. Im not talking about Stupper-Shuttle - dont get me started on them - but a real sedan service that will drop you at the curb and meet you at the security gate when you arrive back home.   If you can print your boarding pass at home rather than waiting in line at the airport. The airline clubs in my view are a waste of money. As another reviewer pointed out the wi-fi access is now free at Sky Harbor. I used to belong to the US Air club but let it lapse. The snacks are not that good they were charging for drinks. Unless you are regularly connecting through Phoenix how much time are you really going to spend in the airport? Now if youre connecting and have a long layover then it might be worthwhile but otherwise Id skip it.   I got a laptop stolen here once so a word about security. If you have a laptop computer put it through the x-ray machine last and dont take your eye off it for a moment. Particularly if its very busy.',4
'This photography team is amazing.  Not only are they good at what they do but they have fun doing it and youre guest will not mind having them around.  You and your family will be impressed with your photos and once you book with them once; I know you will again because I sure have two more times.  Thanks Kimberly and your team for your great service.',5
'The food was great. I had the Pot Roast it was very good. The server wasnt very good. Didnt come around much. It took a while to get a refill on my beverage. I really like the way this place looks. Only think I didnt like was the seating. The table I was at had pews or benches at first it looks cool but we sat on the side that had no back and you were basiclly touching backs with the people seated behind you. So as we finished dinner I got up an acidentally elbowed the person setting behind me in the ribs. That sucked having to end the meal with an appologie to the the person behind me.',3
'Wow! So good!  Weve been here three times now and have left super satisfied each time.  We love that its an independent restaurant and we are supporting a local business.  The service is great. The owner/his wife are always there. Joe (the owner) makes a point of coming around to each and every table to make sure his customers are satisfied. Last night we were talking to him and mentioned that we are getting married next month and he gave us each a free glass of champagne. How thoughtful! All the staff wants you to leave satisfied.  The food is by far the best Italian food in Phoenix possibly anywhere. It has tons of flavor tastes fresh and homemade. Get the minestrone soup to start- best anywhere. The pastas never disappoint.  Cute setting and great atmosphere! Go tonight!',5
'4 stars for food 2 stars for service  Im sorry but the counter service was lacking not that it was really his fault he just seemed to be overwhelmed. Maybe have two people taking orders so they dont seem so flustered an rushed? Or just train your staff a little bit better.  Here was the issue I didnt want dairy (wasnt in the mood to pop any lactaids). Most places nowadays are extremely accommodating due to the rising rate of allergies and non-dairy diets. When I went to order the kale salad I asked if there was dairy in the dressing the person taking my order looked at me like it was a very odd question and then proceeded to turn around ask the kitchen if it was. The kitchen staff ignored him and then he had to wait a while longer to ask again to find out adding more frustration to his job as he already seemed flustered due to expanding line. It turns out there was dairy in the dressing so I ordered a different dressing and then asked for the cheese to be removed too. The ordering process was very long and drawn out Im pretty sure a lot of people ask for omissions but this seemed to really perplex the order taker.  So after a long wait my salad arrives with cheese all over it. Ugh didnt I just spend several minutes discussing this with the person who took my order? The food runner proceeds to then show me the ticket saying that it didnt say that no cheese was requested. So either the order taker didnt put it on the order or it didnt go through. Either way I felt that the blame was then shifted on me to show that I didnt order no cheese. I explained to the food runner that I cant eat dairy so he took my salad back and several minutes later I received a new one that was right.   Once I got the salad it was pretty good but not worth the awkwardness of ordering it. I guess Im just so used to people being in the know about dietary issues since theyre so common these days that when I encountered someone that was so perplexed by it it just seemed weird.   Ill probably visit again because the food was good and I like healthy options hopefully this was fluke situation. Maybe Ill just pick something different where I dont have to customize anything next time.',3
'So maybe it is the off season or they think they do not have to care.  Did not find the same place as described by others here.  The staff in general was inattentive.  At the outdoor bar we asked twice to order drinks then asked for a menu.  40 minutes later I asked the bar tender if he could check with us and get a food order.  His reply was to go ask someone else I did not have to ask him and he walked away.  Then came around with a major attitude to get a food order.  In the mean time someone had thrown an olive or something at him  I think they were trying to get his attention to order a drink.  The next night we went to one of the restaraunts on the property and it seemed as if we were doing them a favor by coming by to eat.  Someone else noted that the place was almost empty and was wondering why they were told it would be 20-30 minutes.  She told them the tables are reserved for people who could make reservations.    Didnt bother to wait went out somewhere off property.  Most interesting also was to $2per person per day maid service charge!  Which I was told was part of the Group rate which is contracted.  I doubt the housekeeping people ever see this money.  While in the scope of things it is not alot yet this takes money from what are probably the lowest paid people at the place.  Many people may not tip on top of a maid service fee  I wonder if there will be a fee for cleaning you sheets and towels when you stay more than 2 or 3 days.  I was not very impressed with the overall experience.',2
'Yum! Yum! Yum!  Chicken and waffles combined are delicious sin! Soul food in general is usually delicious sin if you are counting calories but counting calories shouldnt even be thought of if entering this place; youll want to try everything! By everything I mean chicken waffles grits eggs home fries Kool-Aid and many many more goodies that are served here (and trust me you should try as much as you can).   Go get yourself some soul food already and leave this place smiling!',4

'Aww yea baby! By far my second favorite Costco (my first favorite one is in Honolulu and only because I can get Macadamia nut Hersheys Kisses!).  This has a gas station and...though my digestive tract hates me for it a kick ass cheese selection. The Costco back in the 408/415 doesnt hold a candle to this Costco in cheese selection.  I avoid any costco during their demo hours because frankly I have zero desire to be shoved aside by hungry little mothers with their monster kids. I detest trying to maneuver around people randomly stopping to chat to the demo person and having their cart blocking off an aisle. Have some consideration ok? Not all of us are there to eat!  The best perk to this Costco? Its less than 10 minutes from my house. WOO HOO!  Bummer they dont take other credit cards because I would love to get flight miles but its ok...I was persuaded to finally get an Amex and now I get back some rockin rewards!',4
'Great food nice place with good menu items. However I felt the drink I ordered was under poured and over priced based on other restaurants I order scotch on the rocks at. If they did not over charge for alcohol I would give four stars and go more often myself.',3
'This place has amazing food! I have been so satisfied with my breakfast visits! Get the Carne Adovada and eggs it is the best!',5
'We come here because of how close to the house it is but I think I am going to sacrifice convenience. I have had just a few too many negative experiences.  When I had my 4 new tires put on I left and found a block down the road they didnt take care of the tire pressure one tire was 20 pounds OVER and one was 20 pounds under.  20 POUNDS!! When I turned around and went back the customer service guy I delt with gave me attitude and excuses!! Yesterday we took the hubby car in and was informed they had been using the wrong oil in the past so they kindly gave him a %30 discount on this change well when he picked the car up and went to pay they wouldnt let him use his $15 off a purchase of $30 mailed coupon... They said because they discounted it already... well it was discounted because of their mistake and he still spent over $30 so he is still entitled to the coupon... so done with this place!',1
'The funghi pizza is incredible! The melon salad is wonderful and any pizza with roasted corn is a must-try.  They really have delicious fare and Ive had many positive experiences there.  Its the perfect spot for girls night or a date night.    The service is generally friendly prompt and unimposing (which is nice for girls nights and dates - plenty of opportunity to chat but you get what you need when you need it).    However Ive been here with large parties on several occasions and the service was sub par.  The waiters tend to be totally inattentive (Ive never seen that in a smaller party) they dont take reservations (you end up waiting for ages to get seated) and they wont split checks on a party of 6 or more.  All of this results in a really long experience with a lot of waiting a lot of manual check-splitting and some irritation.   CONCLUSION: Amazing food great for small parties take your large party anywhere else.',4
'3 strikes sorry Wy-Knot. Youre out.  On our first visit we waited for 30 minutes after placing our order for the food to come out. The place wasnt even crowded that morning. We decided to try again. On our second try I ordered the Stuffed French toast a signature dish. After 5 minutes the owner came out and apologized but they were out of the cinnamon bread to make it. No ingredients to make your famous dish? Amateur. I ordered something else. It was good. After some time we recently decided to try again. We arrived at 10 minutes till 9 and were seated and our order taken right away. Then the wait. And wait. Then an apology and some complimentary melon. Then finally our food arrived....at 9:45....55 minutes to get served....for breakfast...the quickest cooked meal there is. No owner visit. No explanation. Just slow... For the second time. Too many other choices in town. Sorry WyKnot.  Good food....too slow.',2
'Where do I begin?! I was able to stumble upon Chelsea after moving to Arizona. We all know how scary it is to move to a new place and leave an amazing hair stylist behind. Well Chelsea has replaced that hair void in my life! I cannot say enough great things about her and the work that she does. I truly enjoying my appointments and look forward to the time that I get to spend with her. I highly recommend Chelsea!!',5
'Wow...We all know Dennys is not known to be the best however this location is terrible. Its a real shame to because it wasnt always this bad. Its right near my house and a fairly new location. Every time I go there it gets a little worse but lets focus on my most recent visit there...  We get seated by a server who redefines the word incompetent. She takes forever to take our drink orders then walks by and asks if our food order has been taken. Shouldnt you know? Youre the waiter. Then she takes the order then returns with my drink a cup of coffee. The cup I got looked like the last person who drank out of it was a cheap call girl that applied way too much lip stick Dennys decided it was too complicated to wash the cup so served my drink in it. Dirty tables covered in debris was also a nice plus.  I was not offered anything when I advised staff about this. All I got was a forced Im sorry.........I will not be back.',1
'I stopped by Cafepino over the weekend for a family lunch (2 adults 2 kids) and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. Short version: incredibly overpriced bad food incredibly rude and inefficient service.  It started out well enough - I liked the atmosphere when we came in and we were seated quickly. We were given a lot of different menus - apparently both breakfast and lunch/dinner items were available and there were separate sheets with drinks and deserts. The menu was incredibly disorganized and confusing so it took us a while to decide on the order.  Eventually we decided on a couple of entrée items for the adults two kids meals a juice and a hot tea. This is where the trouble started. Our food took a very long time to arrive and while we were waiting two of the restaurant workers literally got into a shouting match a few tables away from us which ended about 5 minutes later with one of the two storming out of the restaurant. The other person followed shortly thereafter and their argument continued right outside in plain sight of all customers since they were standing by the window right outside the restaurant. This series of exchanges took some effort to explain to our young children while waiting for the food.  Since the restaurant was nearly empty my guess as to the long wait for food is that perhaps one or both of the people arguing and storming out of the restaurant were supposed to be cooking and serving orders. No one stopped by to offer us some bread or small appetizer or at least to apologize about the long delay. When the food did finally arrive it was incredibly bland and uninspired.  Our kids were getting very restless by now so I asked for the check shortly after the food arrived. I was assured that the check would be coming shortly. About 10 minutes later our kids had enough waiting so my wife took the kids and left the restaurant while I stayed behind to pay the bill. I made several more attempts to get the check and was finally told that one of the people who stormed out of the restaurant in that shouting match earlier was the cashier and they had called someone else to come in and take over and asked me to be patient.  While sitting there waiting to pay for this horror show I watched several hapless waiters mis-deliver meals and beverages bringing wrong food to the wrong people and having food turned away at the table numerous times.  I spent about 30 minutes in which no one ever stopped by my table to offer me a complimentary beverage or dessert as a way to apologize for the long delay. To add insult to injury when this backup cashier did arrive he simply dropped the check on the table without so much as a glance at me and ran off. And lo and behold they simply billed me for the full amount - get this $70 for two kids meals and two adult entrées a juice and a hot tea.  To recap - I sat through a shouting match which nearly came to blows (by restaurant employees) had to wait over half an hour for my check and did not get so much as an apology for all that. An absolute nightmare of a restaurant I will never go there again and wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy!',1
'Nothing is authentic here too much cheese beans and not much flavor. The chicken looks it has freezer burns  no flavor because they boil it before putting if on the grill',2
'Great beer and really good beer bread. You can sit at the very long bar or on the patio the two best places to be in the fall winter and spring. Outside you enjoy the great weather at the bar you are closest to the beer. The drawbacks are a relative lack of seasonal beers; a fruit-based beer always on tap and thus taking space from a more deserving beer that really tastes like beer and not some fruit soda enjoyed only by those who need training wheels on their beer (they probably drink Coors at home); and the freakin summer when its 110 outside. Four Peaks only has swamp coolers which are pretty ineffective when its hot and humid (July-September). Other than that a most excellent place for decent food very friendly servers and excellent beer (probably the best microbrews in the Phoenix area). Theres not a lot of parking either. Apparently when they built this warehouse as a creamery a 100 years ago or so parking wasnt given much thought. Stupid lack of foresight!',4
'I love Nordstrom let me start off my saying that.  But the last few times I have been there going back to the holiday season the service has left little to be desired.  I worked for about 3 years in retail at this very same mall and I was told when I first started to never judge a book by its cover in Scottsdale because the people you perceive as not having money probably have more money than god.  When I go into a department store I want to be treated nicely to ask if I need anything but I have received none of that when I come into this store.  This time I was in the shoe department wanting to buy a pair of shoes.  There were several people around trying on shoes and whatnot.  It seemed like there were a lot of workers there too so I was wondering around looking and never once did anyone ask if I was ok or needed anything.  I found what I wanted picked up the shoe and stood there for a bit waiting to see if anyone would come and help me.  Nothing!  So I walked to the middle of the floor and stood some more and tried to get someones attention.  I knew what I wanted knew the size so it would take any more than someone to run back to get the shoes.  I finally caught someones attention and asked if he could help me...he looked at me said Um I guess there is no one else around grabbed the shoe from me and said what size?  I told  him what size I needed and as he walked away he motioned to his other customer that he had to go get my shoe and kind of shrugged.  I sat there for 30 seconds got up and left.  I felt so annoyed and disrespected as a customer that no matter how much I wanted those shoes I would rather buy online if I have too.  Nordstrom this has been a trend for you.  I often shop at The Rail in your store and the people there are snobby and rude.  If you are selling high end stuff maybe you should start hiring high end people and not people who think they are above anyone because the basic customer is your repeat customer who will probably end up spending more money with you over the course of a year than the one time shopper!',2
'I like Los Olivos and regardless of their server issues I am understanding because they hire long-term staff and often family members. Some of the oddest server moments Ive had are here but I simply cannot give them a bad review for that because I keep coming back for the food. Their salsa is delicious margaritas are perfect and their cheese crisp was a part of my diet for a long time before I moved away from eating so much cheese...  One thing I will mention (especially if you are vegan) they use cottage cheese in their guac. I dont think thats right its clearly a cheap filler ingredient. Make sure to ask for it regular and theyll make it for you. That response was what got them four stars instead of anything less :)',4
'A great neighborhood gem offering something different.  The pita is excellent.  Warmed up with a little olive oil and they become the best snack this side of blueberries.  The gyros are also tasty and a nice and lighter deviation from the heavy Kronos variety that we see everywhere else.',4
'Within seconds of walking in I got a Damn! from a young gentleman standing next to his girlfriend. Gotta love when men disrespect their girlfriends right in front of them.    I went in the middle of the day in the middle of the week hoping to avoid lines.  I received help in 20-30 minutes at a window and had a woman who was expecting me to be a huge B to her and had her defenses up.  I managed to schmooze and get her to smile and hopefully brighten her day slightly.  Its a typical DMV not too amazing not feeling too safe while I was there but the reason why it went down two stars was that I believe there need to be more bilingual people that work there. I saw many people who needed assistance while I was there that could not be helped and it was depressing.  This area is just like Guadalupe and needs more Spanish speaking employees.  Thats all.',3
'if you grew up on 1970s style mexican food then this is your dream come true.  enchilada sauce the way its supposed to look and taste.  ditto on the green sauce.  tamales green or red are fresh.  they still call em cheese crisps.  if you love baja fresh or rubios then youre barkin up the wrong tree.',5
'Bourbon Steak house was a fantastic experience for us. I was able to take my bride and our daughter here at the end of our stay in Scottsdale. Food was great the service was outstanding. A very classy menu and staff.  The food was a wonderful experience in taste and texture..',4
'I went here for lunch today and it was a solid three star but has the potential to be a 4-5 star place. The place was pretty empty at lunch and my friend and I were seated right away. We ordered a bunch of things to share. Here is my complaint number one: We ordered the dan dan noodles potstickers eggplant and sesame pancakes....I asked the waitress if this was enough food for the two of us and she said no the apps were very small.....and we ordered some wonton soup. Well this was ridiculous we had enough food for 4 people I dont know what she was talking about! I guess it gave us an opportunity to try a lot of things. Anyway we received the dan dan noodles first. I thought they were a 3 star ok but nothing super special. They had a nice mild spiciness. I probably wouldnt get them again. Then we got the wonton soup. The soup was pretty par for the course as far as wonton soups go. Another 3 star dish. Next we got the potstickers and those were a definite 1-2 star item....they were like the frozen potstickers you get from trader joes. That is always such a disappointment. After that we got the yu xiang eggplant and THAT was a 5 star dish. The eggplant was very soft and had a good texture and it was extremely flavorful. I was happy we got it but at this point we were realizing the huge amount of food that we ordered. So finally we get the sesame pancakes and those are probably a 4 star they were good but not the best I have ever had. I am sure that this place has more gems like the eggplant and that I would need to come back to try some other things that would maybe bump up the rating for this place. Here is my second complaint: The service was awkward and slow. We sat around with the food sitting out for about 30 minutes before having to call someone over (who was just standing there looking at us) to ask for a box. Then again we waited for another 10 min or so to get our check. In the mean time the girls who work there were just standing there or walking by our table to another one of the 3 tables that were full in the restaurant. Also it kind of looks like people live in the back of this restaurant there were couches a tv people just hanging out behind a partition. Finally they left the doors to the place wide open letting in a massive amount of flies that bothered us throughout the meal....I dont love having flies all over my food and one actually died in my friends noodles and she had to pick it out.... yikes. I would give this place another shot but I have to say I wasnt thoroughly impressed today.',3
'This was my first time eating at an actual Thai restaurant and I loved it!  Went for lunch and our waitress was very helpful and recommended a great spicy tofu dish which was amazing!  Lunch combo came with soup which was sooooo good!  Our waitress said they (the servers) make it themselves during the week for lunch.  Its very light and fresh tasting...and vegetarian!  Also came with a spring roll rice and wontons.  Our bill came to less than $20 for 2 people!  I will definitely go back!',5
'I love bagels and thought I would try this place since I was driving by but when I pulled in they said they had closed - sign said bad economy..... bummer',1
'Fun place to hike up no climbing needed not recommend for serious hikers since I had an easy time with this.  It is easy to get to the path.  I will have the say this path can put some fear into your ankles and knees one slip on the way down on a loose rock or the patchy pavement and you can be hurt.  The view at the top is great it is even better if you like electronics.  If you dont well sorry.',3
'If you like your food spicy like me this is definitely a great place.  I loved my carne avado relleno!  We got a picher of house Margaritas for $21 bucks they tasted great and we got a great buzz.  I hate paying for Margaritas with no alochol in them not the case here!',5
'Because I live in the generic area known as the Chandler-Gilbert Divide and sometimes dont want to drive 30 minutes (or more) for a unique meal in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale I am always pleasantly surprised to find good eats nearby that save me the commute for food.  I loved Joes BBQ from the beginning because its pretty good casual reasonably priced and gives free food on your birthday.  Imagine my delight to find Joes Farm Grill (which also gives free food on your birthday) and provides the same casual atmosphere prices and good eats.    Im not going to say Im blown away by the food but the thing that keeps me going back is the philosophy behind it.  And the garlic fries.  And the portobello mushroom sandwich and the fried zucchini.  And probably the picnic table seating outdoors.  But not the scorpion tree.    Its just nice to find a place in that area that isnt an Applebees.',4
'Just a nice clean decent pasta. I love the brown butter and cheese pasta.   But you should not be expecting a lot when that side salad comes out. I think it was probably in a bowl in the freezer with Saran Wrap on it until that morning--and it was not thawed out fully. Thats not a deal-breaker for me though; this is a pasta place.   I wasnt in love with the meatballs but the sausage was pretty good. Id go back if I craved just a plate of pasta with no frills and didnt mind sitting in the middle of creepy decor to have it.',3
'I went here with some friends a couple weeks ago at about 830 pm. It was great. I asked the server what he would recommend to me and he said the Pad Thai with chicken. I ordered the Pad Thai and it was delicious. The server was very friendly and helpful.  We came back a few days ago at about 430 pm and I was not as impressed. I ordered the Pad Thai again but I was not happy with the server we had. She took forever to get our drinks and was not the friendliest. She also took my husbands soda while we were eating to refill it and took forever to bring it back. It was not even empty yet. I like the Pad Thai but there is nothing else very appetizing on the menu for me. I would come back for the Pad Thai.',3
'I went here for breakfast and was a little wary because I dont like eggs and most breakfast menus are full of nothing but eggs.  One thing on the breakfast menu really stuck out to me - banana bread french toast.  I may not like eggs but I LOVE banana bread.  Add some caramelized bananas on top and some vanilla sauce and caramel sauce AND nuts?  Now that just sounds like heaven.  And it was.  There were 2 full slices (I ate one for breakfast and took the other home for lunch).  I opted for the side of fresh fruit (I cant remember what the other choices were) and this was good also.  Their ice water has cucumber slices in it - different and refreshing!  I would definitely go back.',4
'This place is SOOOOO COOL! There is a ton of memorabilia from all sorts of sports and teams all over! It was crazy busy when we went on Saturday (mainly bc its spring training and they are big supporters of the Giants). We didnt stay to have drinks but we got to walk around (food looked great from what I saw on peoples tables as I tried to squeeze in to see the autographed baseballs).   We were really lucky this weekend when we got there because Willie Mays was there doing a charity autograph signing and we were also able to get right next to the Giants world series championship trophy on its traveling tour. The two women who were guarding it were really nice and let us take pics with it and look at it up close. We just couldnt touch it which is fine.   I want to come back here during non-Spring Training season because it was way too packed over the weekend and it looked like it would take 2hrs to get seated to eat.',4
'Apollo enjoys the simple things in life... fresh water kibble tummy rubs car rides with the window down frolicking at the dog park as well as walks and afternoon visits from Tim and the rest of the qualified pet sitters with Absolute Pet Care.  I feel lucky that we were referred to Tim (the owner of Absolute Pet Care) when we needed a pet sitter on very short notice over a holiday weekend. Initially I was worried that we wouldnt be able to find someone who could really care for 130 pound Great Dane (Apollo). Hes a handful. On top of that I expect the best when it comes to Apollos needs and spending my hard earned money. Once I met Tim during (practically the day before our trip) his professionalism eased my worries and he quickly became Apollos new best friend. I used to be a skeptic when it came to pet sitters and dog walkers l thought it wasnt worth it. Wrong! Its totally worth it the feeling of comfort is invaluable. I trust Absolute Pet Care with everything!    Even with a nervous owner such as myself Tim knew what to do. My main concern was that Apollo wouldnt adjust to a stranger coming inside the house but I was wrong again! In the free initial assessment Tim went above and beyond my expectations spending over an hour and a half getting to know us. Talk about detail-oriented! Beyond his comprehensive knowledge of pet care Tim is one cool and friendly guy. One thing was blatantly clear from day one - Tim genuinely loves animals. The compassion and flexibility shown while working with a high-maintenance dog like Apollo is why this is my top pet sitting and dog walking service in the east valley. The name of his company says it all Tim is absolutely the best!  With customized pet care instead of pre-determined prices and set services I never have to pay extra for things like walks or clean-up should any accidents occur. Since Apollo can be unruly on a leash Tim gave me some tips and used training techniques while walking Apollo without charging extra. No unexpected costs at all. Everything is clearly outlined from start to finish so I know the exact cost ans care tp expect. They leave detailed notes for owners to read upon return watch over the entire house and take care of all the little details like mail packages etc. Further each pet sitter is llicensed bonded and certified. Should any sort of problem occur I know someone can take care of my dog as well as my house.  Apollo enjoys spending time with Tim so much that I now use Absolute Pet Care for dog walking during the work week. That feeling of guilt when I have a late night at work or a hectic schedule is gone. Theres nothing more I could ask for from a pet sitting company. Yeah I could pay a little less and go with pet boarding a kennel the kid next door a neighbor or a friend but these pet sitters are so much more! I know this is a lengthy review but if your a doggie parent like me you need details. So if your going to need a pet sitter you absolutely should contact Absolute Pet Care especially if you live in the Old Town Scottsdale or Arcadia areas. Apollo highly recommends it!!',5
'I have came here 3 times since opening for 2 brunches and a dinner.  Everything Ive had here has been good: open-face breakfast sandwich short rib benedict pork chop.  I think the breakfast pricing is a little steep ($15+ with entree and coffee).  The dinner pricing is more reasonable but still over $25 for entree and 1 drink.  I guess I just do not feel like this restaurant is very special.  Im not sure if it is the cold setting as another review suggested or the impersonal staff.  Somehow I am not drawn to go back.  If you are in Chandler and need a clean restaurant with reliable food BLD is still a good choice.  Just dont expect to be wowd.',3
'Price and not as tasty as I like',3
'Heard so much about this place on my first visit to Phoenix this year but didnt get a chance to make it so when I found myself in town for the second time...I definitely had to make a meal of it. I enjoyed the pizza...I got the only one that comes without cheese. Amazing! Didnt think I would eat the whole pizza on my own and then I did. Great food. Good service. Valet parking is validated and you pay for it on your bill. Might be back to try other pizzas in a future trip.',4
'food was expensive service was a-ok. mediocore',3
'I was so excited to try this place. I have lived in the neighborhood for four years and also work at a restaurant in Arcadia. They did a great remodel considering what it was before. Super cute great atmosphere. The wine list was very good and so was the food! The arancinis were good. I ordered the steak which was cooked to perfection. I subbed out the risotto for cauliflower mash which was the best I have ever had. Overall I wasnt expecting to get a steak but Im glad I did. My friend got the Diavola pizza which was simple but good spicy in fact. And a lot of pizza. We finished with the bread pudding which was great. Nice crust tart fruit and caramel ice cream. And Matt really took care of us! Overall a great experience and a great addition to the neighborhood!',5
'I have been to FnB three times since it opened and each experience has been great!  Food is fanatstic - propers to Charlene and Pavle! This is a restaurant not to be missed!

Also the late night (10 p.m.) daily dinner special will not disappoint!',5

'Just discovered this absolutely fantastic Thai restaurant!!  We ordered edamame crab rangoons Panang curry chicken and pineapple fried rice...    The crab rangoons were some of the best I have tasted (and Ive tasted many!!) ...  it is one of my favorite appetizers to order and these tasted freshly made hot from the fryer!  The Panang curry chicken was phenomenal .. it has a coconut curry sauce over large pieces of white chicken .. had such a delicious flavor!  I chose medium spiceness (and I am a wimp when it comes to spicy) and it had just the right amount of spicy .. enjoy to clear the sinuses but not leave the mouth burning too much!!  The pineapple fried rice was tasty too ... it has shrimp and chicken with pieces of pineapple mixed in to the rice .. was very good!!  Definitely will be visiting this place again!!',5
'I got a 3.99 meal coupon at work so decided to try Souper Salad.  Basic salad bar with some fruit and cold pasta salads 4 soups 1 pizza choice 2 hot pastas ground beef tacos 3 dessert breads and a soft serve machine.  Everything was pretty simple and bland tasting.  Maybe Im just too spoiled by Sweet Tomatoes.  But who am I to complain! I only paid 3.99.  (I think this is a great place if you have several little ones to feed though. Its cheap with a coupon and they will like the kid friendly healthy food.)',2

'Thanks to the incorrect map I was looking all over for this store at Rural and Elliot.  I finally called them and found out they were way out at Elliot and Priest.  The store itself was fine chock full of Halloween costumes since it was late October.  Tons of costume accessories too.  But they didnt have much of what I was looking for.  The luck of the draw I know.    I did buy a couple of things so it wasnt a wasted trip.  The best thing was a bag of pretty mauve yarns for $2.99.  There were two complete skiens and one barely used.  When I opened the bag up later I found price tags on them for $12.99 each!  They were top quality from a yarn store not cheapies from Michaels or Joanns.  So that was a coup.',3

'Went here last night for a friends birthday dinner. We got a table in the side room (you can rent the entire room for $250 I think they said). The staff was very nice but I agree it was a bit slow but we still enjoyed ourselves. Beer was tasty of course and I got the Green Chili Pork - delish! if you like a spicy dish because it was :)  We will try this place again for sure... just dont be in any kind of hurry. Oh also if you are with a group they dont seem to like splitting checks so having cash is best.',4
'I ate here recently with my wife mother in law and 3 month old son.  We ate inside which was pleasant.  Outside looked more enchanting but Im not used to the Phx heat....even in April.  :-)  Anyway the food was above average but a little underwhelming considering the price.  The service (again for the price) was bush league.  Our server although he tried was unorthodox unpolished and generally a little nervous.  I expected more from a place like this.    Hope this helps you make your decision.  I think we got stuck with a lame waiter.',3

'Five of us visited Sekai Sushi for dinner. None of us ordered sushi. It took a looong time for our orders to arrive.  My dish was the tempura variety: shrimp and vegetables tempura with miso soup salad and rice.  The miso soup was average the salad had a spicy hot dressing on a cumber slice with iceberg lettuce that was so-so. The tempura batter was thick and crunchy instead of light and crisp plus it was oily.  My wife was surprised to find the ramen noodles to be spicy. No one was complementary about their meal.',2

Having recently purchased a bank-owned home I have spent the last two months dutifully replacing every single stinking item the idiot prior owners stole. Some things are more fun to replace than others. New light fixtures? Okay fun. Faucets? Sure cool. But trim rings for recessed lights? Not so much. Especially when I found out they ran for $12 each... um WHAT???  Almost eight hundred bucks on stupid metal rings just so my house will look less ghetto? And so commenced my search for reasonably priced trim rings. After finding them online somewhere for just over five bucks a pop I ended up at Construction Lots one desperate afternoon. Lo and behold they had boxes and boxes of the stupid little bastards... $8 each. Long story short the attentive manager heard my plight and sold me all 65 kits for just over $5 each. Hell yes! Id rather give my business to a local shop and save on shipping anyway. Construction Lots has made it to the top tier of my rotation for home improvement items indeed. Many thanks to the awesome staff there and Im sure I will see you all soon as I continue to knock the to-do items off my neverending list. One minor caveat which is understandable given the close-out nature of their items: no returns. Make sure that faucet you buy actually fits. Not that I would buy a faucet without doing measurements or anything. Just sayin.',5
'Went to Postinos with our Light Rail Pub Crawl group and was highly impressed with the service we received from the staff at postinos. Its rare when a restaurant is able to provide seamless service for this large of a group but the staff works well as a team and it shows! They got us seated and fed right away. All the food was delicious and great for sharing! They had a $7.50 pitcher of hoegaarden special that was too good to pass up. I highly reccommend this location as good place for groups.',5
'Yuck.  I only went here because my manager was in town with me and says that he always goes here when hes in Scottsdale.  Im honestly not sure why.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had enchiladas which were dry and gross and no one else seemed to like their meals - except my manager who had tacos.  Maybe that is the thing to get?  I did really enjoy my margaritas (I may or may not have had almost a whole pitcher all by myself) but that was about it.',2
'= = = = = = CLOSED = = = = = =  After having enjoyed this nice 3-Star place which we regulars called Eastern Buffet & Tacky Swapmeet for over two years I was sad to come up here today & find them gone.     :-(  For a similar place nearby I went to New China Buffet today & enjoyed it.  Theyre at 2939 N 24th St.',3
'The Wild Ahi Sliders from True Food Kitchen come with wasabi radishes cucumber and a sesame brioche. Dont be mislead the wasabi is merely a nice little portion which gives you a perfect essence no epic nasal burns here. I ordered mine with the sweet potato hash which was absolutely amazing and the Green Arnie (Matcha Green Tea & Honey Lemonade) for my drink which was very refreshing and a perfect match. If you get the opportunity to stop in look for Nate hes the cool guy at the bar. Hell get you squared away. True Food Kitchen is a cool place great atmosphere with awesome people. Highly recommended!',5
'I went here for the first time yesterday during happy hour! It was definitely cheap and so many rolls omg. The place was really busy and I like how theres a choice to sit outside or inside. The feeling of this place was good. As for servers maybe they should hire more. The waitress came to the table about 4 times and I ran out of water and it didnt get refilled. Anyway it was a pretty chill first time here. Aside from the amount of rolls they tasted good if only they had some type of eel rolls on the happy hour menu... Overall I like this place.',4
'Berry berry nice!!!',5
'This place is awesome!! Great food great service and overall great ambiance. The menu is great and has something for almost anyone and the beer selection is huge!! I love places with big bold beer lists!! The only reason I didnt give five stars is because it gets sooooo loud inside when the place is full. Music is loud people are loud and the acoustics are not designed to allow for casual conversations. But like I said overall this place rocks!!',4
'Oh AZ Mills....where to start.  Parking: There is plenty of it. I find that the worst places to park are on either side of the movie theater or in front of Burlingtons.  Food: A pretty decent food court as far as selection goes and some good mid mall snaking as well. Personally I gravitate towards Nathans or Americas Taco Shop (so glad they added this place).  Shopping: I remember when this mall opened and whe it was mostly kitchy kind of unheard of stores and outlets. Now it seems to be more upscale-ish stores (not exactly outlets since most have new merchandise too). There are still the factory/outlet stores as well (Group USA JC Penneys outlet Burlingtons Sears appliance outlet etc). There are a few maps throughout the mall for your finding conveinence but I recommend looking at the map online beforehand if you know of a specific store you want to visit. It kinda helps w/ parking.  Be warned this place is a MAD HOUSE on weekends. Filled w/ lots of teenagers and large families w/ multiple strollers. It makes it very hard to get around. I recommend going during the week. 90% of the sales are the same and its much less frustrating.  Happy shopping!',3
'I went here about a year ago with a friend and enjoyed it. Nice staff good food and was pleased. I have a group of friends from work that we rotate selecting a restaurant to out eat at. I decided on The Melting Point as my choice and phoned the restaurant to place the reservation. The guy taking the reservations could hardly be heard or understood--there was no accent just a rushed feeling to get off the phone.  I explained there would be a party of 8 people dining for dinner. I was told I needed to provide a credit card to hold the reservation and if we were late or no-shows a $10 per person charge would be applied. WHAT!?!  Needless to say I contacted my friends and picked another restaurant that doesnt pull these kinds of tricks. Sorry Melting Pot but thats a bit rude and a good way to drive off repeat customers.',1
'Wife and I met local friends here for dinner. The place looked a little sketchy sitting in a strip mall parking lot like a converted Dairy Queen. Our friends beat us there had a nice bottle of Italian red open and a table on the patio. I was a little apprehensive until I realized our friends are regulars they raved on the food and we went to the counter to order.  The cases were loaded with Italian deli meats cheeses olives anchovies aged t-bones a massive veal chop...things were looking up. We looked over the blackboard menu and the regular dishes and made some selections. Not your run of the mill pseudo-Italian joint.  The rigatoni with meat sauce was very good rich spicy and tubes were perfectly al dente. The grilled calamari was exceptional not overcooked and rubbery as one comes to expect. The house made mozzarella salad with tomatoes and basil was reportedly excellent though my wife offered none to me bogarting it entirely. Everything delivered a sense of freshness and had a home made quality.  Service was friendly familiar like a neighborhood place that you would return to again and again. The payment scheme was strange as you go back to the order counter and pay as you are ready to leave. But that was no problem. And prices were very reasonable. I would come back to Scottsdale just to eat here again.',5
'Slow service and overpriced ice cream. I would come for the retro feel if they were more productive.   Skip it and go to Churn.',2
'Only went to this place for the Sangria (Passion Fruit of course) but we actually got chatted up by the owner. Found that Phoenix magazine put them up on the map in their latest issue no payment necessary. Went during the Festival of lights parade and couldnt find our way out after dinner... what a mess this cen pho traffic. I had their burrito sorta enchilada style with the creamy sauce. (sauce makes everything better) just wasnt sure it was worth the extra 4 bucks for sauce. The Salsa was bad ass like getting kicked in the mouth... Loved it. Abso****ingloutley Love this place.',5
'I bought a Groupon.com deal for this restaurant... I am so happy I did!  They had amazing food and it was super cheap! Get the green sauce your life will be changed forever! :) Staff was very friendly and the food came out quick!  Churros are good here (most places churros are soggy or overcooked) they had the perfect crispyness to them!',5
'The grand babies and I had a great experience at Big Surf this Thursday 7/18/13. Kudos to Erica in customer service.  For reason I couldnt purchase the tickets online so I called the Park Erica answered I explained the online site wasnt taking my card and I tried several times and no results.  I asked if they would grant an online price if I purchased tickets at the park.  Erica said she would have to ask her manager and call back. Well Erica called back and I gave me the online price.  Thank you Erica for taking the time to call me back and making the experience amazing.. Erica you will go far in life with an attitude like that...',5
'Worst Brat I have ever had(dry overcooked bland).  Everyones food was cold and we waited an hour for our food and it was not even busy!  The group sharing the table with us also said that it was the worst service and food that they have had in a long time.  Too bad.  I was hoping for a great place.',1
'within seconds of posting my review the owner messaged me and offered to buy me tacos!! this just made me love hulas even more.  dana i will be back- a lot we had such a great time.  you had me at hula.',5
'Great steak sandwiches!   Consistently good food and large portions!  Been going here for YEARS!  Only problem is they serve Pepsi products :(',4
'Based on the reviews from some of the people I would have to disagree. The gelato is not that great. Im a little perplexed by the near unanimous 5 stars. I seriously dont think these people in Phoenix havent ventured past AZ state border. Ive had gelato here and I thought I was eating Coldstone.',2
'The worst customer service of all time! Worse then Direct TV worse then SRP worse then Chase. Incompetent!!! Incompetent!!! Incompetent!!! -NO CLUE how to do their jobs. I hate this company! ZERO STARS!',1
'Where to start. I am still upset.  My husband and I usually avoid chains but since we had the twins we are getting more intimate with some chains.  We were trying to find a new one since the other two we go to have been beaten to death.  With two year old twins choices are a little scary.  I went along and agreed to go to Arriba.  Last time we were there was 4 years ago and it was your typical mediocre fare which is fine for a quick lunch during work week. First we order for the kids the chicken fingers and what I thought would be strawberry smoothies.  What a surprise when I had a sip and realized it was a virgin strawberry daiquiri. I was giving my twins pink sugar water.  Not the end of the world.  I ordered some milk.  Then my husband and I were going to share the chicken fajita quesadilla.  The waiter Omar seemed fairly nice.  He came by a second time to verify if I wanted beef quesadilla and I told him No I want chicken no beef please.  Then he pushed for us to add the guacamole and sour cream which I said fine to bring it with it and I repeated chicken quesadilla. When it came the quesadilla looked like a sad greased soaked blanket.  My biggest surprise came when I took a bite and guess what I found? Beef.  I had to spit it out and call Omar I explained to him this was a beef quesadilla he gave me this puzzled face and asked: You didnt want beef? I thought it was a joke by that time the twins were getting rowdy and they had not touch the rock hard fried to death chicken fingers.  So I told him to take off the quesadilla and we would pay for everything else we didnt eat but had ordered.  Afterwards we called from the car and talked to the manager. He wanted to do something for us but I told my husband I didnt want to go back so we didnt accept anything.  I guess CPK with the kids again.',1
'Emerson Fry Bread food truck was at Chase Stadium for Hispanic Heritage Day.   That day my grubby little fingers had the delight of sampling something called Kai Kai. This would = cinnamon sugar + honey on fry bread. Yes I was carefully watching carbs back then.  And I watched them go down my gullet.  STAT.  My date and I ripped that bread apart faster than you can imagine. Heathens! More like savages. (Sorry Mom! But I remembered to say Please and thank you. I think.)  It may sound like an odd combination of flavors but its quite tasty. Also deep fried bread (or at least this deep fried bread) can be a light and fluffly thing of wonder.   GOOD STUFF!',4
'I checked in and got a free edamame..  That was pretty cool.  The rolls are pretty big and it was fresh. Some things here are not my taste like the music.. or that sake was barely on the menu.  Id happily go back though.',3
'There are at least four Starbucks in this airport - this is the one in T4 just inside Security Checkpoint C by gates C1-C10.  A surprisingly nice airport Starbucks. When I was there it was quiet without a line. There is a seating area with four tables and three sets of four armchairs. You could actually sit here and believe that you were at any Starbucks not inside an airport.  The place was well staffed (I believe there were three employees) and my drinks came quickly. They had bananas when I was there which was nice plus a limited assortment of baked goods (it was later in the day).',3
'LOVE Bison Witches. The bread bowls are where its at. My only complaint is that I get bored with their menu. I wish they would do a special from time to time.',4
'Service was impeccable. Food came out fast. Commentary valet. The menu was unusual but delicious. Prices were moderate and reasonable. Went on a week night made a reservation but there was plenty of room for us.  It is part of The Yard which give you a great place to have a cocktail afterward. I would highly recommend you check this place out.',5
'Talk about great customer service in unforeseen circumstances. I was at Stand Up Live last thursday to see Amy Schumer headline. When the show did not kick off on time began to think something was up. Not long after the owner came out and announced Amy was sick and on her way to the hospital. He said to make it up to us not only would the show continue that night but we would be refunded for our tickets given tickets to see Jeff Ross the following weekend and when Amy reschedules free tickets to that show. Just the refund and Ross tickets would have been plenty.  But them making it up to us didnt end there. After the feature comedienne who opens for Amy and would have been last up they announced they had somebody who wanted to send us home happy and brought out Kevin Farley (Chriss brother) to do a set. When he was done they said they had 1 more surprise and out walked David Spade (who I had known was in attendance from seeing a table reserved for him when I went to the bathroom pre-show).  Farley and Spade were great and wanted to make sure everybody went home happy  and we did.   Only reason this places looses a star is because the seating is very cramped with 4 people to a table designed for 2. However the service was nice in that they automatically asked about split checks so you dont have to worry about trying to split a check with strangers like some other places *Cough*Tempe Improv*cough*. There were times when we wanted out servers attention and couldnt get it due to the odd seating and him not checking back for awhile at a time.  Really my experience was a 4.5 star and they handled a tough situation in excellent fashion. Highly recommend checking out a show here. Ticket prices arent bad and drinks were decent.',4
'Ive been coming to Pony Express ever since the store was known as Magic Touch Cleaners and theyve always done a great job with my laundry and dry cleaning.   The girls up front are always helpful and friendly when I come into the store and they are quick to oblige in getting me my clothes cleaned and ready with a fast turnaround time.  Ive found that the prices are good - competitive. If youre looking for a $2.00 cleaner this isnt it you pay for the quality of service and cleaning that you get at Pony Express.',5
'My  friend and I brought our kids here and we enjoyed the park tremendously. We arrived closer to closing time and pretty much had the place to ourselves.  The displays are incredibly creative and some of the animals were up so it added to the fun. We spoke with the giraffe and enjoyed watching the water show. Will come back again and again.',4
'Expected an amazing experience... Was a bit let down. Sushi was ok - but not creative at all. Was trying not to compare but the sushi at Virago in Nashville is leaps and bounds better (try the Ecuador roll!). Server was pushy and annoying. Was glad to get out of there and get to the Living Room at our hotel - the W Scottsdale where Sushi Roku resides.    Tip: if you stay at the W you get a card for a free appetizer tasting at sushi roku. This ended up being just an amuse from the chef that they took off the bill because of the card we received - and after lots of questions about what we liked and didnt like - 2 meatballs came out as the amuse. That is NOT an appetizer tasting experience - it was an amuse - which in nashville means super cool thing a chef makes that is free and makes you happy. NOT the same at Sushi Roku. Left me disappointed.',2
'Great burgers and beer',4
'I am in love with Durants! I went for dinner last night expecting a quiet meal in a near empty place (on a Monday) and got just the opposite. It was like Saturday night at Durants. All of the tables were filled and people were standing around waiting to fill the ones most recently vacated. We ordered a bottle of wine and perused the menu. I have to say that I love the fact that your entree comes with sides included instead of having to order everything a la carte that is annoying. I decided on the  scallops and boy was I happy! There were seven scallops and they were big ones! They were cooked perfectly- so tender and moist and amazing! I didnt want the meal to end. Someone ordered the halibut which would have been my second choice and it was a great piece of fish! The steaks looked good as well but I only had eyes for fish on this visit. And potatoes. I had a baked but tasted the roasted garlic mashed and would definitely go with the mashed next time. They were incredible!  Everything about Durants was amazing: the service ambiance food the feeling. Its definitely a one of a kind establishment that we are lucky to have in Phoenix.',5
'I lived in L.A. for 26 years and am addicted to pho.  So much so that I know the quality of the pho is 60% broth.  This place understands the basics.  The broth is always great. The one reason I didnt score it a 5 is because the broth has tasted differently every time I visit.  It is always good just never consisitent.  I wish they could keep the quality at the peak level Ive tasted a couple times before.  Some pho enthusiasts will applaud this fact because it proves how authentically home-made this soup is and theres an argument for that.  A good broth takes 24 hours to prepare.  And might I add their meat is of great quality representing the other 40% of the pie.  This is the only pho restaurant Ill frequent in the valley.',4
'Ill preface this review by saying that I was there on a Saturday night and the place was pretty packed and loud. I have no idea what this place is like during the day but if youre like me and dont enjoy strangers bumping into you every 30 seconds dont go on a Saturday night.  This brings me to the important part of my review which is how I almost had to throw down with some v-neck clad Jersey Shore hopeful who felt it necessary to almost knock my girlfriend and I down as he walked past. I guess he didnt like the fact that I pushed back to avoid falling into the table my friends were sitting at because he got into a staring contest with me trying to size me up. Personally I dont care who you are; there is no excuse for acting like that especially to a lady and then trying to get in my face about it because I didnt allow you to manhandle me. I told him if he tried that again we could finish the conversation outside. I guess he knew better than to try anything when security guards are near because he left.   That being said theres a high risk of these incidents happening in places like these where there is absolutely no room to walk by people are drunk and ignorant and egos are running high. It takes away from an otherwise enjoyable experience. The music was good the beer was cold and my friends and I had a great time. However due to that incident I had I dont see myself going back. Its a shame because it is otherwise a pretty cool place.',2
'I just discovered this place a couple weeks ago and have gone 4 or 5 times since. I really like the food they use some fresh ingredients.  There are multiple locations however. I first went to the one on University and had a great experience. The one on Southern however for some reason really seems to short you on ingredients. Twice now I ordered two sandwiches and paid extra to add the hemp cream cheese to them. Both times now they have barely put any on there but still charged me $1.00+ for the addition. They were both delivery orders or perhaps I could have said something when I got them.   The part that really is frustrating yesterday when I ordered the sandwiches I said to the guy that last time it didnt look like there was much if any cream cheese on the sandwiches and asked if he could make sure it gets added.  The shop on University added a generous amount both times I have gone.  Otherwise I have no complaints. I will still give the other place on Southern a chance to redeem themselves... mainly because they deliver.',3
'THe food here was not good. We ordered several dishes including the dumplings seafood and noodles. I didnt like any of it and would definitely not go back',2
'You go to someone like Dave because he specializes in British & Related higher caliber vehicles. Why...? You dont have to worry about them cross threading oil plugs or other BS that happens on the cheap-o places. Ive come to Dave a few times on strategic repairs on my Land Rover (repairs that only fix what is needed) so the car keeps rolling. Dave and his crew understand this and dont try BS up-selling. If one wants to be a low-budget player and drive a British car then one is dreaming. Try a Toyota beep-beep.  -- bottom line -- Dave and his team get the job done and at a fair-market price for the caliber of car. Try going to the dealer and you will pay much more.    Whatever to the whining about a $70. oil change. Head back to Jiffy Lube sounds like you already going there Korina or get a corolla.    ** update 6/27/11 Dave and his team got my car in and out in under an hour. I passed emission after some minor adjustments. DAVE AND HIS TEAM DELIVER!!',5
'I have had the pleasure working with Brandon and his team on multiple occasions (new purchase re-fis) over the past few years and I simply cannot say enough good things about him and his entire team.  From first phone call to closing we were proactively informed all the way through. No surprises. This is as easy and low stress as it gets.',5
'One of our favorite restaurants Latitude Eight gets it right.  The atmosphere is inviting clean and fun.  The waitstaff treats you as if you are a friend.  The food is spot on.  We have been here many times and always have had a great dining experience.',5
'If you fear flavor...this is the fare for you! The nice thing is you dont even have to request no flavor....they omit it automatically.   I had some high hopes reading the menu as there are were some very creative and outlandish combinations of ingredients in their entrees.   Even the ranch dressing was flavorless and had I had some hidden valley nearby I would have substituted it out.',2
'Chill vibe good food! Yup this is in my hood and yup its a great repeat go to local place.',4
'Dont waste your money on a jimmy johns sandwich. There is nothing special about these sandwiches. This is the worst sandwich shop I have been to. You will get a better sandwich by making one at home.',1
'After reading Yelp reviews I decided to try this place. Good Chinese is hard to find anywhere. Its on the way home and I was craving Chicken Fried Rice with a side of extra green onion. Duck juice too please but they dont do that here.  Heres a break down of my stars:  1 Star:  Quick Service. While at the counter I had Yelp up on my phone and I think the lady saw it because I placed my order she gave the order to the kitchen and started speaking in Chinese. It sounded like hurry up with order this new customer and he on Yelp!  My order came out ahead of 2 orders previously placed by customers ahead of me. Hmm. Ok impressive.  2 Star:  Tons of Rice. The small box was stuffed with rice and generous amount of chicken. I had it for dinner and brunch the next day.  3 Star:  Friendly face with a smile for service and rightly priced. The side of onion was only 50cents extra with my total being about $5. The place was also clean on the inside.',3
'Went at 2pm so no problem at all with service or seating.  Our waitress Jen was exactly what you want when visiting a new place very knowledable about the dishes and extremely friendly.  Plaintain chips were delicious and my friends seemed to like the cerviche.  My steak tacos were delicious.  The only problem was I could have eaten about 9 of those extremely  little devils which would have come to $36. Prices are high here but the place is impeccably appointed very comfortable and food seems great.',4
'Another big thanks to Yelp & Groupon which both lead us to Roka Akor for an early dinner last week.   First off the service was impeccable. The entire menu was explained perfectly & there was never a minute our waters were even close to being empty.   Secondly the food. The grilled pork belly is a fabulous starter. The dynamite scallop roll is hands-down the best sushi roll Ive ever had in my life.  The yuzu miso marinated black cod was a fantastic piece of fish with great flavor. Essentially we ordered everything marked with the Roka Akor signature and didnt have one bite that wasnt delicious.  Pretty pricey but totally worth it.',5
'This is  the best place to get a cheese steak sandwich in the Phoenix area.  They use to deliver i wish the would now but go there and eat. They are the best.',5
'Best gyro I have ever had. Tons of meat! Ask for extra tzatziki (sp?) sauce. Side Salad is fresh too.',5
'Its quaint and drinks are reasonable. The bartenders are still nice and free pour a great cocktail.  The jukebox plays good music.  It reminds me of a beloved bar in Alaska on a winter night because it is warm & dark inside and the walls are wood paneled.  And the bartender offers to call you a cab after 2 drinks when I cashed out.',4
'I have never been able to complain about anything Ive ordered from here. Sometimes the dudes confused fries with rice but its not like I especially NEED french fries. Prices are reasonable. They have a drive through.  One day I bought an Adobada burrito from Rivas and I swear to God it was THE BEST burrito I have ever had in my life. The pork was perfectly seasoned / perfect temperature and the tortilla was just perfect. Ugh. So good. Carne Asada is always great at Rivas. If youre into Carne Asada fries get them here.  The chile relleno isnt the best Ive ever had but definitely the best in comparison to small taco shops like Los Favoritos or Filibertos.',5
'Okay after barfing all over my shirt following the Yelp event (I drank WAY to much!) I decided that mama needed a new shirt. Im always impressed how service is just all over the place here. Sometimes it friendly and attentive while other times its some punk with his pants below his ass. Why do punk kids where their pants like that? Is it for easy access to their back door? Yuck!  Today good service and great selection! Moma didnt find a shirt tho I can never leave here without getting a few new pairs of CK undies off the clearance table. Yes I shop clearance and am proud of it!!',4
'Always perfect!!!',5
'Awesome staff. Sat at the counter and watched tons of great looking food go by. I went for the Lil ol Country Girl which is an egg bacon sausage and biscuit and gravy. The kitchen claims proudly I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage. And they delivered the best gravy Ive ever passed by my lips. We will definitely be back.',5
'Spicy mango margarita on happy hour! Its the best thing theyve got.   I always get the chicken burrito with a wheat tortilla and black beans with the rice on the side. They give you a generous portion and Im able to add as much or as little as I want to my burrito depending on how hungry I am.   Their happy hour is great and they have an awesome range of margaritas and beers.   I also have to say that they are SUPER willing to help you plan an event. Theyve offered to set aside the patio for a large party and they really seem to take the time to help you without being difficult. I never felt like I was an inconvenience to make requests of them. They have wonderful customer service.   Get there early on Friday/Saturdays because it WILL fill up. The food is great for the price and quality.   Also try the taco sauce on the salsa bar. Its spicy but SO GOOD.',4
'Wow I really am glad Groupon guided me to this place.  I was a little worried after reading some reviews but pleasently surprised that the place didnt stink as one stated and that even though food was pricey it wasnt without merit.   For starters the bruschetta was great I am a huge fan of garlic and there was a lot of it.  After that came the dinner salad which had a creamy homemade Italian dressing on it which was just awesome they should bottle that stuff up and sell it at the front.  Finally my main course was Veal Lasagna yes thats right VEAL mmmmm.  It was full of flavor and the portion was just right.    After all this I still had to try a dessert so I went with raspberry sorbet dipped in dark chocolate.  It was a nice refreshing way to end the meal.    This place would be a five star if it wasnt for the a/c pumping the whole time when it wasnt needed.  Other than that I loved it and will totally go back.  It was one of the better Italian places I have been to in the valley for food.',4
'Never been to Cuba but I really respect its food.  The food is filled with flavors really brining the Cuban culture to through its food.  This is a traditional ma and pa restaurant that can open your eyes to new flavors.',3
'Have been a subscriber for a year. Terrific car wash. I get the $7 wash which comes with some kind of wax. Cool thing is after a year of going every week my black car has a deep amazing glossy shine - looks fantastic!',5
'They took care of my project with short notice their website didnt help at all so I went in to the copy center.  They got it done in 12 hours and even on a Sunday.  Good prices with the sale they were having so Im pleasantly surprised!',3
'Visited Havana Café Last week with a Groupon deal. Ive been wanting to come to this place for years but just kept putting it off. I found the food to taste very authentic. Ive heard so many people say bad things about this place but I cant agree. I used to have some Cuban friends who cooked for me all the time. I didnt recognize the names of the plates but when reading the descriptions I found many of them to sound just like things Ive eaten before that was cooked by my Cuban friend  If I closed my eyes I honestly would have thought it was homemade by my old friend. The portions were very generous and the service was pretty good. I didnt care for the atmosphere at this location so Im anxious to try the other location.  Since my friends arent around anymore Im excited that I found a place where I can get authentic tasting Cuban food when I have the craving...  Ill be back.',4
'A good friend of mine wanted to take me for a new experience before we were to attend a party in Scottsdale. We were asked to leave because we were not wearing proper attire.  I questioned the manager what was the dress code and he could not answer me nor was it posted on the front door but this site says casual so I guess costumes dont count as casual but clearly there was no reason to seat us take our drink order and then ask us to leave.  I think Bandera has poor customer service since they didnt seem to try and find accommodations!',1
'Oh Federal Pizza...How I love thee!    I just want to sit and try every single one of their wine coolers. My current favorite is the watermelon mint.  Not only are the wine coolers delicious but so is the food. One of my favorite things to eat are meatballs (I know weird right?!) and they are so darn good here. Dont forget to order the Bambolini even if you are full from the pizza...trust me!! :)  I have been here several times and have never once been disappointed.  I also have to mention the service because it is better than amazing! Everyone is helpful and friendly.',5
'What a lovely Sky Harbor surprise!!  Had 3 hour delay for a flight and stumbled on this.  With $18 in delay vouchers to defray the $ 70 dinner/drinks I ate well.  A few very delicious margaritas led into some of the most amazing devised eggs I have ever had like ever.  The prime rib sandwich was too pinkish/rare for me but the fries were sublime.  Next time Roasted chicken or burger.  Fairly good service.  Wonderful addition to the airport if I do say....  Ill be back.',4
'Really would love to do a 3.5 star thing here but you know....  After a little shopping my friend and I decided to check out Tanzy.  Neither one of us had been there before.  We climbed the escalator and were immediately wowed by the ambiance.  Gorgeous comfy sofas up front with small fires for lighting.  We approached the hostess and were seated in the dining room.  Im pregnant and ready to throw down on appetizers dinner AND dessert.  The hostess supplied an appetizer and drink menu and told us our waiter would bring us a dinner menu.  5 minutes later someone came by with bread and water.  Thats a good start.  10 minutes go by still no waiter.  And Im a starving pregnant woman.  Im about to gnaw off my arm.  I tell my friend - Lets go.  I need to eat.  We walk out the door and we get the friendly Have a great night.  Did the hostess not realize she just sat us 15 minutes ago?  I spin on my heel and in full hormonal pregnant mode I said quite curtly Weve been here for 15 minutes and nobody even came by to take a drink order.  Fortunately Mark Im assuming the manager asked us if he himself could take care of us.  I was fuming and debating.  Were here might as well have an appetizer and a mocktail.  OK.  We decided to be quick and stay for a drink and app and move along and opted for the comfy sofas up front.  A very nice waitress (and I forget her name - prego brain) came by with her smile and apologized for the mishap in the dining room.  Not her fault but appreciated it.  She took our order and she got me a fabulous cosmo mocktail and it was actually put in a martini glass.  Thank you for making a pregnant woman feel normal for a minute!  (Usually you get the ol soda glass - whats the point in that?)  My friend got a martini as well.  We ordered the full mozzarrella platter prepared table side!  WOW.  Pick your salt healthy amount of proscuitto figs olive tapenade pesto and fire roasted tomatoes.  Our waitress came by asking us if we wanted dinner.  We declined.  It was a lot of food on the app platter for 2.5 ladies.  Mark came by several times to check on us as well.  He asked if we would like dessert - we declined.  He said Please on me.Its pretty  Pretty?  Well okay...  Why not?  Beautiful presentation of rosemary olive oil bread balls with vanilla bean icecream and sugar glaze.  Very rich we couldnt even finish it but so delicious.    The bill arrived we were comped for everything but the drinks - 2 mocktails and a martini - $19.  Im originally from the east coast so this doesnt seem unreasonable to me for drinks and probably helps with limiting the clientele.  Im good with that.  But I really couldnt believe how Mark and our very nice waitress TRICIA!  Yes....  Tricia...  how they went above and beyond to make up for our experience.  Both of us ladies take our clients out regularly for lunches dinners and happy hours to entertain.  I want to try this place again before I bring a customer here (who can help but be a bit gunshy) but Im confident they have the right people in place to provide a positive experience and both of us will be back.  Again thanks Mark & Tricia for making it such a great evening for us.   Beautiful',4
'So I came here for a big group event.  They had us sitting in a nice private area.  The decor was very upscale Mexican with dimmed lighting throughout the restaurant.  The staffs were very courteous and helpful.  I ordered an Enchilada dish and it was pretty good for the price.  The ingredients used tasted fresh and prepared in a somewhat artsy fashion.   If youre in the neighborhood and looking for style Mexican definitely stop by here but if you seek authentic Mexican look elsewhere.  Overall it was just a purely good upscale Mexican experience.',3
'My older dog grew up as a Banfield dog in Tucson so when I got Elwood I wanted him to be a Banfield dog too.  I took him in for his first visit. We guessed within about a month of his age. Right around 6 months. The vet comes in looks over Elwood and tells us we have been duped and that Elwood is over a year old. Okay we had the dog for about 4 months prior to the visit and he literally doubled in size during that time and his little testes dropped too. Also we did not pay for Elwood even though he is a purebred so there would be absolutely no reason for this person to dupe us. This dog outgrew all of his clothes that we had bought for him initially. Okay we stopped the examination if she couldnt tell how old the dog was within reason then there was no way in hell she was capable of doing anything else with the dog. We went back to the people we got Elwood from and got the vet records from when his little tail was docked and their initial visit. He was 7 months old. The vet there is clearly inept and there is no way I would let her do ANYTHING with my dog. Telling us our 7 months old pup was well over a year old.',1
'I work really near this cafe and eat there a couple times a month usually I love that it is a mom and pop type of restaurant; the family that owns it are always extremely happy gracious and friendly.  The prices are great I usually get the Flying High special which has a LARGE Dragon Roll and a yummy salad with avocado and a great dressing.  The green tea is also fantasic.  The decor is cute and bright!',4
'I have to say after reading the other reviews IM SHOCKED! Ive been going to this Dees for a few years and have NEVER experienced what I am reading here. Strange...  The staff has been nothing but courteous and helpful! They greet us when we walk in and apologize if they are unable to get to us right away (serving other customers).  Theyve even come up to me to ask if I need help finding anything.  As with most retailers I avoid going on weekends. Stores in general are typically just too busy and I personally dont have the patience. Since I like to receive good customer service I try to pick the best days and times when I will likely receive it.  I wont argue that Dees prices seem high for many of their clothing items. However their shoes and dance tights seem comparable in price.  Making exchanges is super easy too.   Thats been MY experience.  I hope other helpers who have had pleasant exeriences here will post their reviews.',4
'I enjoyed my blowout on the morning of my birthday and it was indulgent!    My blowout experience began with the hostess offering me a beverage and when I heard I could select a mimosa from the selections I was giddy!  The mimosa was promptly delivered in a beautifully stemmed happy yellow colored cocktail glass.  I thought Id have to pay extra for this little slice of heaven but much to my surprise it was included in the measly $35 blowout price tag.  What a fun little addition!  Next in my experience came the greeting and introduction of my stylist.  She was friendly and engaged. I was asked to sit in my chair and she consulted with me on exactly what I wanted in an end product.  I changed my mind once during the consultation and my stylist made suggestions that I hadnt thought of which ultimately enhanced the look of the final blowout. The final decision was a blowout cocktail of the Mai Tai/Cosmo styles.  We then set off for the actual blowout which began with a heavenly shampoo.  I say heavenly because not only was I given a little stool to rest my feet on but I also received a very brief but awesome head massage.  The short little massage was completely unexpected but oh so good.    The final blowout result took around 45-60 minutes and the unveiling of my final look made me grin like a fool.  I looked into the mirror and saw a goddess thanks to the expertise of my stylist.  I couldnt believe how lush and feminine my hair looked.  It had beautifully placed waves and smelled like a mix of spring flowers and mens cologne (in a good way).    I honestly wish I could do this every week.  As I sit here two days later typing this review although not as full I still have soft wavy hair to enjoy.  When I say I wish I could do this every week I mostly say it because there isnt a Drybar close to home.  I live in Peoria AZ and the 40 minute drive to Scottsdale AZ would be too much every week.    Overall this was a 5 star experience and Ill happily return on another special occasion for another superbly done blowout.',5
'This is truly one of the best antique stores you can find here in the area. Since I work in aviation I appreciated the aviation collection in the store. Old airline memorabilia and they even had old drink stirrers! I like to collect old pilot jackets so I was thrilled with what they had.  I know this store is in Scottsdale and more expensive prices are expected but I really didnt notice anything outrageous. If anything the things that I wanted were reasonably priced and some old vintage purses that I was squealing over were only under 15 bucks.   The store is kept very clean organized air conditioned lit and there is ample space to move around without feeling like youre going to knock everything over. If you are looking for jewelry you will be pleased with the large selection they have of really nice fashion jewelry.   I like a lot of old antique furniture glassware and kitchenware and I am very pleased whenever I come here. We found this old high backed wheelchair that we could set up in our house like something out of the movie The Changeling. (We have a themed house thing going on)',4
'If I had a choice I would give this place no stars. Coaches are bullies when youre not looking.',1
'Best steak in phoenix. Yes this place will set you back quite a bit but if your in the mood for something that will clog your arteries then get ready.   I had the 12oz filet medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. It was served on a sizzling plate. My wife and I shared the lobster mashed potatoes which was ridiculous. It was swimming in a sea of butter by the way a little overkill but nonetheless delicious.  Desert is a no brainer. Order the butter cake best thing on the menu i promise you.   Overall I dropped about 175 bucks for 2 people without drinks but well worth it..',4
'Its Walmart. I enjoy the scenery...',3
'I thought this place was very good and considering we WERE going to go to the Persian Room thats saying allot! There was only one waiter for the place and he was not the most pleasant but he was quick responsive. Just wish he would have written the cost of the sodas on the tab. Nit-picking aside this place was great my boyfriend and i shared a combo plate and were both pretty full afterward. I would definitely go back.',4
'This place is excellent!  The patio was great to enjoy a delicious lunch our server was incredible and the food was fantastic!  The guacamole was tasty the agua frescas were refreshing and the entrees were delicious!',5
'I rarely write reviews so for me to sign up and write a review means it was THAT BAD!  Where to start...I paid over $40.00 for an oil change and upgraded car wash-when it was all said and done the interior of my car was not clean the side door panels hadnt been wiped off at all and my car started leaking some fluid. The mechanic kept trying to get me to pay for extra services...he would say I just noticed one thing... then when I didnt want to pay for that thing he proceeded to notice another thing and another thing. Additionally I noticed scratches on the outside of my car that I hadnt noticed before and my son witnessed one of the employees flashing gang signs. Needless to say even when my car was leaking fluid after my visit I wasnt about to take my car back...NOT EVER.',1
'Super shuttle can rot in hell. I made an online reservation pre-paid and was super psyched about the great $14 rate that would get me to my hotel. my plane came in early but i had to wait for my bags at baggage claim so i was about 10 minutes late for my 9:35PM pickup.    I go outside and am directed to the super shuttle dispatcher guy who i walk up to.  he half turns towards me but refuses eye contact as they are glued to the company cell phone that is scrolling something on the screen.  hi i have a reservation my name is erin... he takes a deep breath and asks again how i spell my last name and says yeah yeah 5 minutes and promptly walks away from me.   now my name is generally difficult for people to spell and i didnt get the sense hed actually been listening but i moved aside and took the opportunity to stretch my legs. a van pulls up about five minutes later. driver gets out says one mans name the man gets on and they drive away.  another van pulls up. i ask the guy if its the one im supposed to get on and he puts his hand up to indicate i should stop talking. umm okay.   so now its 10:20 (!!!!) and that dude goes on break when his coworker comes back. his coworker who just smoked an entire blunt.  more vans are coming and going yelling out street names and people just hop on. well i dont frigging know what street my hotel is near wtf?!  at 10:30 i approach the stoner and ask him when my shuttle is arriving.  his first question: did the other guy help you? i can sense that if i say yes he will immediately walk away. i say no. he looks up my reservation and oh magical no one called it in when i got to the stand 40 minutes ago. wow. spectacular. so i tell him the other guy told me five minutes and that i have a reservation and he goes there are no reservations and i thought you said no one helped you.  AAAAYYYYYYYYYYY!! after he tells me i will have to wait an ADDITIONAL 45 MINUTES i call the 800 number to have a screaming fit and that dude calls the stoner and asks him whats up and the stoner says im annoying and then i am told yet again that there are no reservations.  no reservations? i ask. why did i get a confirmation pick up time schedule and pre-pay online then? hmmmm?? no response to that but after a brief hold im told i can get on a bus in 15 minutes.    i got to my hotel at 11PM. sure its a $14 ride but thats not right.',1
'Great spot for coffee or tea in the morning. Very interesting choices. Very nice help. Lots of souvenir items too.',4
'What a nice treat and affordable too. The ice is fluffy just like the snow back home up north. The flavors range from classic to contemporary. The owner is a great guy and has a LSU banner up despite the fact he is from ASU BUSTED.',4
'I wasnt blown away by this place. Its another trendy restaurant in Scottsdale Quarter that has the feel of a Fox restaurant.   The menu is small and not very descriptive. The food is not anything out of the ordinary. Id describe it as interesting but not delicious. I ordered the roasted chicken because my waitress said it would be half a chicken so I assumed that there would be breast meat. Nope. A measly thigh and drumstick. Baby spinach saturated in sodium. Runny polenta.   Everything appeared very creative but tasted less than impressive. What a disappointment.   There seemed to be confusion among the waitstaff; several appetizers were presented to our table that we did not order...I wonder how much this affects TKs profit margin...they certainly make up for it with the frugal portion size.   Its not a place that Ill seek out again.',3
'Let me start out by saying...boneless buffalo wings are my weakness and I am in love with them!  That said...lets get to the review. This location doesnt really deserve even the one star they are getting.  First off I ordered my wings and buffalo chips online and actually requested them for an hour later.  So I get there right on time and end up waiting about five minutes.  Okay sure no problem right!?  Well I get my order and head home.  Once I get home though I realize they had given me boned instead of boneless wings.  Since Im not a fan of the regular wings I hopped in my car and proceeded back to the establishment.  I get there and they apologize and hand me the corrected order.  Well I walk outside and get in my car and decided I should probably check to make sure its right.  Well what do you know they give me the wrong flavor and of course its a gross flavor.  So I go back in told the cashier that it was wrong yet again.  She says but you asked for boneless.  Once that came out of her mouth I figured I wouldnt give them a third chance to screw up my order again so I asked for my money back.  She walks into the kitchen and after about 5 minutes of waiting she comes back with the manager.  The manager doesnt apologize or anything he just looks super annoyed that he has to take the time out to refund a customer.  Did I mention this was during lunch on a football packed Sunday?!  He proceeds to hand me a receipt to sign to show that Im just paying for the buffalo chips....ummm yeah right!  I let him know that the wings and the buffalo chips were both in the bag and then he starts gripping at the cashier.  Finally he figured out what the correct procedure was and informed me that the transaction was voided.  He then tries to hand me a $5 coupon for my troubles...needless to say it ended up on the floor as I was leaving.  Never again will I walk into that BWW or any of their other locations.  That one experience has ruined any chance of me returning.',1
'Its really 3.5 stars because I did like the ice cream but Im rating down versus rating up only because of the attitude I got from the lady behind the counter.  Anytime I get bad service it ruins my experience and it really turns me off.    The ice cream was good and they make their own... I had the rocky road w/c was good - can definitely taste the hint of scotch but it wasnt overwhelming..  I also had the mango margarita w/ tequila which was good too.. good margarita flavor.  I would have liked it more with less tequila and it may have made it better but for those that like their Cuervos it would be perfect!  They also have 6 non-alcholic ice creams for those that want to bring their kids along but dont expect a good treatment from the lady behind the counter because shes too afraid that their glass decorations might get knocked off from the shelves.  I would still go back mainly because I only need one more stamp to get a free ice cream but Ill cross my fingers and hope that there would be a different person behind the counter!',3
'are you all kidding me with these reviews?!  come on people have you never had decent itallian food?  hell i would settle for olive garden!    ive been to this place twice.  once about 6 years ago and just recently since they renovated or gave the place a face lift.  they cheep out on the ingredients the wine is super low end and the art they are displaying is hung so poorly it undermines the artists!  the staff is pleasant enough but i was almost run down by the delivery driver in the parking lot who btw threw me attitude when he had to get by me inside!  how dare i react to almost getting run over or at the very least bullied out of his way.  all i can say is use fresh fresh fresh...whenever you can and invest in a wine expert or hell even a few classes might do the trick.    oh yeah run over that delivery guy;)',2
'I called to make an appointment for my husband today.  First of all when I call the line was busy!  I called back 15 minutes later to be put on hold!  Once I got to speak to the scheduler I wanted to make an appointment for a established patient.  Because of my husbands work schedule they couldnt get him in until July 11.  Oh but wait because Dr Cardenas has left he had to have an appointment with another Dr. So it is considered a NEW patient appointment to establish with the new Dr.  So cant have that appointment until July 18.  Mean while there are prescriptions that need to be filled and they cannot be filled until July 18.  Lets hope my husband doesnt DIE while waiting to get these prescription refilled. SOLUTION: Dump Westline Family Medical Center and do somewhere where firstly the receptionist DOESNT SUX WITH ATTITUDE and go somewhere you can be seen timely.  We are changing Drs already got an appointment set up with Dr. Cippola down the road!!',1
'Its Staples.  What can I say?  Office supplies mostly.  And school supplies.  They have a decent range of products.  Nothing really that special.  I do like that they will give you a store credit for recycling ink cartridges.  Thats pretty cool.  Staff is reasonably friendly and helpful.  A good place to pick up basic supplies.  Ive never bought a big ticket item from them so cant comment on those (e.g. office furniture printers laptops etc).',3
'The number one reason why I like coming here is because their pizza is excellent and I love the atmosphere. The first time I came was for my birthday last year and they handled our large group very well. The second time was just for dinner with a friend and they allowed me to reserve a table for just 2 people which is great because I know it can get crowded. Im not a wine person but all the people I have brought with me here have assured me they have a great selection so there you go! Mainly I come here for their Margherita Pizza. I ask for it well done and its lovely browned & bubbly! They use lots of fresh basil like its supposed to have! Great intimate and romantic atmosphere. Prices are reasonable for the high quality food.',5
'My girlfriend collects robot toys and one of my best friends is a Spawn fanatic so I decided to take a look around. Although there werent many robots there was plenty more of everything else you can imagine when it comes to toys McFarlane created or not.  They had a small but vital comic archive for the Spawn fan and they offered hard-to-find or unique toys of all genres. Plenty to choose from and even the imports werent devastatingly expensive. This franchise specialty store can be appreciated by anyone who collects and even for those of us that want to take a look around. Pretty entertaining as a time killer for the masses or a Mecca for the few. I walked out empty-handed but with a curious smile on my face my friend on the other hand was pleased with the fare he found to support his hobby.',4
'Phil and his group are amazing!!! They make every experience worth every dollar spent',5
'Based on Yelp reviews my husband and I have been enjoying Lalibelas delicious food for several years.  We calendar in a visit every time we travel to Phoenix.  Havent had a disappointing meal. The first time we ordered the sampler platter.  It was huge and provided a terrific array of their tasty vegetable and meat dishes.  My current favorite is the spicy beef and chicken with a side of green beans and carrots.  My husband loves the meat combination.  My descriptions dont do the dishes justice.  The spice and flavor combinations are so deliciously wonderful.  Wish Lalibelas was closer to home.  We would eat there all the time.',4
'I Love Love (Let me repeat it once more for effect) LOVE this place.  I was invited out to brunch with a few people and was unsure about this place it was kinda hidden behind the home depot...in fact I missed it the first time I went there. Being a vegetarian I looked at the menu and noted almost everything had meat...which may be my only small issue with the place..the lunch is pretty meat based. HOWEVER!!! one beautifully glow point...they will take it out make exceptions and add things with no issue. Once they came out with it wrong it was taken off my bill immediately fixed apologized for and I have never had any issue with service. Actually haha Ive been in several time but my last visit was in August(Which this is where I demanded breakfast/lunch on my birthday). I walked in Saturday at 12:10 told them I needed to be out by 12:30 and they were incredibly accommodating. Made sure I was seated where I could read (I went alone) and the food was out by 12:20 so I had enough time to eat pay and leave. Also the waitress thought ahead and brought my drink in a to go cup. The (I believe) manager Kat remembered me from August! Execellent customer service Excellent Food and to the person who complained about prices...have you been to IHOP/Dennys Or Village Inn lately? Crackers is on the same level if not somewhat cheaper for some things. P.S. Try the tea & Bread Pudding! Its great and my vegetarian friends dont be afraid to tell them to subtract the meats. I always get the New Hampshire Skillet - No Meat add in tomatoes spinach mushrooms and it comes with broccoli. YUM!  )',5
'We found this place by using Google maps to see what breakfast places were near my car dealership. When I saw that its run by the same people that own Serranos I knew it would be good.  The place is small but big at the same time (if that makes sense). We didnt have to wait too long. The service was good our waitress was prompt and attentive for the most part.  The food was great. My husband got the basic farm scramble and when it got to the table he said Thank God for them their bacon is crispy. To which I replied Ha ha THAT is going in my Yelp review. Needless to say he enjoyed it.  I had the denver omelet. It was really good. The ham they use is actual spiral ham diced up not deli ham like a lot of other places.  We both made the mistake of ordering the biscuit instead of toast. It wasnt a mistake because it wasnt tasty no no. It was a mistake because it was HUGE. And pretty dense but still delicious.  If youre looking for a breakfast place in Chandler I recommend this one.',4
'I love this place. Its great for the following reasons:  1) super chill laid back feel 2) AWESOME jukebox 3) cheap drinks!! 4) you can actually have a conversation in there  So to go in a little more detail about point number 3... my first time there I ordered my regular at a new place whiskey and coke. The bartender pulled out a pint glass filled it 3/4 full with whiskey and charged me the price that small dixie cup drink at any bar in scottsdale would run you. FANTASTIC!  nuff said.',4
'Based on memory and a one-time visit Im giving this place 4 stars. Thats pretty damn fine if you consider how its been nearly 365 complete days since my first and only run in with Rosie.   All the way around it was a nice experience. Sure it was a Saturday night and the bar was crowded when my friend and I got there. So we took ourselves upstairs and out onto the patio. Great vantage point if you can tolerate smoking. I really like the interior of the place - almost feels like a basement with an escape hatch through the roof. Dont ask me why it makes me think of this. It could just be me...  I used to drive past Rosies on a regular basis and think I need to go there again. I never have made it back but that isnt any fault of the establishment. Rosies is a great pick for when youre in Central Phoenix. Definitely check it out. Youll probably leave with a great impression like I did. Only I hope youre not as absentminded as I am to never make it back there for a second round.',4
'Ive got alot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about Phoenixs latest venture into building serious public transportation.  Nice Thing #1: Mainly because its new the cars are really clean. After living in LA and using the metro subway there anything seems cleaner than that. Lets just hope they keep up the cleanliness of the light rail in the years to come.  Nice Thing #2: It gets me from A to B with little to no problems. It gets the job done. Also its one of Phoenixs more serious efforts at going green so its worth backing.  Nice Thing #3: All of the current downtown stops are well thought out. Once you step off something is always walking distance.  Nice Thing #4: The price of the all-day pass is worth it.  Nice Thing #5: Unlike public transportation in LA the light rail is generally on time and makes for a reliable means of getting around. There dont seem to be any car companies that are trying to choke-hold the city by shutting any stations down like they did in the 30s in LA.  The cons...  Bad Thing #1: The only logic in taking the light rail is that its essentially a car you dont have to park or fill up on gas. Its not that its slow but it really only goes slightly faster than the cars driving next to it in the street. Part of the sluggishness of the light rail stems from the fact that it has to stop at traffic lights like the cars you decided not to drive. I think the smarter idea wouldve been to build the light rail above or under ground so it could have gone faster and not have to stop at lights or risk the chance of some idiot gunning it and T-boning one of the passenger cars.  Bad Thing #2: I know this experiment is still in its training wheels stage but I really wish that they would build a line that would go to North Phoenix Scottsdale or Glendale. Ive heard that they are planning a Glendale route but thats probably going to take another ten years. Even though I live a few blocks from one of the stops I really wish I wasnt limited to downtown Tempe or Mesa.  Bad Thing #3: No airport stop? I mean there is but you have to take a shuttle to the actual airport. Why not just build a stop there? It would make more sense.  Bad thing #4: Why does this thing shut off at 11? Is Phoenix trying to kill any chance of building a real nightlife downtown? Were not children. This city shouldnt set a curfew before midnight on this.  In all the Valley Metro Rail is more yay than nay. Its got its kinks that it still needs to work out and its kinda tough to judge something thats in what I hope is a very nascent form of what it will eventually become.',3
'What a great place to chill  have some cold beer and some great food. One of my  favorite restaurants in the Valley. Make sure you try the spicy seafood pasta.',5
'Me: Can I have a large order of fries? Lady in speaker: we dont sell side of fries. Me: oh ok (knowing I just got some the week before) Lady in speaker: we have carne asada fries? Me: No thank you Lady in speaker: how about I just take the carne asada out? Me: That would be perfect thank you. (why couldnt she just do that in the 1st place?)  I get home.... theres road kill on my fries.  If it wasnt for their delicious chile relleno burros Id still be going to Taco Bell. You get what you pay for though and the service comes with it.',3
'I quite liked this place.  We went for a dinner with another couple.  Ordered a couple appetizers a couple beers a bottle of wine large pizza and 2 entrees.  The bill was over 100 but not too crazy.  The service was great.  Do not underestimate the size of these pizzas!  They are huge!  And delicious!',4
'Really did not like it here at all. Food was not particularly great either. I ordered a Ruben sandwich it had a weird aftertaste. I will not visit this place again.',1
'I like Ra only during happy hour because its more affordable then.  I love me some sashimi and Viva Las Vegas rolls I have yet to try more of the other RA creations but the prices for them are a little ridiculous to me to be completely honest.  I have gone to this location more than twice but not more than a handful of times. I think this past Saturday was another reminder of why I hate going to RA. Regardless of how busy it may be. I would have given the girl a break but it wasnt THAT busy!!  The things I normally ask for with my sushi I did not bother asking because our waitress was too busy gossiping with the hostess and flirting with the guys sitting a table over.  I havent had this bad of service in a long time It makes you really appreciate those that are good at what they do. I cannot expect too much its the Scottsdale location i kind of saw it coming but at the same time the fact that I didnt really want to ask the waitress for the essential things I usually ask for that isnt hard to handle at all is pretty bad. Because I knew in the back of my head that the broad would take a million years to come back because she had to tell her life story to every one on the way.    I am not one to bash a restaurant or business on the regular but it just seems like every where besides ATL wings in chandler I have been not only been getting the worst service ever out with friends but not so great of food either. After this visit I highly doubt I will ever return to any ra location out of my own pure choice and would most likely frown upon someone having the idea to go unless its for happy hour on sake. Thats the only way I would go back and if someone pulled my leg to go.',2
'Yikes is right! Unfortunately this is my home for the next 3 1/2 days. I already miss the Windmill Suites. First off it is a hike to get to your room. Second when you get to your room it certainly leaves you surprised and NOT in a good way. I look forward to returning to California. Hopefully I dont take any bed bugs with me.',2
'Nachobot no longer serves Nachos.  They have a re vamped menu and a new chef guiding the fare.  Not sure if it is any good I was in the mood for Nachos.  Their Nachos were creative and flat out great.  Ill not drop to 1 star but they dont serve Nachos any longer.  The Nachos almost all night was a great concept.  Well watch this space for developing news.',2
'After really enjoying a happy hour visit a few months ago we finally went by for dinner.  It was terrific with a few minor hiccups.  We arrived at 7 and were shocked to find a full parking lot and a line to get in.  Nonetheless we were seated within 15 minutes.  We really love the atmosphere here.  Dark urban and romantic with a kind of northeastern feel.  Drinks first.  We ordered a glass of red wine a whiskey sour and an old fashioned.  The red wine came right away.  About 5 minutes later the waitress stopped by and said hes looking for the ingredients for the other drinks.  Hmmm.  We amused ourselves for the next 10 minutes wondering how a bar could not have the ingredients for a whiskey sour or an old fashioned.  She returned with the whiskey sour and said He just doesnt have the ingredients for an old fashioned.  FYI here are the ingredients for an Old Fashioned: Bourbon Soda Water Sugar Bitters A cherry and an orange peel  We found this hilarious.  I changed my order to a Manhattan and that took about a minute to arrive.  Drinks here are large and strong.  Three of shared a steak tartare and ahi tuna app.  Both were excellent and the steak tartare was perfectly executed and presented.  The appetizers here really rock.  We ordered the three dishes that the waitress recommended a chile rellenos (from the old Robertsons menu which is also available) a chicken schnitzel and the beef tenderloin salad.    Dinner arrived and I took a bite of my chicken schnitzel.  Wow thats some soft chicken I thought.  Wait a second  - thats not chicken!  The cook had apparently unilaterally upgraded me to the sea bass.  Well no matter it was delicious.  All in all a terrific dinner.  Service is charming and very friendly and the drinks and food are very satisfing despite the occasional Fawlty Towers moments.',4
'Atmosphere - 4 stars as the mechanical bull was quite entertaining Service - 2.5 stars as they were not overly helpful with our big group event Food - 2 stars as it really was not very good',2
'Awesome place. Went here when I lived here with no expectations but thought it was really well done and really cool stuff here. Be sure to go once during the day and once at night. People of all ages will like this.',5
'Went there yesterday and found that the place has just CLOSED.  Another victim of a good chef with a bad location and business planning.    Hint for future restauranteurs:  Dont open a Scottsdale restaurant in the summer unless you have the cash to survive with no business till the following March advertise heavily and dont locate your business where customers coming from one direction have to make a U-turn to get there particularly if theres no good signage.  The Stacys location in Phoenix remains open.',5
'I have been here twice now and have experienced sub-par service and an overcooked omelet.  The first time I went to the restaurant the place was no more than a couple weeks old. We had to wait for a few minutes to be seated but that is to be expected as it is a new establishment.  After being seated and waiting for about 10 minutes we finally had a server come and introduce herself.  Since we had already sat there for 10 minutes we were both ready to order but right after we had placed our drink orders the waitress just sped off so we had to wait another 5 minutes. When the server came back I had ordered an omelet with potatoes.  The food came out about 15 minutes later and my omelet was burnt while the potatoes were cold.  I waited for a few minutes but our server was nowhere in site.  At this point I had become impatient and just ate the food and chalked it up to it being a new place and would come back a 2nd time to try it again.  About 2 weeks ago we finally decided to go back thinking all the hype should have died down and we should be able to get some decent service and food.  I was wrong.  We got seated and waited about 10 minutes for a server... again.  This time we made sure to order the food and then the drinks.  I ordered the same thing as i did the last time- an omelet.  The food came out while I was in the restroom so I didnt have a chance to see it while the server was there but the omelet was burnt... again.  Omelets are supposed to have some yellow to it but this thing was BROWN.  Anyways I came back waited for about 5 minutes only to see our server playing with a dog on the patio.  This went on for another 3 or 4 minutes and again I became a little upset at the fact that we had sat there for so long with minimal service so I started eating the omelet.  It was a good thing because she didnt come back until our plates were cleared.  Horrible service and sub-par food... again.  The atmosphere is really cool and the location is great.  I love to sit outside and people watch but I do like to eat a decent breakfast with some service more.  I understand this is the new trendy restaurant in Scottsdale but its going to lose fast if it doesnt start taking care of its customers.  There are plenty of other breakfast places in the area that have outstanding service with better food.  I suggest you look for those places.',2
'We went to Rehab for a late lunch today and while it started out with good intentions in the end we were extremely disappointed. On the bright side I loved the decor. Its very well done with the surfer vibe and the sweet potato tots are some of the best Ive had.   The real issues were coming out of the kitchen. As I was people watching I noticed tables coming in. I also noticed table by table food was coming out for them before ours. Shortly after we ordered our second round of drinks smoke did fill the small restaurant and we made jokes about our food being on fire so we chalked it up to our order actually being the cause of the smoke. It was a late lunch so by this time it was past well past 1 p.m. Our server cruised by and said we were waiting on the wings one of us ordered.  Finally the food arrived and it couldnt have been the wings since they were cold. Both burgers had burned pretzel buns and one side of tots was half a serving of cold tots. The server said he would bring more then never returned. The restaurant was quite busy so we took matter in our own hands and asked someone to bring the tots and fill our drinks but the burgers werent great. We ate them anyway because at this point we were just so hungry!  Finally we were waiting for our check to be split and who I assumed is the manager came by our table and asked how it was. We were honest and told him it wasnt great. He arrogantly replied Not great? But you ate all your food I looked at him and said Yeah because I waited a long time for my food while all these tables who came in after us were served their meals It was ridiculous I watched many of those tables leave as well while we were dealing with our tab.   He pressed the issue even though we didnt want to get into it because a) it seemed petty and b) we just wanted to leave but he insisted . We told him our issues with the meal and 10 min later he returned with the food removed off the menu. The weirdest thing was his delivery. He pinned the checks on the table facing us so we could read it and goes How are we doing this holding our cards in his hand. I  pointed to my check and said Im the blue card so thats mine He just stared at me. I repeated Im the blue card and reached over to pull the card out of his grip and he goes Okay so the $2 on the blue card and the $6 on the red card   It was sooo rude. His demeanor was that we were being ungrateful when we honestly just wanted to leave. When he returned he was full of excuses (were a new restaurant we are very busy etc.) which is FINE. I eat out all the time and new restaurants all the time and I expect growing pains so I told him I liked the place I would be back to watch a game grab a drink. He replied Well we are not a bar with good food. We are a restaurant with good drinks.   What the hell? First of all I wasnt even drinking so I was just trying to be NICE. Thanks for not taking our constructive criticism YOU ASKED FOR then making us feel BAD about the discount you gave us that we werent looking for. It was such a turn off we talked about it the whole ride home and all day Ive been telling people what a nightmare it was when they asked me about it due to me checking in on social media  So I lied to the manager... I wont be back. There are plenty of other mediocre burger shops around town that I can give my business to and if I do end up there again Ill be ordering the wings and tots. Their burgers are average. For a place with BURGER in the name there is just absolutely nothing special about their signature menu item. Shoulda gone to In N Out.',2
'My last experience at The Breakfast Club will be just that my last.  Living downtown I try and support downtown business and frequent establishments within walking distance of my condo.  Ive had a few positive experiences here and  more than a few negative experiences but my girlfriend likes the place (or she used to anyway) so when she comes downtown for the weekend we make the trek here.    The food is average somethings are well done (good Bennies) some you could get just as good or better almost anywhere.  I can name at least 5 breakfast places in Phoenix that I feel have better food at a more competitive price.  The drinks used to be what kept me coming back as I felt this place had one of the best Bloody Marys in town.  My last experience here was a total let down and I should have known something was up when our server asked if we wanted spicy or non-spicy when we ordered our drinks a question that has never been asked once in the nearly 2 years Ive been ordering drinks here.  My non-spicy tasted totally different than anything Ive been served there and not in a good way.  My girlfriends spicy tasted like someone added a pound of horseradish to it.  The drinks are also way over priced $10 for a large and $7 for a small I have no problem paying premium price for a premium product but these no longer fit in that category.    The staff is what solidified my decision to cross this off the list of places I frequent as Ive only read about service this horrible and never actually experienced it myself until now.  Ill start off by saying the service at the Downtown Breakfast Club has always been hit or miss with many more misses than hits.  Some of the waitstaff has been very good most has been not so good.  Im really not that hard to wait on....take my order bring me my food refill my water check in once to see if everything is OK and you can expect a good tip.  To illustrate my last visit heres a timeline:  Checked in with hostess for party of 2 was told 20-30 minutes.  Waited almost an hour and watched a total lack of control or caring as people would just walk up and seat themselves at the outdoor seating and nothing would be said by the staff.  If the outdoor seating is a free for all like sitting at the bar just let me know and Ill seat myself.  Finally had a table waited 10-15 minutes before our server came over.  Luckily we knew what we wanted so we ordered our drinks and food right away.  Bloody Marys took about 15 minutes to get to us and food was another 20-25.  Once the food arrived we asked for ketchup which I feel is a fairly simple request and the server said she would be right back with it.  Apparently right back to her means 15 minutes and when she appeared with it and we total her to forget about it since we were already 80% done with our food she seemed a bit put off that we would have the audacity to ask for something and not bow at her feet when she got around to getting it to us.    Was the food good would you like more water can I get you anything else??  Dont ask our server because she wouldnt know not once did anyone stop by our table and ask even one of these basic questions.   My advise to the owner of this establishment would be kill it with fire.  This location is destroying your brand and had I never been to the Scottsdale location I would never have given this one as many chances and I have.  I would rather eat stale Fruity Pebbles with month old milk then eat here again.',1
'Terrific store. Always perfect service and all the candy addiction throughout my childhood. A must visit for any age.',5
'What a midweek treat.   Georgie S and I met here after work on Wednesday to enjoy their happy hour special: $4 beer and a few select cocktails. I had arrived a bit early so I dove face-first into a pomegranate margarita. Nice good but a bit too sour for my tastes; nevertheless I dont regret trying it. Afterwards I moved to my trusted BFF Guinness. :doe eye:   The appetizers are half off which was a treat since they arent exactly cheap. But its not your typical happy hour fare. This is high class/high class like let you meet mama and introduce you to papa. After laboriously narrowing our choices down to one a piece Georgie and I decided on the teriyaki tenderloin and grilled jumbo scallop lollipops. Both were melt-in-your-mouth good.   We both had two beers and our bill was around $35. However Christina P received a $20 gift card. She wasnt able to use it before it expired so gave it to Robert M. He is out of town on business this week so he gave it to Georgie. As the card was being redeemed it was showing there was no balance on it; had someone snarkily used the balance of the card and passed it along? Hork imagine the possible hours of dramady! But alas the card turned out to be valid so with tip our evening was $11 each (with tip) for a fine afternoon.',4
'The first thing you notice when you visit this no-kill sanctuary is how clean peaceful and well organized it is. Every bunny is well cared-for and has a goodly amount of space for their pen thanks to efficient placement and organization. The staff and volunteers make it a point to know each bunny e.g. personalities likes/dislikes etc. to the point where they attach a diagram of bunnys pen layout (they like their dish over here their hiding place over there etc.) to the front of their pen so that volunteers know where everything goes when they clean the bunnys space. And every bunny gets groomed petted fed watered loved and properly tended. The staff and volunteers are dedicated to finding each bunny a happy and safe forever home and dont just give bunnies to anyone who asks. They make sure that you really want the bunny and will be able to take care of it as it deserves. Tranquility Trail Animal Sanctuary can and should serve as a model for all other animal rescues as they truly love these creatures and are well-schooled in how to care for them and take time to answer any questions new bunny owners have. These bunnies are not just a bunch of homeless critters - They are all members of their bunny family. If you are looking for a bunny please adopt one instead of buying one and please give one of the many adorable bunnies from this sanctuary a chance to be a part of your family. Tranquility Trail also has a handy store on the premises that is well stocked with quality items you need for your bunny at prices significantly less than pet stores. And every penny goes directly back to the sanctuary bunnies I aopted my bunny from them and will do so again in the future. In Yelp-ese 5 stars means Woohoo! As good as it gets! and it really truly is.',5
'This In-N-Out isnt as busy as the ones in Chandler and Tempe which is nice since you can get your order made quicker as a result. Service is fast and friendly like the others and our animal style fries and burgers were piled on with toppings very nice! It looked like they added more fries to our order than at the other locations which I appreciated. The only negative for me was that the A/C here runs very cold so the cheese on our fries congealed into a cold mass soon after we got our order. Boo for cold cheese on fries!',4
'Great place to come and sit outside for an after meal dessert with coffee/tea--or your morning coffee/tea and pastry. There is something for everyone.  Fruit tarts brownies and pretzel bread are my personal faves. My kids get a FREE cookie when they come with me! Coffee and tea is full-service and the staff are always accomodating for special requests. Patio is lovely; service (counter only) is efficient and amiable.',4
'I just switched OB offices and it was the best switch ever! Im on my 4th little one and Mary (Nurse Practitioner) was great!!

Great office atmosphere everyone is fun and helpful and they plan your appts if possible 3 months in advance!',5
'I love you Rubios. today it was your shrimp salad with avocados black beans corn and a lovely vinaigrette. Always a fan and today was no exception - clean as usual so thank you so very much!!',4
'Ive heard a lot of raving reviews and yes the burgers are pretty good (for the price).  When I received mine the bottom half of the bun was really cold and it did not arrive the way I asked.  After the meal I ordered a frozen custard mixer.  That also wasnt given to me the way I ordered it.  When I told them they left out one of my choices of toppings they decided to throw the entire thing away and make me out to be a jerk when I wasnt trying to at all.',2
'Meh. I get the novelty of the place but it just wasnt for me. I would say a little overpriced but location location location. I would charge the same for that area. People will pay it so why not charge it. We are outside and it was a nice atmosphere but that wasnt enough for me. I had a brat and it was decent but to be honest Ive had better that Ive made myself. The hamburger order was wrong that they brought me the first time. They brought me the right burger and it was decent but not worth the price tag. Their garlic fries on the other hand were pretty delicious.',2
'$2 Tuesdays. Sign me up.   For a second-run theater that doesnt have a gimmicky theme this really is as good as it gets. Pollack Tempe Cinemas is a great place to catch a movie and still get the theater experience. Its even better than a couple of first-run theaters in the valley that Ive been to.  Everything about the place reminds me of the movie theaters I used to frequent as a kid in the 80s. The theater may not have stadium seating or an amazing sound system but youre paying a fraction of the price to see a movie in a big clean auditorium so why complain. The life-size figures of movie characters add a fun vibe to the place and they actually encourage you take your picture with them. Concession prices are on par with any movie theater.   Im a big movie lover but like a lot of people Ive switched over to Netflix and Redbox for the majority of my motion picture viewing. But if Im home on a weekday summer afternoon and theres a movie that came out a month or two ago that I know I want see why not check it out for just a few bucks?   Heads up to the never carries cash crowd... No credit or debit taken at this joint. Make sure theres some paper in your wallet.',5
'I miss Manila Café from the early 2000s the little Filipino joint that used to be at this location a little pocket nudged into the strip mall on the southwest corner of Alma School and Elliot. I love lumpia though--the Filipino version of the egg roll its biggest difference coming from the thin crisp wrapper as contrasted to the thick doughy wrappers used with Americanized Chinese egg rolls. Thus it was easy to be drawn to Manila Cafés replacement.   For a place called the Lumpia Factory though the lumpia pickings are usually sparse when Im there and those that Ive had arent quite my style--cigarillo-thin and filled only with meat they left me yearning for Moms big fat lumpia elegant ample savory and home. That aside the food here can be pretty good!   Shove some storage boxes aside shift the somewhat awkward and somewhat heavy tables and chairs so you can actually sit at them without having to be as thin as a stick figure (they dont mind that their clientele shifts tables and chairs around to suit their parties which is usually families of various sizes) then step up to the hot plates nestled into the steam table to see the 8-10 dishes offered on that days menu--it changes daily but is usually the same from week to week. Whoever Ive run into manning the counter has been polite downright friendly and eager to please (and answer any questions for those of you novices). Point through the glass at what will usually be stewing meats or soups braised meats and vegetables sometimes unusual parts of common animals (tripe anyone?) and set up your plate--a combo with two or three items with a serving of rice--and the counter help will bring it to you in Styrofoam plates and bowls.   If youre Filipino or have affection for the cuisine chances are your pick will hit the spot or at least come close. Of course if youre like me and compare the food to moms cooking youre bound to find something to take issue with but if you enjoy it for what it is--home-style comfort food from a culture whose food is far too ignored and therefore hard to come by then youll be pleased and maybe even get all nostalgic.   If youre new to Filipino food you can start easy with one of their adobo dishes lumpia and a pancit dish which is the Filipino equivalent of Chinese lo mein--you cant go wrong with noodles! No matter who you are try halo-halo for dessert--this is at the heart of Filipino desserts!',3
'Go here for happy hour.  fundido with veggies an elote 2 fish tacos 1 carne asada taco 1 cochinita taco 1 veggie taco tres leches cake 6 drinks (pear mojitos and margaritas)  $61.00  I think that is a pretty good price for two people who left completely stuffed. Not to mention all of the flavors in these dishes were spot on!!! The cochinita taco was my absolutely favorite taco. If I could go back I would definitely get the fundido again with veggies an elote and more cochinita tacos no questions asked. If I had room...let me rephrase...I would make room for the tres leches cake.  Atmosphere was trendy and modern  I did read that a lot of people had trouble with service. I was just there last week and we had great service. We were attended to right away had water and drink refills without asking and our server was really personable and on the ball. I have not one complaint about service.',4

'My wife and I both like Korean food.  We went to Hodori for the first time yesterday.  The food we ordered was very good.  The last time we went to a Korean restaurant worth mentioning was a place in Nashville TN (Antioch TN) called Hai Woon Dae.  This place ranks comparable to that.    I ordered Dalk Bulgogi (Chicken Bulgogi) and it was good.  The chicken tasted very fresh.    My wife ordered Soon tofu with pork.  She liked the soup.    All of the common sides that were brought out to us were very good also from the kimchi to the eggplant to the bean sprouts.  My wife and I will go back to this restaurant.',4
'Yes I know Macayos is a chain....but I like it...so sue me!  They do a good job with the classics and it is fairly consistent.  I go there for happy hour once a month with a group of people and we always get great service.  The salsa is addicting and the half price appetizers at happy hour are a great deal!  The mini chimis the spinach con queso and the cheese crisp are my favs.  I usually just end up getting a cheese crisp with a side of beans...and it comes out to like $6!  I also really like the Baja Shredded Beef Chimi....the meat is really tender and flavorful and then it is covered in the creamy baja sauce...heaven!    I like to go for lunch during the week too because they have great lunch specials....I am a fan of the Tostada Grande...which is basically a tostada the size of a dinner plate!  So if I am in the mood for a classic standard...Macayos fits the bill.',4
'Im not a dessert person so really should not be reviewing this place but what the hay.  Its a pretty simple concept.  You grab a bucket and fill it with whatever soft serve frozen yogurt you want then put all kinds of toppings on it yourself.  They weigh the thing and you pay something like 39 cents an ounce.  The good thing about the weighing part is you can see directly how much unnecessary junk you are putting into your body but by that time its really too late to turn back.  When you eat your creation you will probably ask yourself why you made the choices you made which will lead to an introspective search.  For me a recent trip to Mojo brought back my earliest memories of eating Reeses pieces and watching E.T.  So I will say that this place has been therapeutic in reliving childhood memories.   As for the yogurt itself Meh.  Its nothing to write home about.  The stuff seems edible enough but still comes out of a machine in an unappetizing and hard to manipulate tube-like stream.  The lighting and decor inside provides just enough distraction.  On my recent trip the toppings area was also kind of disheveled by prior messy customers.  Call me a buffet-hater but any time I have to reach under a glass sneeze guard to self-help myself to a communal troth of food I cant help but lose my appetite just a little.  It met my (low) expectations but like I said Im not a dessert person.',2
'Okay you got me. I like crappy beer. I like places that serve crappy beer cheap. I really like places that serve cold crappy beer cheap  Im in Chandler for a couple of nights for work. I want to drink cheap cold crappy beer without a lot of hassle without driving to Tempe and all its temptations so I can get to bed at a decent hour for work tomorrow. I also flew in on an early flight today so Im pretty beat in general.  I searched Yelp for a while and picked this place. Was it momentous stupendous and fascinating? No.  Did I get a bunch of $2 Miller Lites $3 tacos (pretty terrible but edible) good service Monday Night Football and baseball and more for under $20? Yes. An emphatic yes.  Apparently this place isnt crowded on Mondays any more and the three bartenders have learned how to serve the ten people who were there at the bar (based on the crappy reviews I read).   Man I have been many worse places in the Valley of the Sun and paid a lot more for worse food beer and service.  Will I be back a couple of times more on this trip and future trips to Chandler? Yes. Will I make a special trip if Im not in Chandler? No. And thats okay.  And so is the Stadium Club.',4
'What a relaxing afternoon. I took advantage of New Serenity Spas massage/facial combo package. From the moment I walked in the door of New Serenitys new location I felt peaceful and increasingly relaxed. The decor of the reception area got the process started. From the soothing and beautiful water fall to the stunning scenic photography on the walls I could have sat in the reception area for a half hour and never got bored. I was greeted with kindness and a cup of cold water and within minutes I was in the massage room getting pampered from head-to-toe. Kristina is a skilled and intuitive massage therapist with a warm and caring personality. My tension-filled lower back got lots of TLC and felt so much better by the end of the massage. After 60 minutes of massage bliss I was given a fluffy robe and slippers to slip on so I could move next door to the facial room. Christine gave my stressed-out skin lots of caring attention. The hydrating products she used felt wonderful and smelled incredible. I loved the way she massaged the products in with careful circular motions. My face felt just fabulous. I will definitely go back for the spa/facial combo and I saw lots of other services on menu that sound verrry interesting. Thanks so much for taking good care of me Kristina and Christine.',5

'RUN FAR FAR AWAY! TERRIBLE!  If I could give negative stars I would. I ordered a pizza the BOY answers the phone in a hurry didnt ask how I was going to pay didnt take my credit card info didnt verify my phone number told me it would be 15-20 minutes I asked if he needed further directions for the driver b/c its in an apt- he said no AND told me it would be $15.90-something. The delivery driver ended up getting lost b/c the guy had the wrong address 42 minutes later the driver arrives after I gave him directions he expected cash which I did not have. I wanted to pay with my card. The driver left the pizza with me and goes back to the store. The manager calls and wants payment; I have no problem with that BUT when I told him what all happened he TOTALLY froze stuttered his words and was completely USELESS! Its absolutely pathetic that this KID is a manager. Its like Fisher Price opened a pizza shop and hired him. He has NO idea how to talk to someone.  OH! and he gave me the wrong # to corporate... coincidence? --- and my pizza was cold. ugh.  Harold the delivery guy was super awesome guy. He owned up to the mistake apologized offered excellent customer service even though it wasnt his mistake. Nice job Harold!  Now waiting on a call back from corporate and the district manager.  Dear Donavan Your management skills or lack theyre of are some of the worst Ive ever experienced. I would almost rather pay your college tuition than for you to ever handle an adult situation again. Dont ever EVER lie to a customer. You will always get caught... sorry had to call your corporate on ya. Shouldnt have done that sir. CHEERS.',1

'lets put it this way its a slum. since iv lived here iv gotten BED BUGS which i didnt even know existed in Arizona. i learned i had them after being chewed up from head to toe and only figured out what was causing these horrible red bumps all over my body after i saw numerous apartments in my building being treated by pest control. I have also found syringes several times throughout the property which i reported to police. Another grievance i have against this dump is the complete lack of security i was nearly assaulted on two separate occasions just going out to my car at night. there has also been break-ins and half the locked gates can be pushed open. iv had to call the police on squatters sleeping on the property before as well and the police are here nearly every week. on top of it all the walls are PAPER THIN you can hear everything going on in the surrounding apartments from arguing to using the bathroom its disgusting. the pool is usually green and when its not its flooded by people who dont even live at the complex.  YOU ARE BETTER OFF LIVING ANYWHERE BUT HERE. PROMISE.',1

'I stayed at this hotel last night and we had a great stay. We were celebrating my friends birthday and didnt want to drink and drive. So we booked this hotel on Expedia for under $100/night (2 bed suite) because of its price and location to the clubs in Scottsdale. The room was remodeled and looked fabulous the check in process was extremely easy and the staff were very helpful. We walked to all of the nearby clubs (literally in the parking lot of this hotel). Will stay here again for sure! But next time Ill make sure to get up early and eat at the awesome continental breakfast. Wow looked like a really nice eat in kitchen!!',5
'Friendly service.  Good atmosphere.  I usually sit in the bar with several TVs with some form of sports playing God forbid I have to keep up in a conversation.  Greek salad is my favorite.  The meatball trio from the appetizer section is great.  The cheese they use on top is quality.  Im pretty sure I could eat a bowl of melted cheese with some sauce alone.  The sauce on the pizza was a bit on the sweet side but doable.  The sandwich was good.  The calzone was good enough to be revisited.    Their hot Italian sausage is awesome.  Pasta with vodka sauce was very good.',4
'dinner is unremarkable but decent. if youre looking for typical pub grub food then this is a good choice. the staff is very friendly.  the happy hour is definitely the way to go with specials on food and drinks from 4-9 - im not used to the generous hours on the specials.',3
'This place had pretentious written all over it when I read up before I met up with my friends.  A catwalk?  Video screens while I dined?  I imagined sub-par food in Nicole Richie portions and P. Diddy prices.  What do I wear???!!!  Should I take modelling lessons before attempt the catwalk?  My husband needs new shoes.  Damn I better take care of that hangnail before dinner...and then I remembered oh yeah Im in Phoenix!  Having dinner out on a Sunday night!  I gotta relax.    Still my husband and I put on the hippest clothes we owned and we drove through Old Town Scottsdale.  Its been completely changed since I last came through here.  Chi-chi boutiques and high end restaurants dominate amongst the now less dominant cowboy boot shops and novelty hot sauce stores.  Not to say that all the southwest flair is gone but the jet set will definitely feel comfortable here and no longer see it as kitschy.    So the catwalk - interesting concept not as intimidating as I thought.  I could hear the old school Charlies Angels theme song playing in my head as my friends and I walked through it.  The inside looked like some club from L.A. or Vegas.  Hip trendy and over the top.  And even on a quiet Sunday evening before Christmas the few patrons this spot attracted were indeed dressed like they had stepped off the pages of Vogue.  (Thank God I took care of that hangnail.)    So the food - surprisingly delicious and generous portions and just a bit more reasonably priced than a comparable L.A. hot spot.  A majority of our party of eight was more than satisfied with the food.  We had a good start with the parmesan garlic fries (not too garlicky - so much more smooch friendly than the title lets on) and the assortment of breads with the honey butter was no ordinary afterthought.  I took a gamble with the short ribs as I have found that to be too rich or too salty of a dish at most restaurants but theirs was perfectly seasoned and a healthy portion for a growing girl like myself.  I also ordered the chopped salad and it could have rivaled any fresh salad I could get in sunny California.  It wasnt overly dressed and had a surprise secret weapon:  dried cherries!  Yum.  Some of my other friends ordered sea bass salmon halibut and all of them came with yummy accompaniments and the fish was fresh and cooked just right.  The chocolate cake they described on the menu sounded special but it was nothing but your typical chocolate lava cake (soooo over it) but at least it was well done; I just feel like I was fooled into thinking it was something else.    Some good wines by the glass.    Minus one star because the service was a bit off that night.  My salad came out at the same time my main course did and the waitress didnt apologize for it until I made a comment.  Then when she offered to split the checks three ways we waited 30 minutes (serious!).  And it still wasnt divided up correctly.  Dont offer if you cant deliver.  We could have worked out the bill amongst ourselves at a fraction of the time.    Overall it was a good time and the food was pretty good.  I dont know if I would request to dine here again but if someone suggested it I wouldnt put up a fight...especially if I got some new couture for Christmas.',4
'I like this place great food nice people. I highly recommend going here for the lunch specials they are $6.95.',4
'This is owned by the same people who own Ocean Club up in Kierland.  Great food very good service.  Wonderful ambience.  The steaks were excellent.  I dont know about the best steak in the valley but definitely one of anyway.',5
'My review might be biased as Im not a downtown chic bar kinda guy.   First off the music sucked. It was loud and obnoxious hip hop. Not the kind of music Id expect at a classy place that squeezes their own juices and crafts so many cocktails.  The bartender whom took my orders was slow to notice me standing at the bar and seemed to want to shoo me out by closing my tab and running my card without asking me.  The prices were probably average for an upscale bar. Martini cocktail and a stout beer were $25. I would never expect to pay that much at a bar but hey! When youre over a Pei Wei you gotta be a classy joint! Pay accordingly.   All in all I would never come here on my own.',2
'Why bother to ask what kind of sauce I want for nuggets at the time of order if you arent going to add them to my bag at the drive-thru window. Not just isolated either its EVERY time.  I always have to remind them about the sauces even though its on my order ticket.  I cant even remember a time when they got my order 100% correct.  Took my son there today.  Time was around 2pm so not busy at all.  Went through the drive thru.  Ordered a mighty kids meal for a BOY and when asked what kind of sauce for his nuggets I specified sweet n sour.  Also ordered a #1 combo with diet coke.  Think thats a pretty simple and straight foward order right? Well of course I get to the window and no sauce in the bag so I ask for the girl for some sauce.  Hand my son his mighty meal and he freaks out because they gave him a princess toy!  This is not good!  So I have to now park and go inside just to swap the darn toy!  I sure hope that management reads these reviews so they can make the changes needed.',2
'Stopped by to try the new Grilled Chicken Salad Sandwich it was good however the drive thru speaker needs to be updated because the guy taking me order could not hear me and I had to yell (not good). I have also had the Fish Fillet sandwich here and it was good too; it has been years since I had one of their beef sandwiches and I dont think I can eat one now that I know what a good Roast Beef sandwich taste like. But their Market Place options are quite tasty give them a try.',3
'Great people who are very good at teaching yoga and helping you get the most out of your practice. They also provide great workshops to help with hard poses. I highly recommend them!!!!',5
'A very quiet library.  It lacks media services of a Glendale Public Library (more extensive childrens section Blu-rays video games etc).  It is a good place to play my Vita though.',3
'Okay I am confused...one day I get the best deal in town another day the prices are higher than AJs. I purchased green and yellow squash and it was $.40 per pound more than any other grocery I shop and not a sale any where. Yes they do carry some items I have a hard time finding. It is not a one stop grocery store so I find myself still having to make 1 or 2 other stops. The good part is the herbal/vitamin area has knowledgeable staff that can help you get what you need. The rest of the staff is spotty asmto being helpful or not - depends on the day of the week or the mood of the day.  I ll still shop there occasionally for a few items - particularly gluten free. I hope they do the retrain on some and get the group humming with a higher customer service attitude.',2
'Why did it close???????',4
'They ruined my hair! I asked for it a little shorter around my face and they cut a HUGE chunk from one side of my head - about 3-4 inches wide! I got it cut because I had an interview the next day. I was in tears all day. It took two hours and three calls to even get the manager to call me back. They refused to pay for me to get it fixed elsewhere insisting instead that I let them try and cut it again - NO THANKS.',1
'I have visited this locale on a few occasions now and I must say there is nothing like it in all the Valley and perhaps the state itself. They host tons of events throughout the year and the YELP party that was held here in 2010 was EPIC. I highly recommend going at night....but watch for the critters.....LOL...both animal and human....LOL. There doesnt have to be an event there to go visit though....if you just want some peace and quiet....enjoy a beautiful sunrise or sunset.....or just take a romantic stroll with that special someone.....then this is your place. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!!!!',5
'Quite frankly this establishment if you like absolutely tasteless overpriced vegan hippie food with all the attitude of hipster lassez faire service.  This is the place to go...',1
'This is the best buffet in Az. HUGE variety from veggie dishes fish shrimp mussels and even sushi. The quality of food is very good too. One thing I have learned is when looking for good Asian food look inside! This place is always full of beautiful asian folks so you know its good. Just sayin. For a buffett they have a really nice staff. There is a shrimp dish with a sweet cream sauce that is amazing. It is more pricey than most asian buffets but well worth the extra few bucks. I eat here at least once every couple weeks.',5
'Stopped in for a while before heading to the airport. Great deals on Tuesdays and pretty decent bar food. The bartender was super nice and engaging. It was in the middle of the day so Im not sure how the night time scene is.',3
'this sandwich shop is one if the best Ive been to. The best ones that Ive had are the slaw be jo Cole turkey and the pastrami very good. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes sandwiches.',5
'3 1/2 Stars...first time here! Atmosphere is lacking but if you want a good sandwich this is the place in Mesa. Really good Turkey sandwich...REAL turkey breast...not deli thin sliced turkey. Wonderful green chili mayo on homemade bread. Yum!! Sweet potato fries really good. Strawberry/peach cobbler w/ice cream was really tasty...not too sweet. Ordered the spiked fresh squeezed lemonade w/prickly pear syrup and vodka. Unfortunately they really skimped on the vodka! Will definitely return but will ask that they actually put some vodka in the lemonade.',3
'OMG...this place its amazingly good!  Every pieces of sashimi its just melt in our mouth. This place is very cozy not fancy but the foods are out of this world.   Besides serving fresh fishes the chef is very knowledgeable of his products and the waitresses are outstanding.  Thank you for the delicious meal Hiro Sushi you really deserved the five stars from me! For dinner of two adults and one kid the meal come to $181.42 plus tips.  All of us were stuffed and happy!',5
'Went back to Centurion after a wonderful day at the San Tan Wheelie Jam.  My friend and I were famished from all of our bike riding.  I called shortly before we left my house and made a reservation.  When we arrived they seated us at a sofa which was ok for drinks but we requested to be moved to a table for our entrees.  They waitstaff was accommodating.  I got an item thats not on the menu but was recommended by our server at my first visit to Centurion: gnocchi with white Irish cheddar sauce.  The waitress had to check with the chef who said he would make it.  Oh rich yummy goodness!  My friend had a pizza and as on a previous visit I felt I had the better experience by ordering their pasta.  Our waitstaffers were relaxed and flexible on this Saturday night.  Once again I had a wonderful dining experience at Centurion.',5
'This is my favorite place to eat in Arizona and Im a native. Ive been here almost 32 years and I just love coming here.  I came here once with my wife and then several months later with some coworkers. I had the same waiter (great guy with the pony tail) and he remembered what my wife had ordered months back. I couldnt believe it.   The bar is top notch. They make the best Manhattan in the valley.  This is real Italian food folks. Of course there are some negative reviews because well some people just like The Olive Garden. You cant please everyone. If you like going to The Olive Garden this place isnt for you. If you like to feel like you just discovered a gem in Sicily for the first time definitely come to Tomasos.  Its nice enough to celebrate Valentines Day or an Anniversary here but also cool enough to go with a group of guys to get some drinks and eat for a few hours ... Yes you can literally spend hours here eating and drinking. They always make you feel like family.   Jason',5
'I need to know the hours of operation......',5
'Upgrading this place 1 Star.  Over the past couple of years weve dropped by here after a game (Suns/Dbacks/Rattlers).  Its a fun place to come and hangout and have a nightcap.  After Rattlers games the team will come and party with the fans in the back room.  Those guys are super cool and the atmosphere is fun.  Return Factor - 75%',3
'I used to think Americas Taco Shop was the best but I was wrong.  I found Taco heaven here.  I get take out here about once per month.  Ive had the chicken street tacos carne asada burrito.  You can mix and match anything on the menu and they are cool with it.  Ive never dined in but it is a very sleek casual design.  The staff is really friendly and it seems like its a family-run dining room.  And its super reasonable prices.',5
'Good Pad Thai! Throw alittle soy sauce on it even better Pad Thai. Good service. The server always twist my arm to do Saki bombs.',4
'Bippity Boppity Bacon. I wonder how Jim Gaffigan would feel about this cute lil joint?  When you walk in through the main entrance you will notice the lovely patio and a walk up window (love it) where you can place a take-out order. Creative but if you are going to wait for your order I would recommend snagging one of the four seats at the inside counter where you can enjoy a coffee or espresso drink and salivate at the delicious-looking pastrie some of which are bacon flavored.  The walls are painted bright yellow green and orange with fun wall art of various pigs. In addition to the four counter seats there is plenty of seating between the green booths and tables but if you have a party of five or larger your only option is to push together the tables and sit in the uncomfortable looking wood chairs. Luckily I was just there with my madre so we got to enjoy a comfy booth.  We were greeted and seated immediately by friendly staff and a few seconds later our waitress greeted us and took our drink orders. I ordered a latte that wasnt anything special (no latte art either) but hey they dont advertise about their espresso so no biggie. I opted for their half of sandwhich and soup or salad deal. I chose their BLT with applewood smoke bacon and a side salad just so I dont clog up all my arteries. My mom went for the full BLT sandwhich with sweet potato fries. There area few bacon options to choose from like: applewood smoke honey cured sugar cured peppered and jalapeno bacon but our server suggested to stay with the classic applewood smoked so we listened. The sandwich was pretty tasty and they dont skimp on the yummy bacon the side salad was boring and basic but the sweet potato fries were delicious good choice mom!  All in all good service decent food reasonable prices. I would come back and try their bacon pancakes which is what the server said they are known for but Im not in any rush. FYI: This place closes at 2pm everyday and isnt open at all on Tuesdays.',3
'The rooms are nice (for this brand of Marriott) but the service was pathetic.  It may have just been the girl who checked me in but thats all it takes to make an impression.  It will be the last time I give them my business.',2
'This is my second time at SaBai. The first was for dinner; this time was for lunch. I was very impressed both times by the ambiance the service and most importantly the food. This restaurant was started by a young local couple and they really seem to know what they are doing. They obviously put their heart into their business and care about the customers.  For dinner I had the Prik King with chicken. It was incredibly flavorful  and the portion size required me to take some to go. The spice level was exactly where I requested.  For the lunch I had the Jalapeño curry. This has all the warm comfort of an excellent curry but it has a fantastic accent of jalapeño with it. The flavors are robust balanced and they intrigue throughout the entire meal. Some Thai food is great for the first few bites but then you want a new flavor because it only has one bold flavor that tends to overwhelm. The  dishes at SaBai are all complex enough to keep your taste buds engaged in the eating process for the entire meal. That is a really strange way of putting it but it is the best I can do! By the way my friend had the spicy noodles for her lunch and she loved them.  I will be back and I will try another new dish!',5
'I am kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I found it thanks to a Yelp search. The moment I walked in I felt like I was in downtown Rocky Point. Everyone has pretty much covered the complimentary Chips & Salsa but they cant describe how delicious the Green one was. It was not like anything I have ever had. It has a taste of creamy avocados and was perfect with the Chips but also was perfect on the fried fish I had. I sliced some of the fish and put it in a freshly made flour tortilla and spooned some of the Green sauce on it and was in heaven. I ordered the fried (breaded) Fish & Shrimp. The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater. Dont let the location scare you it is perfectly safe and the place is warm and inviting inside. My only regret is I was to full to eat some of the yummy looking deserts in the case. I am going to make room for them next time if I have to split a plate with someone but in any case I will be back.',5
'happy hour every day 4-7p. 1/2 off apps and all drinks and some select sushi stuff.   similar to geisha go go with the deals but the atmosphere is different. a bit larger brighter and emptier. menu items are similar as well but not exact. when the shades are down the place looks closed but i assure you i dont think theyre closed..  more saaakeeeeeebommbs.',4
'Grabbed lunch with a girlfriend last Saturday on 7/27.  We had both been before but it had been years since we last frequented.  We were there around noon and it was still pretty dead.  We were seated right away and quickly decided to splitsy the Jr Caesar salad and the meatball sub (is it me or can you tell whos a close friend if you can splitsy meals?!)  The JUNIOR salad was enormous and we should have used our better judgement and got the Jr meatball as well...but our roaring stomachs got the better of us.  We each only got through half of our half and left a lot of salad on the plate.  Food was good but not great - caesar is pretty generic and the meatball sub is as good as a meatball sub can be.  3 stars for consistency and large portions and reasonable prices - we got outta there with an $8 tab each.',3
'Im never disappointed. Outstanding pasta selection and the take home is just as good. I could eat it every day.',5
'I love a funky hotel and this is one of them.  Its 1920s Europe meets the Old West.  Yeah the rooms are a tad shabby but clean and neat.  Love the Alfred Bierstadt prints and the Remington style statues gilt frames and as someone said vintage Hollywood feel.  Hey some neat celebs stayed here (Marilyn Spencer Mae West!).  It even has ghosts!!!  The Ghost Bar was closed (damn!) and it looks like theyre trying to find someone to take it over.  Hope they succeed.  Its a cool place.  the pool is lovely and relaxing the maid service is prompt (I had to run back to my room late morning and it was already cleaned) desk staff is very accomodating.  Its a quick walk to the convention center and other places.  Get your coffee at Cartel Coffee Lab (see my rave review) which is only a couple blocks away.  If you dont need luxury try this place.  I had no complaints at all (well I didnt see the ghost but Im actually kind of glad).',4
'This place was AWESOME! Our waiter Alex was the best! The food was great! We had the prime rib. Cooked to perfection! The waitress brought us free shooters.looking forward to next year to sample some of the other selections on the menu.',5
'Went in on Monday night  4/16/2012 around 8pm. Place was nearly empty but it took forever to get our food which was an RnR burger and a pulled pork sandwich. I ordered BBQ sauce on the side in case I didnt care for it but the pork itself was very spicy like it was marinated or cook with very hot peppers. It was kind of off putting.  My sweet potato fries were amazing. Some of the best Ive ever eaten. Crispy and seasoned perfectly.  Boyfriend said burger was ok and his healthy side of berries were yummy. Had a singer for mellow Monday and she was very good but I cant tell if it wants to be a restaurant or hipster bar with some appetizers. Just ok if you want a nice dinner thats not a $50 steak',3
'Went for dinner here on a Tuesday night (recommended close to hotel).  First chair I sat in the springs were completely out (sunk in).  Changed seats and ok.  All entrees come with soup or salad; bread; coffee tea or milk; and a small dollop of ice cream for dessert.  The baked lasagna was good along with the salad although Ive tasted better sauces for the lasagna.  The bread was not as good as say Outback Steakhouse bread either.  Overall though good food and reasonably priced for all you get (you wont leave hungry).',3

'LIVING PARASITE IN OUR FOOD - Manager did not care! - PICS INCLUDED  I signed up to yelp just so I could write this single review about Donovans chop house in Phoenix AZ.  My fiancée and I went out for a night of celebrating.  A $250 meal is not uncommon for us but usually with that type of price tag comes a certain level of service. Not at Donovans Chop house in Phoenix.  It started when my fiancée finished her oysters and noticed that something was in the oyster shell that she just ate from. Is that moving? she said? yes yes it is I replied.  Not only was it moving but it was alive.  Turns out that a pea crab was living inside of the oyster that my fiancée just ate. We looked it up right then and there. According to google pea crabs are parasites that feed off of the oysters food supply. When I showed the server she was stunned. She told me she would shot h chef. I asked her to show the manager too and she said No the chef will know what to do as if I wanted the thing steamed and served with a side of butter.  Our meal came and when I asked about the pea crab neither the expediter nor the bus boy knew about our situation. It was only after I asked the server about what the chef said that the situation was acknowledged at all.  It was actually a full hour after finding the crab before the manager came over to drop off our check.  She never apologized and never once said that they would make changes and actually look for crabs in their oysters. She approached the entire situation with as much care as a short order cook that put mayonnaise on a burger by mistake.  How this disheveled woman got to me the manager of a high end chop house is beyond me. I have seen better managers at Dennys and Cocos bakery. At least there they check in on their customers. When I showed her the pics of the creature on my phone she laughed and said these exact words Well at least you have a fun story to tell. And she is absolutely correct. I tell everyone the story and it goes something like this:  We went to Donovans Chop House in Phoenix and found a living parasite inside one of the oysters we just ate.  The manager waited a full hour before coming to our table and laughed off our experience as a fun story.  After being freaked out by finding a living creature in our food the most she did for us was to knock $12 off of our $250 bill and did the bare minimum to make the situation right.  Great story huh Donovans?  Here are the pics:  http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201321.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201207.jpg http://i1131.photobucket.com/albums/m545/collovamedia/IMG_20120204_201303.jpg    The rest of the food was good but not amazing. The special of the day was a $68 pasta which was the best part of the meal.',1
'I havent been in a QT in years.  Mostly buying Chevron gas and when the desire arises buying stuff in their convenience stores.  They must be doing something right here as the place is packed every time I go by.  Going inside they definitely have a system for hot and cold snacks.  A whole row of coffee urns another for hot dogs and such. Two cash registers each working two lines.  They have taken getting people in and out seriously.  Ill probably stop in again for a snack just to get a better feel of what all is in there.',3
'Location and service was great but the food mostly lacked flavor with the exception of the mini shrimp tosatadas which were amazing!',3
'The Silver Spoon Cafe describes itself as A warm and inviting bistro cafe at the San Carlos Hotel. I think this is a pretty good explanation.   While adventuring in Phoenix some friends and I decided to stop in downtown Phoenix for some lunch. We parked at a parking garage near the Arizona Republic on Van Buren and ventured on from there. Soon we stumbled upon The Silver Spoon Cafe a quaint and affordable lunch spot in The San Carlos Hotel. The cafe itself is pretty small but it also has a outdoor patio which gives the cafe a more secluded and peaceful vibe. The restaurant features a mix of sandwiches salads coffee smoothies wraps pastries desserts and assorted breakfast items. I ordered the San Carlos Classic which includes roasted turkey provolone mayo lettuce and tomato on a french baguette. The sandwich also included a pickle and coleslaw. The sandwich was nice and big and tasty. They even made a grilled cheese for one of my friends which wasnt on the menu. She also had a refreshing Tropical Twister smoothie. If you are in the downtown area for breakfast or lunch you can get a yummy meal with a nice atmosphere for the same price as the Subway across the street!',4
'You get a bang for your buck!  Nothing fancy very basic not a great variety of nail polish quality isnt bad & its cheap :) The secret has gotten out though & this place is very nearly always packed. Still the wait is never too long since they have LOTS of employees.',4
'Outstanding! - I hit Durants again last night for the new dates birthday and Its going to be hard to think of a negative thing to say. Everything from the entrance to the decor and lighting  to the incredible food and wine was perfect. Shrimp cocktail bisque steaks and a great dessert..there is nothing else to say.',5
'Ive shopped at this location maybe 8-10 times. Weve always had mediocre to good service but  the last two times have been unsatisfactory. A few days ago all my sale items would not ring up at the sale price at the register. The cashier said they would ring up automatically but they obviously didnt. She was less than courteous and sat there rolling her eyes and seemed to blame me for their problem. Its not my fault their stuff doesnt work! Upon trying to correct the prices (after her associate walked all over the store to verify I was correct) she rang up an item twice and I had to correct her again. When I left there was no sorry for the trouble no have a nice day or even a nod. Just a blank stare and not a word. I was not impressed.  Today I went to return two of the five items and I was told that I couldnt receive a full refund of WHAT I PAID for the items because I used a frequent shopper $10 reward certificate. They shorted me about $4.  Four bucks isnt a big deal in my life but thats some crappy service if you ask me. I could understand if my purchase was less than $10 but it was for $132.  My wife just told me that last month she used another $10 reward certificate to buy my daughter a pair of shoes.  She ended up having to exchange the new unworn shoes for the identical shoe in a different size.  She was asked to pay $5 to make the exchange! WHAT?!? This is how they treat their loyal customers?  I guess our family wont have to worry about the frequent shopper reward certificates any more because Dicks has turned out to be aptly named as far as Im concerned. Im done with them.',1
'I love Katies and will not go anywhere else to get my nails done.   I have been going there for about 4 years and have no complaints.  Sure when you walk in they might seem a little rude but once you get talking everyone opens up.  They are actually quite funny.  Katie knows that I am a dog groomer and am very hard on my nails.  My nails do not break and on the rare occasion that they do Katie is very prompt to repair it.',5
'Zia rocks~! They always have the CDs Im looking for and if they dont they will gladly order it. They buy my used CDs and do not scrutinize them with a huffy my music taste is so much better than yours attitude. Their rewards program is awesome last time I was there I got $11.00 off my CD purchase. Woot woot! They also have a cool zine that can hip you to all the new music coming out and they list all the bands coming to the valley on their window in front. Nice!',4
'This is the second time I have been here and I didnt write a review the first time because i wasnt that impressed. We wanted to give this place another try because our friends loved it.   I had the Stoner Bowl and was pleasantly surprised. It was absolutely delicious. So a sushi place selling a buffalo chicken lettuce ranch and rice bowl.   Yeah it seemed like something you would eat after a late night of drinking. Very impressed. Huge portion of chicken just a touch of ranch and white rice that goes perfect. I will be back again. Just shows you that you should always give a place a second chance.',4
'DO NOT -- I REPEAT - DO NOT trust these people connected to Litchfields the restaurant on site at the Wigwam. I married my childhood sweetheart on New Years Day in our home. The Wigwam (Litchfields) made us sign a contract to have our wedding dinner there and then decided to close the restaurant for the day (New Years Day) 36 HOURS before my wedding. There is no excuse for this. The very first thing we asked was whether the restaurant would be open for NY Day. The answer was a resounding Yes  next came the contract and this was months in advance. However they had no problem ruining my wedding dinner. They shipped us off to Reds BAR & Grill for the dinner and the ambiance was in the negative category. They assured us it would be great. They did not decorate the table except to plop a poinsettia left over from Christmas in the middle. They used 3 of the 24 roses we bought them to decorate the cake and kept the rest. When we asked for them to be brought out the manager brought the roses in the original plastic wrap and plopped them into a bucket on a side table - - UGH! It was unbelievably disappointing. It is so inappropriate to have a wedding dinner in a golf club bar however we had no choice. No one offered to compensate us in any way. Bad show Wigwam -- you ruined my wedding dinner. PS - Then we stayed there on our wedding night in a boring cold room overlooking the pool - nothing cozy about it. YUCK all over the place. This joint is good for conferences and that is it! Spend your money elsewhere.',1
'I was at this restaurant in their first week and wrote a quick tip about how good the carne asada flatbread was. I did not review the service or anything else at the time because if you go into any restaurant expecting perfect service within their first few weeks of opening you need get off your high horse and come on back to the real world.  My girlfriend and I have been back at least four times since their opening week and you can see that theyve really ironed out the kinks. I think we had so-so service once and great service every time thereafter.   Atmosphere: Somewhat dramatic with a industrial chic feel. Great for dates. I also picture myself doing a bit of Sunday Funday drinking out on their huuuge patio.   Drinks: They have a great selection of beers on tap with a few I havent seen at other places including orange blossom and their own house beer. My girlfriend likes their spicy margarita but is usually drawn to their bubbles i.e. prosecco.   Food: I reiterate THE FLATBREADS ARE AMAZING!! I have had all of them by now and each one has been great theyve even added a shrimp flatbread with grapes that I think beats the carne asada one. A feat I didnt think possible. The PB&J de puerco is so good I am drooling thinking about it slow cooked pork belly slow cooked tomato jam peanut puree on a soft torta-esque bun as Homer Simpson used to say mmmmm...pb&j de puerco (tongue out drooling).    I heard they are going to start doing brunch soon all I have to say is sign me up!',5
'Oh finally a Wendys with some decency!  Ive eaten here at this location on and off for the past few years and today was no different. I was on the way to the Arabian Horse show at Westworld and my stomach was grumblng-loudly  I came in here to have an early lunch before I headed into the event. This place over the years has always been one of my favorite locations because their always consistent.  Food is hot and ready staff is friendly and the dining areas always clean.    Today I went with the combo # 1 and it was out in no time.  Bathrooms were well stocked and clean and the condiments were well stocked. I will say I like this location more then others. Kind of buried in the shopping center but its clean and nice just about every single time I go here.  Oh and their new breakfasts?  AWESOME!',4
'I grew up in Phoenix with the original Cine Capri which was a great place to see a movie - big screen and incredible sound system for the day.  So I was looking forward to seeing a movie at this theatre in the Cine Capri.  The experience was pretty disappointing - the screen wasnt much bigger than most theatres and the place was pretty dirty.',3
'Always passed by this establishment and wanted to try so today I did just that The interior could use some renovations/updates... It is just really worn/dated... The guy who helped take my order was very nice and helpful. I wanted to get one of the sausage subs/sannys but the sausage was not thoughed so I decided on the cheese steak with provolone cheese and fried onions... It was actually pretty good and hot. If I had known about the cheese wiz I might have gotten that maybe next time... I also wanted to add some off the yellow peppers but they looked like they had been sitting all day so I passed them... I tossed some crushed red pepper on though and it was good... All in all... The visit was fine... The interior was really the downside... Food was good and service was good... Oh and prices were pretty okay...',3
'Service was great and my chicken fried steak was so friggin delicious! Cheaper and great quality compared to a restaurant I usually grab from for chicken fried steak. This might be my primary spot to buy chicken fried steak from!',5
'I came here to get take-out. It was broad daylight so I wasnt too bothered by the sketch neighborhood. And I parked next to a Lexus in the hopes that my car would look so crappy in comparison no one would want to take it. I ordered the machaca plate with rice beans and a flour tortilla. After wrapping up only about a quarter of the machaca into my tortilla I instantly regretted not getting another tortilla. I was in tortilla heaven. Soooo tasty! The machaca was awesome as well and I ate the entire meal without hesitation.',4
'Brian and Holly are amazing!! My friend recommended Dessert Sun as she had a fantastic experience as well. Great people with values... Very knowledgable and helpful in providing recommendations for a comfortable and quick recovery. I continue to recommend them and have since moved to California. I recently had an injury and happened to be in AZ. I couldnt wait to get in to them!! They worked around my schedule and are always so helpful. I wish I could bring them back to CA :)',5
'I am here twice a week to drop off work clothes. They are always quick and friendly love the guy thats usually in front. Prices are good and I have never had a problem with their work. Ive had comforters cleaned for $15 not bad and yesterday dropped off two pairs of pants one of which needed the hems on both legs sewn for a grand total of $11.',4
'When you see an almost empty restuarant at 7 pm on a Sarurday night in the busiest retail location in metro Phoenix it should be a hint about something. Unfortunately we forgot about that and chose it anyway.   Very poor food with amateur level service. They can not survive for long this way.',1
'The server for our party of 8 left quite a bitter taste in my mouth Despite her attitude and her general lack of f***s given Id say the food was great. I had pork belly on bed of arugula and a heavenly nut/grain salad that made up for being forced to talk to her scowling face. Why work in the service industry if you insist on making customers feel like they are a massive waste of your time? Lucky for her the people I went with had class and held it together for the special occasion.   Honestly how annoying.   If I did live in Arizona I would not go back.',2
'I discovered this place through LivingSocial vouchers. Usually I admit Im a voucher-hopper... but this place has my business for life. Ive been to all the Fuego Restaurants (Cantina Bistro Cityscape Tacos). They all cater to a bit different crown and have a different vibe and aside from a few staples different menus. This one Fuego Bistro is by far my favorite.  I love this restaurant. Im not a foodie not a snob dont give half a crap about the historic atmosphere and unique setting or vibe. In fact I dont even eat there (I almost always get it to go). BUT MY GOD THE FOOD IS SO DAMN DELICIOUS.  Ive tried a number of their dishes. Im not a fan of spicy (very finicky stomach)... I never cease to be impressed with this place. The food definitely has a unique zing to it very flavorful but still somehow doesnt kill my tummy. Its not overpowering but unique. The flavors and textures really work well too (and Im not one to normally give a hoot about things like textures). Even I know that its VERY well made well-thought-out food.  Kinda small menu but everything is so good. I prefer the dinner menu - it is quite different from the lunch menu. Not cheap not expensive very generous portions. Well worth it. It really is fusion like none other Ive ever tasted - I cant describe it using anything other than INCREDIBLE!  Some of my favorites:  - Empanadas (wow)  - Dinner Menu Chili Relleno (oh my god - it has mahi mahi mini scallops shrimp and other deliciousness). Definitely get the jalapeno creamed corn as one of your sides they are perfect together.  - Steak (get the mashed potatoes as one of your sides)  - Prawns (amazing)  To the people that said their shrimp was probably from Trader Joes their food was bland the service was bad or the experience was just MEH you must be THOSE people the ones who always have to bitch about something. Ive been here at least ten times now and Ive never gotten anything but perfection. It may not look like the Ritz but you definitely wont be disappointed.  Very personable nice staff good and quick service the one time I ate in lightning fast service when I do take out... even when they are packed. What I love - even when I go in there with a LivingSocial voucher they treat me well. EVERY single time whether its dine-in or to-go. Usually when you use a voucher and order to-go the hostesss face reads Im not getting a tip and you get service to match. Not here! Truly impressed. Also Ive noticed elsewhere that to-go portions get stingy compared to if you dined in. Also not here - the to-go portions are still huge!!!  They get busy on weekend evenings (especially during fall/winter - patio season) so make reservations.  My SINGLE gripe: They have limited seating and most of it is patio (very little inside seating small place). Im not a people-person I like my privacy and personal space... I like to tuck away in a corner. This is impossible inside (its a not-very-large rectangle there just isnt an out-of-the-way table)... its kinda possible with some of the courtyard patio seating but I dont really like to eat outside. This is why I get to-go. Oh yeah parking does get a bit skimpy when they get busy... Ive so far always been lucky and gotten a close spot but I can see how some people might complain about it.',5
'Amazing!  What an incredible first time to a place wonderfully run by an old friend!  Peg and I dropped in tonight (early enough so that we could savor the friendship of Bernie and Gina) and had an amazing meal.  Pork belly pastrami appetizer the traditional chopped salad and creative main courses of the scallops/grits and meatloaf/yukon gold potato. Of course the pecan nut bars were an emphatic end to one of the best meals that we have had. It is so  nice to see gracious people excel at what they do and this is one of the best ever.  We will return and bring friends!!   Love you guys!!',5
'While not as good as Fiesta Burrito this place is an okay substitute.',3
'On Feb 7th 2008 I attended the world premiere performance of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.  I loved it!  The cast was extremely talented and diverse (I like it when ladies play male roles).  I found the material to be engrossing dark and sophisticated.  It seemed to be hit or miss with the audience... I saw some people leaving during intermission but I thoroughly enjoyed myself and Ill be recommending it to others.  Along with a handful of other Yelpers I also attended the January 5th performance of The Pajama Game.  Now let me preface this by saying that Im not a big fan of musicals but I did have an ok time.  The cast was a gifted group and bursting with energy!  The set and costumes were colorful and creative and the 7-person orchestra was wonderful!  The story itself is the only thing that didnt thrill me... as to be expected for a musical the plot is just fluff.  Overall I give 5 stars to the skilled group of actors that make up the company.  I cant wait to see more (Ill just steer clear of the musicals)!',5
'I love Justina the owner.  She is super sweet funny and sassy.  Its true that she has a wicked sense of style!  My husband and I had our second date here and religiously go about once a month.  We go for the AWESOME food - the Mint Chicken is my favorite although the Crispy Noodle Cake is pretty good too.  My husband also likes the Pad Thai here.  You cant beat the BYOB or BYOW with no corking fee.  I love the atmosphere the music and how intimate the restaurant is.  This really is one of my favorite places to eat and I always bring out of town guests here.  :)',5
'For a fast food burger place this place rocks! Ive always been an In-N-Out kinda girl (Shhh dont tell them that) but I decided to give this place a try since I kept passing by and wanted to see what the hype was all about. The burgers are delicious the fries are always nice and crispy and their malts are the bomb! If youve never been in the staff is super helpful and offers suggestions for you too. Ive tried the tri-tip burger with sweet potato fries as well- YUM! I can definitely see why this place is called The Habit.',5
'Everytime Im in MAC.. I feel like becoming a trendy trendy like all the MAC girls.. you know like buying some Lady Gaga pop eyeshadow.. and hot pink gloss.. its that cool and fun in there! BUT I dont.. I stick with my muted pinks.. and sometimes grays.. today I went out and got new dramatic mascara.. the MAC girls know their stuff.. no pressure.. they inform.. they let you decide.. well.. I want drama when I go out.. and yes.. I got the pop Lady Gaga looking eyeshadow too.. living large.. uh huh..',5
'I stop here at least 3 times a week.  Inexpensive so great for the budget conscious person but taste like a 4 star meal.  The Pho Broth is perfect every time.  This place is always packed with a mix of people  I just wish the servers were a little bit more friendlier.',4
'great place to go with friends and unwind they have a great patio and being in AZ that is everything (esp. if you smoke)  the menu is diverse the food is New Mexican not mexican (being from Jersey i can not tell you what the difference is only that there is one).  portions are big again catering to groups and making it more of a hang out then a date spot   go green chile!',4
'Dana is an awesome image consultant. She is able to provide helpful tips that are easy to remember when you are shopping even when she is not with you! She offers personalized individual services and also the Fashion Tours for groups as well. She has been a great help!',5
'The Belgian hot chocolate was amazing.  We stocked up on the Christmas gift boxes and asked about their plans for Valentines Day Easter and AZ summers vs. chocolate.  They have it all figured out.  Cant go wrong with Belgian chocolate.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Place was clean and comfortable with a European vibe.  5 stars.  Well be back.',5
'A clear disappointment.  The only reason that I ate here was the free Veterans Day meal.  It was more like an appetizer.  Not only that but for restaurant claiming to support veterans and the military it makes them look bad when they post a no firearms sign on their front door.',2
'Had tire issues in the past few months. I have been to their shop 4 time in the past few months. These guys are an honest tire shop. Great work quality and very reasonable prices. Honest work and they are highly recommended!',5
'Grimaldis makes a great pie sadly they dont make their staff anywhere near as good. First off the hosts were a disaster I came to ask if I could put my name down and received a blank stare. Later on I asked for a perfect Manhattan. The bartender asked me what I wanted it made with SoCo Bourbon Canadian...What? I am thinking to myself. I told him I would have Bourbon followed by instructing him on what the implication of the prefix perfect in my drink meant (thats half sweet and half dry Vermouth). As I was starting to tell him the meaning of perfect he told me he knew what it was. Eventually he made and served my drink on the rocks which I had not specified. My mom and I split a greek salad which was well sized considering it was not the large size. It needed more olives and feta and especially more red onion. My mom and I asked if we could split a pizza without a fee for splitting the pie. The bartender said it would be no problem but when he brought the bill he charged us. I will NOT be going back anytime soon.',2
'I just moved here and the Whataburger is right down the street.  I have been there a few times and I really dig the burgers.  They are much bigger than most fast food chains with a slightly toasty bun.  They seem to be a little tricky to order but I am getting there since I only get them Plain and Dry with Cheese.  I really enjoy the fries they are slightly squishy which is just the way I like them.  They even have ketchup in the little dunking containers.  The only down side is they seem to take quite awhile when you are in the drive through. Havent quite figured that out yet.  Maybe Ill go in and order and see if it takes long.',4
'Took advantage of the Happy Hour deals and glad we did.  Sampled a little of almost every category on the menu.  Fantabulous.   Becca Roll Dragon Roll Unagi Sashimi Calamari Steak Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Green Tiger cocktails.  Delicious. We will be back -hopefully again soon.',5
'definitely wasnt in the mood to have steak until i got here. not too busy on a sunday night. i ordered the filet and shrimp. anything that has bacon wrapped around it is a winner. i heart bacon. my steak was perfectly cooked medium and it was a good size. the shrimp was a bit on the salty side...actually the whole dish was a bit salty for my taste. i got the fully loaded baked potato instead of the mashed and it was delicious. great service. all in all a very solid experience. =)',4
'Without hesitation I would highly recommend Arizona Fire & Water Restoration.  I have had dealings with them for about 18 months now and have always found them responsive competitive  and of the highest integrity.',5
'I just moved here and a friend came to visit. I was looking for a fun place with good food.   Citizen Public House did not disappoint. The staff was friendly accommodating and gave excellent recomendations. The drinks were excellent. The chopped salad was a great start. The short rib was tender and flavorful. I have allergies and when the desert had nuts that we didnt know about the waiter ran off and got me a desert I could have. I cant wait to go back.  My only complaint was that I was so full I could not eat the whole next day.',5
'When the oil change light begins to glow in my car my heart sinks. I detest getting my oil changed.  Youd think its easy to do....after all Im not doing the work. Whats insanely difficult is finding a shop that is reliable reasonably priced timely and doesnt sales pitch you or pressure you for additional repairs when all you wanted was the oil changed.  I got a mass flyer in the mail and to my surprise this shop is so close to home. I made an appt over the phone for the same day. Im not sure of their regular rate but with the coupon I paid about $31 after tax. The guys were friendly and professional and I think I was out of there in about 35-40min.  The oil change service includes an inspection and they explained to me what my car could benefit from/need within the next visit or so. It made sense too given the mileage of my vehicle. I appreciated the information and not being pressured into doing anything that day. I cant stand the typical sales pitch and add ons that shops try to sell you and frequently if I get fed this pitch I dont return.  Ok first time good experience gets a repeat visit from me the next time...which is more than I can say for the last 3 shops I tried! Thanks!',5
'I do like visiting this place after work to wind down. The atmosphere is great the food is pretty darn good but the staff isnt all it is cracked up to be. Dont get me wrong they are nice girls but just a little slow at times... Okay I am being nice. They are pretty slow most of the time but some can carry a pretty good conversation. I do love the popcorn chicken mixed in the teriyaki and buffalo sauce. Mmmm mmm good!',4
'One of my favourite burger places Ive visited and I love me a good burger. The decor is nice and modern. They serve fries and sweet potato fries in a mini shopping cart mixed if you want them. So yummy! The burger was great too. Nothing disappointing about this place. Quite impressive for a burger joint. I guess in America they take their burgers more seriously than in Canada.',4
'Id have to agree with most reviews.  This is a nice little breakfast joint.  I had the Ajo Wrap and a side of AZ Potatoes (home fries) and paid $8.54.  Very reasonable price at a time when a good breakfast in Phoenix can easily add up to $15 per person.  They were both tasty and fresh.  The potatoes had some little pieces of green and red bell pepper mixed in so that added a little extra to the overall flavor.  The wrap had a good bit of chorizo and the eggs tasted fresh.  The atmosphere has a good vibe (other than the one family in there eating among which there existed one or more of them who needed a shower.  I think that was the exception not the rule however.)  Id definitely rate this among the Top 15 breakfasts in town.',4
'I love this location!  I am there every Fri morning for my business meeting. The staff is always friendly and the food is always great!  Thanks!!!',5
'Got takeout.  I liked it.  Woman on the phone taking the order was especially friendly and accommodating of my not having a menu and not really having any idea what I wanted to order.  Orange chicken was especially good and nuanced; pork fried rice was flavorful; oyster sauce beef was particularly delectable.  White rice was well white rice.',4
'Right on time and very efficient.',5
'I tried out Perk solely based on Yelp reviews.  Overall it did not disappoint: they give a 5-star greeting and service is solid the facility is very clean and the food is pretty good.    We got the 2-egg rosemary potatoes and toast for $4.99 and a Mediterranean omelet for $7.99 (?).  The omelet was pretty tasty!  They also claim to use local and organic ingredients!',4
'I stayed away from lululemon for awhile because it seemed so trendy. Well then I started following the fitness trend myself and found out its really fun. Then I found out lulu is so popular because they have awesome clothes and find the best advocates for fitness out there. Not only is the staff at this location in great inspiring shape they are all so friendly! Really! I went to yoga on the lawn which is free and I try to make it to Run Club when I can because I enjoy it. Maybe I dont enjoy the actual running in the heat like most sane people but after Im finished I am so glad I went!  Oh and the clothes are amazing. So cute and good quality.',5
'Yum. Yum. Yum. I just got back from a trip to Hawaii a few weeks ago and have been craving Hawaiian food. I had heard about this place awhile ago so I was hoping could cure my tastebuds island blues. Im not even kidding this place was just as good if not better than some of the places I tried in Honolulu. Mahalo Mai Island Grill you made this mainlanders day.  They are only open for lunch (too bad) and it was packed! I thought maybe because ASU is on winter break it might not be as busy but I was wrong. The place is tiny - only 4 tables inside that barely seat 3 and a couple tables outside.  I had the grilled mahi-mahi. Each order comes with a scoop of rice a scoop of mac salad and some lettuce under the meat. The fish was very tasty not dry at all and the serving was two decent sized pieces. The rice was a tad bit mushy but still good. The mac salad was delish! It had almost a sweetness to it that balanced the saltiness of the rest of the food.  Mai Island also serves Hawaiian Sun drinks which I have not seen anywhere else so you can enjoy guava juice or other tropical juices with your meal.  Someone else had mentioned that they had spam musubi. I didnt see it on the menu so either they dont serve it anymore or its a special off menu item.  I will most definitely be returning to Mai Island Grill. I cant wait to try the Loco Moco! I just wish they were open on weekends!!',5
'I love this place! My favorite venue/bar in the Phoenix metro area.  Things I like: - Owner and waitress: Jason (I think) and Taniesha - provide great service! - Drink prices and quality: perfect!  - Shows: GREAT bands come through here!  Things I dont like: - ...sometimes it feels small when there are popular bands playing. I can live with it.  Yep I will keep coming here! Definitely a cool laid-back place to have a few drinks and see some good shows.',5
'I went to the new location located on Gilbert and Broadway and wasnt thoroughly impressed. A friend and I went to try pupusas for the first time and while the food was quite good the service was definitely sub-par. We each ordered 3 pupusas which are relatively inexpensive and coke in a glass bottle to top it off (always a plus). Anyways my first two pupusas were quite good but they messed up on my chicken pupusa and did not include any chicken (just cheese). After explaining this to the waitress she refused to help me or take back my order. She just explained that there is very little meat in a pupusa and I must have ate it all in the first two bites.   Also the employees speak very broken english so communication can be a struggle unless you are a spanish-speaker.',2
'Went there after work with friends for dinner and happy hour.  The food and drinks were quite good and our waiter was super friendly.   A nice clean little place with a mellow atmosphere.  Ill be back.',4
'So good!  $3 Carafes of Cape Cods.  What a deal and they had a kick.   I had chicken and risotto and my friend had salmon eggs benedict.  Both were delicious.  Ended with Fairytale brownie dessert which was well worth ditching the diet for.  Good stuff.  Check it out!',5
'Food is awesome and atmosphere is great!  Had the staple Mac and Cheese it was creamy and delicious! 1000 island burger is incredible! Will definitely be back again and again!',5
'I avoid Pizzeria Bianco because of its notorious wait list. Small brick building in a historical neighborhood limited indoor and outdoor seating. Parking space is also limited. They really need additional locations. If you drive downtown to Pizzeria Bianco expect delays and some very popular tasty pizza.',3
'Very good food. Stopped for breakfast on a rainy morning on a friends reccomendation. Great food and very friendly service. I would recommend to anyone and cant wait till I am in the area again. Best hash in town.',5
'Love this place.  Good service good (bar) food good prices..  They have lots of TVs and plenty of sports on.  Always keep the local stuff on the big screen.  I have been there for many sporting events but was there last Friday for trivia.  Aside from the CHEATERS that beat us we all had a great time..  Well be back..',4
'Amados is fantastic. I used to work next door to the McClintock location so I ate there almost daily. I was delighted to find out about the Alma School location. I like my food fairly simple and this is it. Taquitos are nothing but beef with cheese and guacamole on top. Breakfast burritos are potato egg cheese and bit of bacon. The hot sauce is great. So if you want something just like Fili Bs only better come to Amados. Oh did I mention that theyre open 24 hrs?',5
'This place sucked. The waitress hit on my husband took 20 minutes to get us water then passed us off to another waiter who claimed she had to leave (she didnt - she was there well after we left). The food was mediocre at best and over-priced. The beer we ordered even came with ice floating on top of it instead of head. We definitely wont be returning here.',1
'While on vacation in Scottsdale we shopped at this Whole Foods location.  We have a Whole Foods at home and this one is light years ahead of the one in our home town.  Weve also been in a number of Whole Foods in different cities in the Western US and this location is near the top of the list for our personal experience.    Great selection of all things --- amazing variety of prepared take out items in the deli an incredible assortment of specialty chocolates wonderful array of meats beautiful fresh produce lots of wine choices across price points terrific cheeses great assortment of other goods and really friendly people.  Add all this to an easy to reach location with lots of parking and its a winner!',5
'The food is here is decent but the portion size for the price just doesnt seem to be a good value. Service always seems to be rushed and the clientele is loud and more on the Scottsdale side even though its located in Arcadia. There are other Italian options that are better in the area such as Italian Restaurant and Guiseppes.',3
'I love the library.  This is my local branch and frequent here often.  Membership is free as long as you are a local resident.  Some of the benefits include computer usage checking out books all the local standard library stuff that you would expect.  What I love about this place is that they are open 7 days a week and late during the week (I think until 8 PM.)  I love going here on Sundays to check my email on the computer etc.  I think you can print here for 20 cents a page or something.  Plus the staff here seems to be efficient and so far has answered all of my questions when asked.',5
'Love this place! Born and raised in AZ and the best Mexican food in the Valley! The beans are delish abc the service is great Margarita are only $1.75 all day everyday   I get the chicken  flautas',4
'My wife and I went there looking for fabric to redo our dinning room chairs with. The employee who first helped us out gave us poor direction on what type of fabric we should be looking for where to find it exactly and seemed reluctant to leave here station as if she was busy working... which she wasnt.  Then once we found what fabric we wanted I got another associate to give us a hand cutting off how much we wanted. She was pissed off because... I dont know... maybe because I asked for assistance and she had to stop what she was doing. Maybe she should think about another job not customer service. The most positive part about the trip here was the second associate that helped us. She told us to go to another store across town where we purchased fabric for our chairs $10 less then we found at Jo-Anns. Thanks Guys!',3
'Take advantage of happy hour to get a good reasonably priced sample of the rolls and other appetizers that RA offers.  They have good drink specials too.  I dropped in for a late dinner last night.  My only complaint was that the music was loud for my tastes  I didnt know they had a dj spin on Sunday nights.  If youre into that by all means its worth the trip.',3
'We really enjoyed Hulas and its wonderful outdoor patio. I wish I could elaborate more but I remember very little of that night!! I do remember it was great and that I really enjoyed the Mai Tais!!!  Service was quick and friendly!!  Lovely place!!',5
'Id call it an undiscovered gem but it seems everyone I know has been urging me to go there for at least a year or two. So maybe Im the only one whos out of it.  Great prices on delicious food for happy hour. Some of the best ceviche Ive had North of the border. Guacamole thats going to jackslap you in the head. Its that good. Margarita is pretty good too. Order the chicarron. Just do it. It comes out looking like a cooling tower at a nuke plant.  Service was swift and pleasant.   About the only drawback is that its almost as noisy as a stamping plant. You know like where they stamp big pieces of metal and stuff. Hard surfaces all around and the music is pretty loud as well.   If you go check out the tribute to the late journalist Don Bolles in the hallway leading past the restrooms. It was on a Summer afternoon in 1976 that a bomb planted in his car in the parking lot of the Clarendon Hotel went off morally wounding him. Its honorable that the management remembers the event and definitely makes the Gallo Blanco a stop on the Mondo Phoenix tour.',4
'A good barbecue spot. The food is usually not fresh as it is served cafeteria style.  However the food is good here and if you get it catered it is actually fresh so I would definitely recommend their catering service.',3
'Without Yelp and GPS youd probably never find this place. Its hidden behind a coffee bar in an industrial office park. They clearly have a strict sign ordinance in Phoenix because there is no visible signage to this place.   The best & biggest pulled pork sandwich Ive ever had is from 2-Pauls in Lafayette Louisiana. Pork on a Fork is a close second. If 2-Pauls is a 10 for flavor PoF is an 8.5. For size 2-Pauls being a 10 PoF is an 11. 2-Pauls PP sandwich is huge...but at PoF I watched the guy plop a load onto the sandwich that would have been the limit at most places and then he proceeded to drop an even bigger load on top of that. This thing was monstrous. I also ordered 2 ribs (for 3 bucks extra). They were about 1/3 the size of 2-Pauls ribs but tasty none the less.  I tried 3 different sauces: sweet & mild hot and crazy js (the guy loading the sandwich said it was his favorite). Well Im glad I took the recommendation because it was the best of the 3 sauces.  Now that Ive eaten all that stuff Im going to have to go to sleep. Ill have to sleep on my back though. Ill pop if I roll over.',5
'This was fun.  Originally we wanted to do the T-bone Steak ride but the cowboy on hand took one look at these city slickers and gracefully convinced us to do the shorter trail rides instead.  I am so glad he did.  Prices were great staff was great.  Overall a fun time.',4
'This was a great dining experience!  I enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  Very nice outdoor seating in a quiet location great food and good service.  Cant wait to go back!',5
'While Id like to give it more stars I just cant for two reasons:  The food was delish but not memorable and its a chain.  Upon entering we noticed the atmosphere was a little mixed.  Meaning the decor is a little cold but the employees were very warm and inviting.  We decided to sit at the bar.  We started out with the Firecracker rolls.  Interesting and not bad.  A little on the bland side.  We split one of the Neapolitan pizzas which was also not bad.  The service was friendly.  This location (16th St.) seems to have quite a few regulars as they were popping in and out throughout our stay.    If we are in the neighborhood we might try it again but there are so many good restaurants in that hood...',3
'Great food cheap prices but it stinks that they are cash only especially when I wanted to get more food than what I had cash on me for. They need to seriously think about getting some sort of credit/debt card machine or even an atm machine inside the sit in area.',3
'This place was pretty interesting. I never thought of japanese and italian being a fusion combo but here it is.   The italian food was different but not worth it. My fiance ordered the TanTan-Men and Gyoza and wow you definitely get what you paid for. So much food and large pot of ramen. The prices are reasonable approx $10 per person maybe a little more if you order drinks and/or dessert.',4
'Went there for happy hour the other day. I really liked the other Modern mexican place down on Mill but this one didnt have the same feel even though the decor was very similar. I had the chips and salsa flight for $3 and the chips were rather tasty and the salsas were pretty good but I could have used some spice. The happy hour beer deal wasnt great $3 domestics $4 mexican beers and craft domestics and $5 for imports. The patio looked nice but gets nailed by the sun in the afternoon and can be hot even with the misting system. Wasnt a fan of the fairly loud lounge electronic music the interior has so many hard surfaces it can get rather loud. I stayed for a beer and chips but walked across the street to Blue Martini for a much more fun setting with better happy hour deals. Service was a bit spotty. I am not sure that I would go back perhaps I will give it another shot when its not summer time.',2
'Driving down University I spotted a new lunch destination Thai Elephant. Always excited for new dining options I went there today with a coworker. The food was good and I learned that Thai Elephant is owned by the same family who runs Thai Basil just down the road. Their menu was quite large and although the lunch specials were decently priced we ventured off an had the Seafood Tofu. It was great the portion was generous and they did not skimp on the seafood - there were mussels octopus shrimp and scallops. The tofu in the dish was awesome fried to perfection and incredibly firm this with crisp sugar snap peas carrots and onions all served in a garlic brown sauce. We both had Thai tea (although I am not sure why I always order this ad Thai resturants I dont like it - way to sweet) and it was a nice balance to the spiciness of the dish. I will definitely be returning to try the other dishes that were jumping out at me on the menu.',4
'Friend invited me for a late lunch here. I had the Mozzarella Local Tomato & Basil sandwich. Sandwich was OK. I thought the Focaccia was a bit on the tough side. Ill have to give this place another try. I do want to purchase their bread to take home. Hope to return soon.',3
'Taliesin West represents perhaps the best tour Ive been on in my life.  Dwayne the guide was animated passionate informative and gave us more than 90 minutes of facts stories and intrigue about FLW and the amazing space the Taliesin West represents.  Based on my experience I could not recommend anything but the 90 minute tour.  If youve driven our there pay the extra few dollars (which supports good work philosophy and learning) and indulge your mind.  They feature several discounts for the 60 and 90 minutes tours including those for seniors and active military.  Be forewarned; a large portion of the tour features the outside elements and on a cold and rainy day it can be a bit of a burden without proper clothes and an umbrella.  Even moving inside can be a challenge due to FLWs insistence on using canvas sheets for the roof.  Kick ass stuff!',5
'This is one of the best things to happen to old town in quite awhile - and a damn fine tribute to the hallowed ground of Pischkes Paradise. Iruna offers some seriously good food a modern euro-lounge atmosphere great cocktails (Try the Ginger Lemonado) and a really comfy patio. The staff are passionate talented and eager to please.',5
'The food leans toward the SouthWest and is located near Old Scottsdale.  The place has a couple of patios as well as couches/easy chairs for seating.  Large curved bar with televisions.  Tons of tequila.The place tends to be busy because of its location however the food is nothing special - burgers wraps tacos etc.  Prices are steep considering what you get.  Service can be spotty depending on time of day.',2
'This restaurant has replaced Saigon as my Vietnamese restaurant of choice in the Chandler area.  Ive had the Pho Tai and Wonton noodle soup and both are legit.  Broth is the key thing I look for in a good pho and Pho Vans is solid.  Theyre relatively generous with the meat and all the veggies for the pho.  Even the interior of the restaurant is pretty nice for a Vietnamese restaurant.  Its a modern look with lcd tvs on the walls and a large aquarium in the middle of the dining area.  My only potential gripe is that for a bowl of pho its on the higher side when it comes to price.  Regardless if it says anything about the establishment I may as well consider myself a regular here now.',4
'Absolutely beatiful hiking area. The Gateway Loop in particular is my favorite. It really takes you away from the noise of civilization and back to nature. Its not too strenuous and definitely dog friendly. On the weekends it does get very packed with walkers and runners alike so be aware of your surroundings.   Something very special about the trail head is the educational nature walk they have installed. There are about fifteen stops along the path with information about the plant life animal life weather ecology and human interaction with and of the Sonoran Desert. Im glad I took the time to check it out because I definitely learned a lot about the desert that I hadnt known before.   Highly recommended way to spend a few hours.',5
'When I first started going to Yucca I was scared by the crowd -- the dive bar attracts a lot of rough locals. However it also attracts a lot of cool music lovin folks so give it a chance. The bartenders are some of the nicest people Ive ever encountered. And I now count the owner Rodney as a friend. The beer is also extremely cheap and the live music kicks ass. I recommend heading out on a Thursday when the bar hosts Rock Karaoke. People are invited to sing along with a backing band (the Valleys Zen Lunatics). Youll hear everyone covering The Doors to The Rolling Stones to The Go Gos. And more often than not this turns into a show of local musicians performing covers. Watch out for Nate Ruess the lead singer of Valley pop-rockers The Format. His Beatles covers are killer.',4
'Theres a lot we like about Rula Bula. Hubby adores the Boxty selections and even gets a little miffed when other Irish places do not serve them. Last time we went we decided to try items we had not had before so we opted to share the Fishermans Platter (with 4 shrimp 2 pieces of fish and 1 scallop and chips) and the Irish Mac & Cheese with Rashers (bacon pieces). The Mac was not as stellar as I hoped but that didnt stop us from finishing the dish. It needed a bit more seasoning I think. The Platter was good but the standout for us both was the chips- 1/4 inch slabs of potato cooked to perfection and sprinkled with salt and pepper. The coleslaw was also the way I like it-crispy and not too sweet. The meal also came with two types of Irish soda bread and a side salad which made a very nice lunch the next day as we were completely stuffed from the dishes we shared. Service was attentive and the prices are fair. Well be back for the boxty for sure.',4
'We have always ordered pizza from doughboys but after today we will Think twice before going back. I always do carry out and today went in to pick up our order and the cashier who took my money was also taking phone orders no big deal right? Well that was until he gave me my change and went and started making pizzas WITHOUT washing his hands. He grabbed two hands full of cheese and put in a cup poured it on the pizza then grabbed sausage and pepperoni and spread all over the same pizza. Then he came back up answered the phone and took another order touching the computer and phone then went back to making pizzas again! The phone rang again and the manager on duty came up answered the phone touched the computer and he too went back to touching food without washing his hands or putting on gloves! I then asked for my $$ back for my 3 pizzas and breadsticks and even after giving me my $$ he still went back to making pizzas without washing his hands. Neither one even cared or said they were sorry! They were very busy but that is no excuse for what I saw tonight! Please take caution when thinking about getting pizza from here!',1
'The ambience was superb! I ordered the Chicken Mole.  It was so salty that I could only take a couple of bites.  My husband ordered the Taquitos which had no flavor.  The service was mediocre.  Probably wont return.',1
'Great selection of all American food. Grinders fried favorites salads ice cream etc!',4
'Good food good drinks decent prices.  ALWAYS packed on Fri and Sat nights.',4
'Great food! Great buffet! There is a vegetarian section in the buffet! All buffets should be this good. And the garlic naan was amazing and hot.',5
'Our Sunday night plans turned out lamer than expected and RAs reverse happy hour saved the evening! All dressed up on a Sunday evening with nowhere special to go? Ra will do!  Sunday nights they transform the bar in to the Flying Fish Lounge. A DJ sets up right around 8pm in the corner of the bar and the beats stay bumping til close. Though the beats are nothing out of this world it just spice up the bar area but doesnt cause too much commotion in the restaurant area...  Drinks & food at RA are overpriced regularly but as mentioned for HH you cant complain. The prices range from $2-$7 for both drinks & sushi specials. Big rolls like the amazing Las Vegas Roll & probably the shrimp tempura are $7 basic rolls like spicy tuna are $4 & I think the nigri is $3.. Hot sake - $1 Big Kirin beers are only like $3 & their mix drinks range but are never that impressive.  That night I ordered two rolls (the toosty maki is always a winner if you like eel sauce) & some yummy Albacore appetizer and my tab was $19. My girlfriend ordered dessert and it looked amazing! An asian spin on the banana split it was served like a tempura sushi roll but instead was fried ice cream smothered in chocolate sauce whipped cream strawberries etc. looked amazing!  Oh Ra you may be a chain but Im glad to have you close.',4
'Last time we were in Wickenberg we decided to bypass some of the usual eateries downtown and found El Ranchero.  It was a pleasant surprise.  I had the beef ham and chicken quesadilla which was yummy.  The salsa and bean dip were excellent.    Definitely a place to visit again.',4
'Im not sure where the address comes from.  This place is on Normal (its in the Memorial Union).  Anyway I come here relatively often when Im on campus and I have to say that I quite enjoy the place.  The food is all relatively fresh there is a broad menu selection and tons of fillings to choose from!  I almost always go for the $5 combo.  Its a regular veggie pita pita chips and a drink.  Fill that sucker up with veggies hummus garbanzo beans peppers and toss on a dressing (maybe a bit of italian) and youve got a tasty health quick and cheap meal.  It beats the hell out of the Taco Bell around the corner on freshness and nutrition.  Taco Bell may win on price but this place wins on value (since youre you know getting food and what not instead of well Taco Bell).  If youre not going the $5 veggie route it loses a bit of its appeal since a lot of the other stuff can get up there in price.  Ive tried other things though and theyve all been good so far.  The meat when I get it is usually very fresh (they grill it right there).  Oh and I know this is weird but I like their packaging.  The pitas are wrapped in a handy two-piece wrapper.  You tear the top 2/3 off and are left with the bottom as a nice handle.  Its very neat and clean especially when you get something liquid in there (like a dressing).  It also makes it easily to walk with it if youre in a real hurry.  All in all not a bad choice on-campus.  Its a good meal at a good price and way healthier than pizza or burgers.  Dont make a trip to the Tempe Campus for it but if you need something while youre already there you cant go wrong at the unfortunately named Extreme Pita.',3
'No more dinner hours! :(',4
'A friend and I ran a 5k last night so we decided to indulge in Portillos for dinner. We made out way over and while it looked busy there wasnt a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm not hot and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though it wasnt a total rip off. On our way out I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.   Maybe they are experiencing a lack of quality control in the kitchen since opening up? Ill probably try the Tempe location once it opens up but I was less than impressed with my first time here.',3
'I went here for the first time today during the lunch hour and holy moly was it good! A friend recommended it so we all went (as a rather large group) to try it out.   Its not a very fancy place but boy does it deliver some great food! And the price is unbeatable; just about everything is under $10. I had Pepes Sample Platter for ~$8 so I could try a little bit of everything. Others got burros enchiladas and I think someone even got a tamale. Not one of us was disappointed.   The service is also extremely fast and very friendly. If youre looking for a place to grab a quick bite to eat south of Old Town skip the fast food burgers and stop by El Molino.',5
'Love this place! Great service and good food. Another great spot in downtown Gilbert.',4
'It sounds like I have had a completely different experience from everyone else but unfortunately my trip started so badly that I couldnt really enjoy it.   When we arrived for our 6:45 reservation we were told that there were two girls at our table for six that had been there three hours and paid about an hour before and they were sure would leave soon. They offered us a table inside but we wanted to wait for our outside table that we had reserved. So 20 minutes later we asked the manager if there was a nice way she could imply the table was reserved or ask them to move to a two-top so we could have our table (this was after the hostess offered that we could stand over them until they moved). The manager told us she would not ask them to move even though they had been holding up the table for three hours and were not eating OR drinking anymore.  A second group of five came in for their reservation at the table outside next to what would have been our table and was told basically the same thing. That there was a group that had been at their table for over 2 hours had paid and they would just have to wait as they wouldnt ask that group to leave or move.  At that point my blood was boiling so much that I couldnt enjoy the food once we were finally seated at a different table outside that the hostess worked out for us. We were then treated like we were the trouble children for wanting a table we had reserved. The girls were still there when we left. So they took up a table for five hours not allowing other people to rotate through (thus costing the restaurant money and the staff tips).  I am sure the food was good but the experience and management was so bad that I cant go back. Its a shame. It sounds like others on this page really liked the place however I have experienced and seen places alerting people that a table is reserved and they  need to move in a nice way and if this restaurant doesnt want my money enough to allow me to eat at my reserved time then they really dont get it. Or stop taking reservations or preferences. That I would understand too. If you cant guarantee inside or out for a large party that is totally ok but dont say You can have a table outside at 6:45 and then make that party wait for a group that is just killing time.',1
'The last two times Ive been to Saddle Ranch its been disappointing. Both times my group and I arrived during dinnertime and asked to be seated inside for dinner. When we arrived the entire restaurant was practically empty and yet both times they told us that the wait was 45 min- an hour due to reserved parties. Yet like I said nobody was there and in the time we were there I never saw one reserved party arrive. While the wait to sit inside was 45 min - an hour coincidentally enough they always have seating available on the patio which is where they seated everyone who were walk-ins. Since we were hungry we ended up sitting out on the patio and the seats inside remained empty for the majority of the time we were there. Do they want people to sit on the patio to make it seem like more people are at Saddle Ranch then really are? Who knows but when its that hot its too to eat outside. I understand that restaurants get crowded but weve now come to Saddle two times and have been told its too full to be seated inside both times and we could either wait an hour leave or sit on the patio in 115 degree weather. Next time I will probably choose another restaurant to visit when its time to pause the Saturday activities and have a bite to eat in a lively setting. Instead Ill keep this place on my list when I need a spot for a rowdy night out and I dont need sit-down service.',2
'Seeing an absolutely packed restaurant at noon on a Sunday is definitely a good sign that the food will be well worth the wait. People line up around the restaurant to order/pay at the counter and then scour the place to find an empty table (or patiently wait until someone leaves to get a free spot). The menu is decently-sized with lots of great breakfast and lunch options. The bar is small but features the classic breakfast boozey items as well as traditional cocktails.   I ordered the farmers sandwich which is a fried egg on ciabatta bread ham red onions and cheese (with an ordered addition of avocado) served alongside some greens and cherry tomatoes. For $7 I thought the sandwich was decently sized (was only able to finish half of it) and pretty generous in the portion of ham and veggies. The sandwich was definitely tasty no foodgasm here but a good start to my morning. The caramel latte was creamy but overly sweet and their regular coffee was a tad watery. I do appreciate the free coffee/tea refills and the oranges/lemon wedges for the water. That was a huge plus for any coffee drinker that needs at least a couple of rounds to fully wake up.  Overall a good breakfast spot on Mill for people of any age. The crowd is very mixed- from the walk-of-shamers to the after-church goers and everything in between. Its a pain in the ass that you cant order at your table but they seem to be pretty successful in their current system so props to them',3
'Did a Chicago Bears fan really drive all the way out from Desert Ridge to Chandler to join some friends for happy hour trivia at a Packers bar?  Yes I did.  And even though I was not a fan of the green and yellow decor I still managed to enjoy a fun Friday night at Stadium Club.  The happy hour is pretty good.  For about $10 (including tip) I had a giant glass of Fat Tire and an order of sliders.  The sliders were really good.  Not too greasy and well complimented on a toasted brioche bun.  No complaints.  Except for all the Packers decor.',4
'I recently spent the better part of a week at the W Hotel in Scottsdale.  Of course I picked the coldest few days seen in recent years in Phoenix!  Very happy to find that the hotel restaurant was Sushi Roku!  Id been there once before in LA.  Some highlights....  -- very creative out of the box options -- extremely knowledgable wait team -- impeccable service   A few of my favorites that our group enjoyed....  1.  Black Truffle Tempura Handroll  2. Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus 3.  The triple desert sampler (chocolate lava cake was awesome!  While it wasnt cheap -- it was well worth the cost.  I knew it was pricey when I walked in but the amazing menu outstanding wait staff and quality make you forget about the price!',5
'Chiropractors office attached to the Golds Gym at 83rd and Thunderbird. We went here after a subpar experience somewhere else and were definitely impressed. Dr Stamp works m/w/f and always has a few minutes to chat or offer advice between seeing patients or while doing paperwork. He was the first chiro Ive been to who actually asked me where I hurt THEN did adjustments specifically to fix that. I had ribs out of whack and a few other things and he put them all back. And he was comfortable working on my above-average sized husband which some chiropractors arent. I would have liked to be shown more stretches and such to do so I wont be back as often. They are great at working with your insurance and finances- they have a deal where for $199 you can go as many times as you want in a month. You do have to sign up for 2 months back to back but it is still a good deal. Only downfall here is that their cash rate is higher if you dont have insurance. It is $50 cash for an adjustment but only $35 if you have insurance. Thats true whether or not you even opt to have them bill your insurance. I think they take walk-ins but if nothing else we have been able to call and get same-day appointments pretty consistently.',4
'Imagine every hipster Pinterest-inspired wedding youve ever seen. Then mix all that into an overblown cliche. The Duce would be the result.  Mason jars everywhere. Park benches as tables. Barnyard and rustic chic. And they ask for your crazy nickname when you order. I was waiting to find the photo booth.  Overhyped if you ask me. I can see why Guy Fieri would recommend it.  Mega overpriced menu with very limited options. The kitchen is an airstream trailer.  Also its half gym...? Weird.',2
'Ive only ever sat outside at The Grapevine so Im not reviewing the apparently dark divey inside bar.    We had a great time.  I never had Lavosh before I tried it at The Grapevine and my eyes have been opened! (Its amazing - if youve never had it its basically cracker-pizza except fancier.)    If it werent such a drive to Scottsdale I think wed come here more often.',3
'5-Stars for the best Soul Food in the Valley!  Im from the Deep South (Mississippi) and Ive been craving soul food for years so when a group of friends suggested we eat at Lo Los yesterday I couldnt say no!  The Lo Los in Scottsdale is a nice open restaurant that was VERY crowded at 2PM on Saturday afternoon.  Every group had a wait of at least 20 minutes.    I had the special which included two pieces of fried chicken - a breast and a wing - a waffle with syrup and I ordered a side of cheese grits.  First the waffle.  No one at waffles with fried chicken in Mississippi.  I think this soul food extension is an invention of Chicago though I may be wrong.  The waffle was tasty but nothing spectacular.  It was aight.  The chicken though was by far the best damned fried chicken Ive had since I ate at a family-owned Cajun fried chicken place in Gonzales Louisiana 15 years ago.  It was THAT good.  Generous pieces.  Fried to perfection.  The grits: these were REAL grits.  Not instant.  The good stuff.  The kind that takes a good while to cook.  It was perfect.  Man I havent had honest good grits in more than 15 years.  Well be going back to Lo Los just because of grits if nothing else (though I really want more chicken).  Everyones drinks came in gigantic glass mayonnaise jars.  Not too many of us needed refills.  A friend ordered fruit punch kool-aid (which they have ON TAP).  I could SMELL his kool aid from across the table.  He sad it was so strong he probably went home with diabetes.  :D  They dont fool around with their kool-aid.  Service was fantastic.  Our waiter had an awesome shirt that said Scottsdale but Hood forever  lol  Well be going back as soon as we recover.  :D',5
'Great lunch prices and specials!!! My friends loved their chicken shawarmas.  For me the falafel was just ok the pita itself was soft and delicious; decent enough to go back.',3
'Where do people who dont know how to park within the lines go? This place! LOL!   But no worries dont think about it when youre looking for a space that would fit more than a bike. Youll have plenty of time to think about how those people managed to obtain a Drivers License while you stand in the long stagnant line OUTSIDE. Yes you read this correctly! Due to the large amount of people who frequent this particular office & the tiny size of the building itself the line starts outside. Dont forget your deodorant water & walking shoes people! There is a tarp that covers the area where the line forms. As I stood there I saw little lights dancing on my skin and the floor & I thought how cute they drew designs on the tarp uhhh no. There are tiny holes all over it from wear & tear lol. I also observed the large number of people who feel its necessary to bring an entourage.... really?! I understand needing moral support or witnesses from time to time but PLEASE this is not that place! Unless youre accompanying a senior citizen or minor of course :)   Once you get inside you stand in another line to get a #. Then you either sit in one of the retro looking and feeling seats OR you stand in any tiny space available waiting to be called up if all the chairs are taken.   The people who work there are very appropriate (not friendly but professional) & seem to do their job as quickly as they can.   This place is too small and understaffed for the amount of traffic that goes through there. Someone said that after 2:45 the crowd thins out but I dont know if its really true lol.   It would have given it only 1 star but they get an extra star because the employees were polite.',2
'Our favorite theater! Always go for the premium seats. So comfy with a blanket and pillow. Free popcorn and waiter service. Love it!',5
'The reason they are so expensive is because this location is a franchise. Its always been on the high side in terms of prices. Food is kind of on the average ground and while convenient for a location they should realize their high prices wont help them whatsoever. Havent gone to this location in years but Im not surprised they havent lowered their prices.',2
'Its a cool concept conveyor belt sushi but the service isnt as good as the sushi and the sushi is only mediocre at best. Its always crowded when I go but they only seat people at the bar are where the conveyor belt is. Granted thats what most people are there for but it seems there is a conveyor belt(s?) that go around the majority of the restaurant but only the one around the bar is ever in use. Last time I was there  someone in another party had to ask for a booth to be bussed after it sat there for 20 minutes untouched my name got skipped on the list so 4 people that came in after us got seated before us. I said something to two different servers and was told oh sorry I dont know how you were skipped youll be next before we actually got seated. The first time I went I had a similar experience but thought it would be a fun place to take a friend. This second time proved that its not worth going out of my way for',2
'I went to get a prescription filled there and I was told they did not have the item in stock but could order it and have it the next day.  I accepted as it was not something I needed immediately and a day sounded acceptable ( I dropped it off on Monday) As of Wednesday no word of my prescription so I go in to inquire about it.  The first guy I asks looks clueless and gets the pharmacist.  He says they no longer make the item I need and that they have sent a request to my Drs office.  I call my Drs office that evening leave a message for the Dr and she calls on Friday and speaks directly to a pharmacist as to what to change it to.  As of Monday still no word on my prescription.  I call and ask what the problem is and they say my Dr has not called yet so I call the Dr and leave another  message.  She calls me back the next day lets me know that she spoke with them on Friday and that they just did not order it.  Finally on Tuesday  which is 8 days after I dropped my prescription off I get a call saying they ordered my item and I could pick it up the next day.   I am quite positive that they never sent a request to my Drs office and I am certain that they yet again dropped the ball when she told them what to substitute.  My Drs office is always competent and very efficient and I get the feeling that this particular Walgreens is most certainly not.  They did not keep me informed on what was happening and I shouldnt have had to keep wasting my time trying to figure out why they werent filling my prescription and I also feel that they shouldnt be wasting my physicians time having to call them multiple times.  I got a feeling that they just really dont care about their customers.  They were not apologetic and I just got the feeling that not one person there cared at all.',1
'I just got my  brand new Tundra tinted and have nothing but good marks for Manny and Masters of Tint. My truck looks great and the services was fast and friendly. The shop is clean and quality of work is excellent. I never write reviews but those guys deserve it!',5
'This place is truly a compound with multiple buildings of hotel room suites 6 pools a few restaurants and an entire waterpark.  It takes a lot of walking to get around but if you can find your way back to the main lobby they will shuttle or golf cart you wherever youd like to go.  The staff is friendly  and they have big baskets of lollipops in the lobby which was cute.  My suite was bigger than some apartments Ive lived in for years.  It was clean quiet and nicely appointed.  It did smell of smoke but didnt keep me from sleeping soundly or enjoying my time there.  My work pals tell me that local families stay here sometimes just to use the waterpark.  Sounds like fun to me!',4
'Ive been ordering Chinese delivery from a different local restaurant for a while now. No need to name names. I ordered tonight from Bamboo China and it was very good. The pot stickers are as good as you will find anywhere. Everything arrived well packaged and hot. I had the General Taos chicken. It was very tasty and not too sweet. I also had the Ma Pao Tofu in garlic sauce. Very nice. The hot and sour soup could use a little more sour and a shrimp or two wouldnt hurt. That said the black pepper level is perfect. Loved it. Will definitely be ordering again.',5
'The odor wafting from the restaurant coupled with line that literally wraps around the building would lead one to believe they were in for a real treat. They would be wrong. Ive tried Joes twice and simply dont see what all the fuss is about. The barbecue is good but nothing to write home to mom about. The sides are disappointing loaded with fat and lack much in the way of taste. Their standard barbecue sauce has no kick although I did discover that they have a pot of habanero sauce on the condiments table during my last visit. In addition this is cafeteria style dining. That line I mention really does spill out into the street on Friday and Saturday nights and then snacks right through the middle of the restaurant. It is certainly an interesting dining experience.  On the plus side the owner is great - very much dedicated to our town and is certainly hitting the sweet spot of many a Gilbertonian. Ill give it one more try.',3
'The Olive and Ivy... yum!  Just before I came to eat dinner here I happen to be Yelping and Jessica F. quick tipped trying the sangria.  I was late meeting my party of 6 so as I sat down and the waiter took my order I knew I already wanted the sangria - red.  It reminded me of a Framboise I tried at Carlys Bistro very tasty and fruity I had two.  The décor was amazing!  The window coverings were plush and the light fixtures were industrial.  There wasnt uniformity to it but it all came together so well.    Upon recommendation from one of the attorneys I was dinning with I ordered the braised short rib with mascarpone polenta & baby vegetables.  Before the meal arrived the server gave us steak knives but they were useless.  The meat melted like butter and tasted even better.  I had never had polenta before but when I tried it I realized it was basically grits.  I dont particularly care for the texture but I couldnt stop eating them.  And the vegetables were two baby onions and two baby celery meh they didnt add anything to the meal.  For dessert I tried the blueberry gelato and it was typical gelato a great way to end a meal.  Another one of the attorneys had ordered the stuffed ricotta balls and they reminded me of the doughnut holes from Dunkin Donuts.  All in all it was a fabulous meal and great company makes the dining experience that much better.  As for the service I wasnt impressed.  Our server had all of the decorum of someone who worked in fine dining but we rarely saw him.  The dinner lasted two and a half hours and that was mostly because we had to wait so long - wait for drinks to have our order taken to get our meal to order coffee and then dessert waiting for the check.  Then when we did receive our meals three people had ordered the same meal but one ordered it with pureed potatoes instead of the polenta.  When the server didnt know which was which he asked them to take a bite and then he switched their plates!  They of course insisted their $26 meals were taken back to the kitchen and corrected.  I wanted to give four stars based on the food but the service lead me to knock off a star.',3
'Simply brilliant.  I didnt think I frequent this place that much but the waitresses know my drink and order which is outstanding customer service.  The food and atmosphere is what I expect of a eating establishment.  Cant wait for the new place.',5
'I love tapas. I love their tapas.  However each time I go here I end up dropping hundreds of dollars.... sigh.  So I actually havent been in awhile.  I guess the tiny portions just make me want to order EVERYTHING :)  I love the corn dogs.  Yum.  Corn dogs.',4
'I have never been disappointed at Therapeutic Retreat. Even their front desk gentleman is super friendly and getting an appointment is easy.  Each therapist is very passionate about what he/she does but my favorite therapist has been Esta! I probably needed more energy work than I did the actual massage and she gave me exactly that! She incorporated warm washcloths neck wraps and essential oils into the full body massage. I entered extremely anxious and tense and left feeling calm and relaxed.   After each massage they also offer water with your choice of essential oils inside.',5
'I love this place! The pizza is so good and it never disappoints. I went to school down in Tucson and they just opened one near Arizona stadium I screamed when I saw the sign for the one in Tucson I was so excited. Now I can have it whenever I want in Phoenix and Tucson!   The sauce is great so is the cheese and I always get pepperoni which is awesome as well!  I also really like the croutons in the Caesar salad!',5
'This place looked very promising from the menu and the decor.  I typically enjoy any Fox restaurant however this restaurant is a gimmick.    I ordered the free range half chicken.  I really enjoy this dish at most restaurants but I was disappointed.  The chicken seemed to be low quality and was very fatty.  The iced tea was good though.  If you are vegan or have a food allergy this restaurant will be great for you.  However otherwise you are paying for food that may have a gluten-free vegetarian or vegan label that lacks flavor.  If you are looking for this option then try it but otherwise I would find a restaurant that offers a smaller selection of these dishes at a lower price.      Just mediocre.  And way overpriced.',2
'THIS PLACE IS ALL HYPE. I have eaten here a few times. The lines are long and the crowd totally pretentious and obnoxious!! Most come in in there workout gear and have not eveb broke a sweat. The rest are a bunch of snotty tool bags. The food. Mediocre at best. The commuter was tasteless no wait it tasted greasy!! It was disgusting. The egg white omelet was flavorless crap! The croq. was a joke! I can melt ham and cheese on bread with an egg and it would taste less greasy and have 10 times the flavor not to mention be a lot cheaper than this garbage. I have had lunch here too and the sandwiches are something I can make at home. Ive tried to like this place. It seems cute it seems like they put out good food due the massive crowds but to be honest its a joke. I am from California and this is just a hyped up place that people with no taste for food love and flock too. I have had way way better food at places with plates not more expensive than $4.00. These people are making money of folks with no pallet! I e-mailed LGO to let them know my last meal there and service was awful and that I would never return due to the crappy food. I never recieved an answer to this day. Its been 6 months. I am sure they could careless as they are just laughing at all you numb tongued folk returning day after day for their bad food and to be seen while flaunting your new workout gear! Trust me this place is a joke. I will never return. Never! I rather make my own breakfast or lunch than spend a dime on tasteless food. The pizza sucks too BTW!!!!!!',2
'Went there on a friends recommendation.   They look beautiful and the Salted Caramel sample was yummy.  Cant wait to try the ones we bought.',4
'Being from Iowa I mourned the loss of Pancheros when I moved out here.  I was SO EXCITED when someone finally franchised it out here in PHX but I have to agree with a lot of others that the vibe of this location doesnt live up to the ones I visited back home.  People like to compare Ps to Chipotle but I have to scream its not even close!!!! when I hear that.  Pancheros fresh presses and cooks their tortillas in front of you so you dont get some flour-y mess that sat on a truck for days waiting to be delivered then sits in a warmer until you order.  They also give your burrito a nice mixing that way you dont get a bite of pico a bite of rice a bite of chicken and a mouthful of sour cream when you eat your burrito.  The reason I dont give this place 5 stars is the staff.  Sometimes I go and the staff is friendly and attentive.  Other times I go and the staff ignores me to play around and I feel awkward because I am not part of the inside joke.  Other times the staff is just plain incompetent like the girl who burned my Quesadilla twice and another staff member had to step in to complete my order.  All in All I give the place a 5 for food 5 for value and a 1 for customer service/staff.',3
'Joe the owner at Pacific Blue Pools is honest fair priced and reliable. He does my weekly maintenance on my pool. I have had a couple of problems with my pool filter and all I needed to do is make a phone call to Joe and he comes over or instructs me on how to fix my problems. I would definitely recommend Pacific Blue Pools to anyone.',5
'Today I had a small Blue Cheese Salad and cup of Autumn Squash soup. Both were pretty good.   The service for the most part left something to be desired however. Like maybe some acknowledgment? My boyfriend told me I needed to order my salad straight from the salad-making girl with the little hat who was standing there messing with the ingredients trying to look busy. I was standing directly in front of her waiting for her to look up at me. She didnt. Still standing there with my empty tray I asked my boyfriend Are you sure this is where I order a salad?. She still wouldnt look up. Sigh... fine! Um excuse me is this where I order a salad? Seriously that pisses me off that I have to ask. She also looked like she REALLY hated making my salad. Maybe she would rather work in the back or something...  The soup girl was extremely friendly and complimented my shirt and the b/fs Halloween costume. I liked her.',3
'Glad I still have a little piece of San Diego here in Phoenix. One of my favorite places to grab a animal style burger and well fries.   Love the simplicity of the menu and the spread is better than anything else you can put on a burger. The spread is great with fries too!',5
'Went to meet my mom for lunch last Friday with my little guy.  Instead of being greeted by the host staff Carol walked up to me and announced that my stroller wont fit in the restaurant and that she would have to take it in the back.  What?  Ok...  This Britax B-Ready apparently warranted a scolding.  Carol was so incredibly rude and my stroller would have easily fit at a table- minus a chair.  What exactly is their procedure for wheelchairs or other special needs devices?  Do they simply not fit or are they not pleasing enough to the eye to accommodate?  They might want to come up with a better story and take a more discerning eye to the host staff.  Ive always had such great experiences here in the past; what a disappointment.  Well be over at Chelseas.  Theyre cool with my wheels.',2
'Definitely the best Italian market in Phoenix! They have anything youd want from italian themed non-food items to an amazing selection of pastas sauces meats cheeses pastries and breads.  I was craving some good italian food and this place did not dissapoint.  Amazing selection and very nice people.',5
'Had to check out the place because of the reviews! It didnt WOW me like I was expecting but they did gain a customer for sure!! The bagels were fresh and you had a multitude of choices.  A must try! Will be going back to try their lunch options! Side note... The Owner and Staff were very nice and attentive!',4
'The first time you go to Palatte you will notice that they do things a little differently.  The owners of this french style breakfast/brunch/lunch/whatever place have made a serious effort to create a unique and very relaxed dining experience.  And for the most part they have succeeded.  However some diners may find some of Palattes quirks to be frustrating rather than accepting them for what they really are: the small price one must pay from time to time for some really amazing food.   Sure standing in line for 10-15 minutes to order at the register is a little weird- I mean they have waiters why cant they take my order?  And who do I tip?  The girl at the register or the dude bringing out my food?  The whole ordering process is so overwhelming! Not to worry.  Any concerns you have over the business side of going to Palatte will be laid to rest the moment their delicious food hits your lips.  Im a fan of the bev- I get it every time.  Scrambled eggs with avocado and tomato with a side of fresh fruit and toast has never tasted so perfect.  Also the Lemonade which is infused with rose water is in itself worth the trip to palatte.   So even though a breakfast at Palatte may seem like a bit of a craps-shoot once they iron out some of the wrinkles the owners of Palatte will have themselves a 5-star breakfast spot for sure.  In the meantime go and enjoy the food- in spite of the quirks it is more than worth the trip.  On a side note Ive noticed that Palattes odd spelling can make the restaurant difficult to find on the web.  Ill save you the trouble of looking here is a link to their website:  http://www.downtownbrunch.com/  Palatte is open Tuesday-Sunday from 7am til 3pm.    Enjoy.',4
'Sylvia what happened? We normally do take out from the Indian school location but we wanted a sit down dinner so here we are.  First $6 for a kids meal and the burrito was smaller than a dollar bill no fries or rice on the side??I ended up giving my son half my plate because he was still visibly hungry.  Second store bought taco shells? Really? I thought better of you than that. Indian school has homemade shells (or used to). These came straight out of the Ortega box. Terrible.  And finally service. Our server tried really hard Ill give her that but when I ask for new silverware dont point out that you already gave me some. Clearly you missed the part where Im sitting with four kids who likely dropped their fork on the floor. And yeah uhh when a family asks for extra napkins please bring more than two.  The red Chile was still good so that is why its a two star review instead of one.  So completely blown away by the store bought taco shells.',2
'I started working right across the street from this Starbucks a couple weeks ago and its been dangerous to my finances but great for my Skinny Caramel Macchiato fix!  Almost all of the baristas Ive come across have been friendly there was just one guy who seemed kind of bored but he wasnt rude or anything.  My drinks are always made quickly and correctly.',4
'Amazing Bar and Vietnamese Pho! Love that your first visit you can get 50% off your first alcoholic drink too! I have been quiet often for lunch but have yet to try to weekends when it is open till 2am. I plan on trying it in the near future to how well their service and bartenders are. P.S PHO here is delicious and their egg rolls.',5
'Came here recently with the wife for a 3 day stay.  My wife was in town for business so I spent the majority of my days at the pool.  Our room was modern mad men chic style with cool stand alone bath tub and glass door shower.  The only thing I didnt like about the room is that the bed has a 5 inch thick comforter blanket on it and thats it.  So basically you had to sleep with this sub arctic approved comforter over you causing sweating and discomfort within 10 minutes or nothing at all because there was no sheet under it.  I called the front desk and they informed me that this was the style of the bed.  So let me get this straight your hotel lies in one of the hottest climates in the country and you basically force your guests to sleep with a comforter that would keep my grandma warm in an Alaskan igloo?  How about you provide a bed sheet so i can put it over me and sleep like a normal human being?  I digress.  I had breakfast a few times at the Zuzu cafe near the lobby the food was awesome and the service was great.  The pool area was nice and quiet because we were there mid-week the pool servers were friendly and not overbearing like at some hotels.  Had to bring my ipod though because they basically play the same top 40 songs on a loop all day.  I understand music is subjective but at least vary the songs so your guests dont have to hear the exact same songs played every day.  Overall a great experience though and I would definitely come back here next time were in the area.',4
'I recently made a considerable purchase from SB&C which was entirely disappointing.  I ordered bullion and ended up getting proof coins.  Now buying proof coins is not all that bad but why would I purchase from a middle man rather than from the mint?  The mint currently sells 1oz gold eagle proof coins for $1850 SB&C because they are buying on the secondary market sold that coin to me for $2400.  I asked to have the order reversed and get the bullion but they said no. Surprising since they told me they had 3 vaults full of this stuff.  If you are buying gold coins as a collector go to www.usmint.gov and there you can order all you want.  Dont believe it if someone tells you the coins are not available.  I have been buying gold and silver proofs for years.  I dont care how nice you think these guys are or even if you attend the same church they took advantage of me on this purchase - my loss = approximately $7000!  How long do you think it will take to get that back?',1
'Maybe it was because I was starving... I liked the food.  We were at the Pointe for a trade show and this is where we ended up for lunch.  We had no wait and the food was really good I got a shredded beef cheese crisp and my coworker got the chimi plate.  The chips and salsa were good.  Only issue I had was my empty ice tea glass I finally had to ask for more when our bill was delivered.',4
'Had my birthday dinner here as Im a big steak fan.  My girl is a vegetarian so even though this is for my birthday it sure is helpful to have some palatable options for her.  Ill make this review shorter than normal because nothing more need be said.  The food was excellent the service was excellent they even had tasty options for the veggie.  In addition everyone has a crazy friend.  Well one of mine showed up and made an idiot out of herself and the staff handled it excellently (next year we wont tell her where were going though).  Highly recommended.',5
'Food is a plenty here!!!!!  Cant beat the prices either....',5
'I really have to give it up to Jerry and his great service. This gentlemen knows what hes talking about and i would use his services again. Brought my 2005 Mini  for some  major work and he fixed it right the first time. God Bless this guy!',5
'Amazing customer service and the Italian dip was heaven to my taste buds. Ordered the Italian dip absolutely delicious.',5
'I spent my morning at Echo Coffee doing some work and conducting some interviews... I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the staff was when I walked in (even though Steve the owner gave me shit about how I ordered my coffee drink).  Thank goodness he warned me that a large americano at Echo comes with four (yes four) shots of espresso.  I am good with two!  It turned out great and energized me for hours... and no sweetener necessary.  I noticed that in addition to the pastries in the case there is an entire menu dedicated to sandwiches and salads and everything can be special ordered since there is a chef on premises.  I also met the biscotti maker when I was there.  How impressive that there is an entire team behind Echo right?!  There is free Wi-Fi and outlets scattered around plenty of seating and clean restrooms to boot.  This may just become my new go-to coffee shop!  See you soon Echo!',4
'Nook was pretty awesome. Im excited that its in my neighborhood and cant wait to return to try more!  My husband and I came here for dinner last night because we wanted to try the new neighborhood restaurant and had heard good things. When we arrived all of the tables were full so we had a drink at the bar until one became available. The bartender was very helpful with my wine selection and offered a taste before I committed to my order. Their bar stools are super comfortable (they were more like padded chairs on stilts) so much that we almost just stayed there to eat our dinner but decided to wait for a table instead. I can see myself in the future hanging out here just for drinks and watching the pizzas being made at the end of the bar as the ambiance is very relaxing and they were playing awesome music.   We were seated at one of the spacious rounded booths which was also very comfortable. Our server Kaylita was awesome very nice and totally on point throughout our dinner. For food we decided on the deconstructed Asian salad with Salmon cooked medium and the florentine pizza. The salad came out first the salmon was cooked perfectly and was seasoned very well the Asian veggies were crunchy and fresh and the ginger rice was very good with subtle flavor. Our pizza was very good too the ricotta was very and creamy you could tell they used quality ingredients the roasted tomatoes were marinated and not mushy and the crusty was perfect. My only complaint was that the pizza was a little too oily.   After my great experience I will definitely be adding Nook into my neighborhood rotation whether its for happy hour at the bar or for dinner.',4
'I was already a patient of Dr. Eckle when I suffered a miscarriage. He is fabulous. When I got in to see him he took my concerns very seriously and sat with me and my husband in his office to go over possible reasons and preventions. He immediately wrote me a prescription for Progesterone and said when I finally get pregnant to call him immediately. He always takes his time when discussing my health and I appreciate it more than words can say. His nurses are wonderful too. He is a great doctor and someone I highly recommend.',5
'Very very impressed for being on the airport ...',5
'Great food!   Best Thai food I have found on the west side.   My wife and I picked up food for us and friends that just had a baby. We got a bunch of appetizers and main courses to try all were great.   Cant wait to go back.',4
'I would go here again in a heart beat.  The food is great the staff is attentive and very helpful for newbies.',5
'Aside from the smattering of successful chain restaurants this shopping center is a wasteland of empty storefronts and broken dreams.   There are now more empty stores than there are those still in business. The ones to either leave or go out of business were primarily independently owned small boutiques. The ones left standing are your typical mall stores: Charming Charlies Bath and Body Works Victorias Secret (that bitch still wont tell me what it is).   For eats youre looking at Pita Jungle Sauce Buffalo Wild Wings some other pita place  and a couple others in the Outter reaches of the complex.   One shining beacon of privately owned small business is Elevate coffee shop.  They have great coffee baked goods and provide support for their community.  These giant shopping centers seem to be the way of the past not the future and certainly not the current. There is no was to support themselves if businesses cannot survive and customers do not spend money. Now what will it be?',3
'Okay so I love this place. I live around the corner so I am there at least once a week and I think they know me by name which is slightly embarrassing.  They have taken a quiet strip mall space and turned it into an amazing gastropub type restaurant. The ingredients are fresh in season and local they put tons of thought into the menu the beer list is extensive and the old fashioneds make me feel like don draper in mad men.  Try the nancy and the cheese plate is a must. Also attend happy hour here for great deals I think its from 4-6.',5
'Okay I have found my new favorite home office!  I dont have an office for my agency yet so coffee shops tend to be where I get most of my work done.  Last week I checked out Echo Coffee for a client meeting and we both really liked it.  Today I returned and spent a few hours working at Echo Coffee on their wi-fi. It was such a nice break from my usual home office at Starbucks.  Walking into Echo Coffee you can instantly tell its a different type of coffee experience.  The environment is very relaxing music is not blasting so customers dont have to scream over each other and they have great big couches in the back.  Of course atmosphere and great coffee needs to be in balance and it definitely was at Echo.  The coffee is really good and love very fair price for the quality you get (my 2 favs are Cappuccino at $2.75 and $3.75 for large Chai Latte).  My chai latte came in a big ceramic mug.  I dont know about you but there is just something special enjoying coffee out of big mugs and not recyclable paper cups.  A surprising first for me is getting actual lunch at a coffee place and was pleasantly surprised to find the food was also really good.  Can you tell I am a fan yet?  I ordered a Curry Chicken sandwich and it was huge and delicious so finished the whole thing.  There was a nice bonus on the plate - Mango Chutney so make sure you get that if you order lunch at Echo.  I would have loved just a bowl of that and bread as its flavor was so good.  I need to find out where they get this from as I want to have it at home. About $12.50 for my huge Chai tea and curry chicken sandwich.',5
'Phoenix suffers from a lack of great thai restaurants. Yuphas is good not great.  My favorites though I only ate here twice are the crab puffs and yellow curry chicken. I pass on their thai iced teas too sweet for my taste.   In all honesty Id probably like Yuphas better except for the fact my husband considers it quite average. Hes spoiled after years of great thai restaurants in California.',4
'Gallo Blanco is a great addition to The Clarendon Hotel.  Locals and out of towners alike can enjoy both the hotel and the restaurant.  (and if you let the hotel know youre a local they will give you a 10% discount - my favorite staycation spot!)   Gallo Blanco is the perfect place to go with your family or friends for breakfast on the patio on a beautiful day. Its also a fun date night with your special someone and great for girls night out at the same time.  Very versatile. The decor is entertaining (the ladies lips shaped mens urinal Ive heard about? hilarious!)    Lets talk about the food shall we?  The Naco Torte is my favorite sandwich anywhere in the entire Valley!   If you want healthy options you can try the oatmeal for breakfast or the shrimp tacos for dinner.  mmmm (I just salivated a little writing this...)  Theres a key lime tart not on the menu that is ah-maz-ing!    On to the drinks now. Grab a drink and go hang by the pool or in the rooftop. For the non-alcoholic drinks you must try the agua frescas. So fresh and delightful.  This is also the place to go for a little day or evening drinking because their cocktails are very tasty -  go for El Ruso or El Julio - my favorites!  (we even recreated them at home but definitely not quite as good).  Happy hour is 3 - 6 and the prices are great.   Cant beat this delicious food great ambiance and cool place!',5
'Always packed!  The atmosphere is always better than the coffee or the service but I just cant stay away.',2
'If eating a pizza cookie is wrong I dont want to be right.  Oreganos in Scottsdale is a fantastic fun place to get some Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere maybe while catching a ballgame on the TV.  Theres a pizza pie for everyone regardless of your preference - deep dish thin crust original you name it. Do yourself a favor and get the guacamole. Holy Moly! I could have survived on that alone.  The wait stuff are young and fun and I even did something I never do at a restaurant - I bought a T-shirt. A baseball jersey-style Oreganos shirt that remains one of my favorite tees.  Sidle up to the bar if thats your thing youll get great service conversation and of course food. or bring a date and enjoy pizza lasagna spaghetti you name it.  Parking is sparse and the wait may be a little long (get there early for lunch) but its well worth it.  I just wish there was an Oreganos near me in Michigan.',4
'Awesome wings! Try the raspberry chipotle...   Service is hit or miss but ate on the patio today and had an exceptional server! Seriously try the bone-in wings!',4
'So. Much. Fun.  We really thought we wouldve been in the top 2 since the majority of places we went told us that we were the 1st people they saw but a big congrats to the actual winners anyway. ;)  Lindsey U. and I had so much stinkin fun trying to figure out the clues and running around Old Town. We discovered a few places that wed never heard of that well likely be back to finally made it to a few places wed heard of but never made it to before Sun and were required to visit at least two old faves.  Cant wait for the next one! Thanks Lindsey and Local First!',5
'I went for an early afternoon trip to the driving range. This is the closest one from my hotel. I decided to play after a bucket. The course was in good condition. Forgiving and flat. Not a lot of challenge except for the greens. They are so sloooow.  $ typical city course.  Lots of public walkers in the course so watch out for errant shots.  Not bad for a quickie round before sundown!',3
'Geographical proximity has always been a bane for my proclivity for good authentic exotic food. Needless to say that has never stopped me from trying all the close establishments. Chinese food being one of my favored cuisines led me to be easily convinced to accompany me colleagues to this joint. The first impression was quite decent. Also the fact that it was once a Vietnamese establishment that catered to wedding parties gave it a pseudo garish pomp. Ordered the egg[plant steamed fish green beans... while friends ordered the kung pao lemon chicken (oh lawrdy!! bleah...). Not bad not bad  I mused to my self and put it down as another place to revisit.  However every subsequent  revisits here has been a horrible experience in terms of food. At one point I managed to peek at non-chinese cooks making our dishes. Sigh! one of those precipitously  going bad joints ratified by their 6 health code violations. Ah well on to Swadee...',1
'This place never fails to delight. Ive been eating here more or less since they opened. My favourites are the tomato beef (probably not everyones cup of tea as its a little slimy I guess) garlic eggplant/tofu and either the Singapore or the Yang Chow fried rice. Ive heard that the Orange Chicken is awesome Im not a big fan of this dish so Ive never had it here but at some stage Ill see if I can convince the wife to get some then try a small bit to see what the fuss is about. The only thing keeping this place from getting four stars is that its a little on the pricy side - I bought an order of their (new) Taiwanese style beef and an order of Yang Chow rice and the total came to almost $20. Entrees come with a small side of boiled rice probably about 20c worth in the scheme of things. Id have felt far more comfortable paying about $10-12 and in fact your dollar buys you plenty more food at Chen and Wok down the road which is almost as tasty (and THEY have pork w/black mushroom! :-) At any rate Buddha is a great little Chinese place in Surprise clean well-run great selection of food but something that unfortunately I have to consider a rare treat based on cost.',3
'A bunch of us chilled in the pool at the Talking Stick Resort on July 3 with a record breaking high temperature of 114. After taking the advice of a nice employee who was riding around the parking lot in a golf cart I parked in the garage. That was good advice cuz I had covered parking all day.   You need to walk through the smokey casino and then outside to get to the pool. The pool is huge with an ample supply of lounge chairs surrounding it. The restrooms were clean (thats a good thing!) There are three pool bars but I never had to go to any of them because of the numerous servers walking around. None of our group got a room so I cant review that but the pool was great. Cathy was our server. She took care of us.  Im adding this to my Resort Pool Crashing review list. I would rate this experience 5 stars for not charging women anything to use the pool but four stars for having such a limited poolside menu. There wasnt a single healthy choice on there. I have to admit that the brat with sauerkraut was pretty tasty and Ill probably order another one the next time I go. I asked for barbeque chips and got jalopeno pepper chips. NO thank you! I didnt eat them.   I plan to return on a non-holiday weekend if they let me in without having a room.   fdglikdffier',4
'Was the Fiesta Inn for a company party some coworkers stayed  so I got to check out a few rooms the rooms them self are nice the 3 that I did see were all styled a little differently one of the bathrooms you can tell there was water damage in the shower area but that was about it. I dont think I would personally stay at the fiesta but the company party was great! The event was catered by the Fiesta Inn and the food was delish!! Had a great time!',3
'FEZ burger is very very good.  If youre looking for a great burger that has a different flavor go with the FEZ burger.',5
'I LOVE THIS PLACE! So much that I wont blow dry my own hair anymore! Bailey Lauren Katie Liz - Everyone there is amazing and I leave there feeling like Im on the way to a photo shoot or something. I have kinky frizzy nasty hair and they make it look like silk in 30 mins and since I buy packages of 4 for only $25! (still pretty inexpensive at $35 if you prefer not to go that route) AND I was so pleased with the results of my hair that I tried a facial. This girl combined a microdermabrasion dermaplaning a peel and a deep pore extraction all together! I have never experienced anything like it. My skin has been dewy like a 25 year old for the past week. Seriously. And all natural products without chemicals. It was a teeny pricey at $125 but then again I have nothing to compare it to. I wish she could do it to my whole body! They also have $39 options. I will try that and let you know how that goes.',5
'I found this place to have a great beer selection and some pretty good music.  I plan on going back',4
'Great drinks and bartenders but thats where it ends. Hostess stand and table staff too slow. People waiting outside and multiple empty tables unbussed outside. Saw one couple steal a dirty table. Hostess noticed and did nothing which caused an argument with the server. Very unprofessional. Give them time they might improve.',3
'Great prices',4
'Coming here a few times I quickly learned that this is one of the smaller JImmy John and you should most likely pick up your food and eat somewhere else. The employees were mediocre and so was the sandwich. Not being able to eat pork made ordering a sub pretty hard. Their is a very small selection of only turkey subs which I hate about the place. I feel that if they included more turkey subs they would be able to have more business. The place also was pretty packed when I arrived so my friends and I could sit and eat their unless we wanted to wait their for another 20 minutes. Anyways I enojoy the subs their I just wish they had a larger selection of turkey subs and more seating for the customers.',2
'Great food served in a French ambiance by attentive servers. Expensive but good for special occasions.  Good selection of wines but limited beer choices.',4
'No - this is not a review of the pasties that women wear to cover up nipples underneath their clothing or instead of bathing suit tops... this is a review for Cornish pasties... and to be honest I didnt know what they were either until I read the 133 reviews that came before mine!  So I finally made my way to Cornish Pasty Company today after months and months of seeing the reviews roll in and now I know why there are so many CP fans.  This place is great!  Its kind of a British pub atmosphere inside. Really laid back and comfortable - and mostly men dining... my party balanced it out as the three of us brought some estrogen inside!  The menu consists of a diverse variety of pasties which are like calzones or English hot pockets.  They are all homemade with fresh ingredients and many of them sound super yummy; i had a hard time deciding what to order...   I went with the chicken greek pasty while my dining companions went with the carne adovada and the spicy asiago chicken.  I think we were all pretty happy with our respective orders.  I noticed they have large salads on the menu also.  Im thinking perhaps next visit Ill try a salad - maybe even go with someone who has similar tastes to me and split a pasty and a salad?  Any takers?  Either way Ill be back - it may have been my first Cornish Pasty experience but it will not be my last!',4
'First of all I want to establish that I love the fact that this venue now exists and I think its got great ideas overall. The lineup has been phenomenal and non-stop so far and the location is great. I plan on seeing Phantogram as my third show there so far.  I must also establish though that being under 21 at this venue absolutely sucks. First youre sent to a back entrance after you get your ticket validated at the front entrance where you see people eating great food and having a great time outside. Upon entering through the back you have three choices: go straight into the Kiddie Corral that makes up 1/4 of the whole crowd area hang out in the dark bathroom or check out the merch table. When I saw St. Vincent at Crescent Ballroom I literally stood in the same spot for 30 minutes just so I could get a decent view of Annie. I couldnt move because it was so crowded and if I did move the only view I would be able to get wouldve been the back of the drummers head. Also where I was standing the sound was really distorted since the speakers were right above and in front of us. Everyone was wincing and plugging one of their ears to bear it; It was way too loud at least in that instance. I saw Unknown Mortal Orchestra there a few weeks prior though and that sounded pretty great...but the crowd was a lot smaller and thus I wasnt stuck directly in the speakers line of fire.  I asked the two security guards at the back entrance 1. What do I do if I want something to drink other than water? and 2. What do I do if I want to get something to eat? To both questions they answered Just flag one of us security guards down well take care of you. What so Im going to tell you I want something youre going to leave your post to get me a menu wait for me to choose give my order to the kitchen and then bring my food to me so I can eat it standing up in the corner of the Kiddie Corral? I dont think thats very logical personally.  I just dont understand the logic of the whole map of the place. If youre 21 I would imagine its a fantastic experience but I wouldnt know since Im 18 and not allowed to see more than the upper left corner of the building. Oh and theres no re-entry even though youre stamped and usually braceleted! Its almost unbearable when the whole place is unceasingly loud and dark and stuffed with people and there is only a corner of available space to merely move in. I pay a good amount to get in to this nice local venue I would expect to simply be able to get back in if I want to get a breath of fresh air.',3
'Great atmosphere. Superstition coffee Id located at this site. They small batch roast their beans on site. So rich and deep flavor in their espresso roast.   The cafe is great lots of choices. I had the eggs Benedict for breakfast. Good size portion. Lots if feat options for salads and picnic type foods for eating outside in picnic tables or lay out a blanket and enjoy a real country picnic!   The cafe and seating get full and seating can be scarce!',4
'I love love love did I mention LOVE fox concept restaurants?  Having said that I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by the menu and this location in general.  It was just mediocre.  nothing about it was bad and nothing about it was good.  If I were in the area again I might go in depending on my mood.  At this location probably not I would rather go to North.  Also Fox but DAMN GOOD.   Service was fair to average.  Same with food.',3
'Love the dessert but beware of the Oh My Afagato...especially if you are a caffeine light weight like myself. We went here after my birthday dinner and I made the mistake of ordering it without realizing that it came with vietnamese coffee ice cream not vanilla. I could not understand why I was laughing so much and felt  and was motivated to just start running (i didnt!). After my realization I traded with my fiance and ate the rest of his Everything but the kitchen sink. The combo of salty crunchy and sweet was perfect.',5
'The first reviewer said this was near ASU-- totally incorrect it is not anywhere near ASU. It is near Elliott and the I-10 almost to Chanlder.   That said this place IS crazy or at least eclectic. Where else could you get sushi apple strudel braised chicken feet chicken teriyaki kim chi AND a nice ice cream desert? All for just over $7 for lunch. The food is generally excellent with the proviso that you get there before 1pm. After about 1pm the buffet gets pretty picked over and since very few people are eating anymore it isnt replenished as quickly as one might like.  BUT the sushi is fresh the strudel hot the egg drop and won ton soup is great as is the chicken feet (if you like that sort of thing) crab salad pizza (I forgot about that earlier) as well as the other mostly chinese dishes available. No matter what you are in the mood for it is here at the Crazy Buffet.',5
'Man Lolos makes some great food. I zealously ordered way too much (and ate every bite). I had the #10 - the Tre Tre - two legs and a waffle with a side of smothered potatoes. When I asked what the potatoes were smothered with I got quite a look from the waiter. (What a white girl he probably thought.)  I got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle. Oh yeah it hit the spot!  My friends all had similar items but different sides. The collards are true southern greens the fried okra is perfect and the beans on rice has great flavor. This is the mother of all weekend breakfast/brunch meals. Delight in its glory!',4
'Thank you Yelp... I only wish i had six Stars... Ok officially for anyone reading this pretend there are Six Freaking Stars... This place is THAT good!  I thank Yelp because the only way I found this place was searching for third wave coffee (those who know what I mean by this will just know... everyone else will just have to experience and forever after never drink Starbucks again) while I was traveling in Tempe.    I dont like coffee I LOVE it (insert Antono Ego voice from Ratatouillie movie here)... I literally have a coffee shrine in my house where I run a vintage Rancilio Z11 and pride myself on my espresso skills.  Simply put I will never pull a shot like i had here.  Off the chart awesome!    So thats the first 5 Stars...the Sixth star?? I just cant believe they have GOOD pastry too!  I understand they produce in-house and if thats true then its completely astounding.  Easily the best croissant Ive had outside of Paris.  Run dont walk to the Coffee Lab; it is worth the flight to Tempe.',5
'I was just at US nails and I was really unimpressed.  I used to come here all the time and they used to be so friendly.  I took one of my family members to get their nails done for their birthday.  Right after she cleaned my nieces nails while my niece was still in the chair she told me the total amount of money due.  I said okay thank you I will pay in cash.  Then the lady insisted that I pay right then and there at the chair.  I respondedIve been here many times and Ive always paid after...has that changed?  She responded yes.  However everyone else paid AFTER their nails were completed.  I felt like that was unfair very very unfair.  Plus I thought that was really unhygienic of her to handle cash in the middle of cleaning and polishing my nieces nails.  My niece received the French styled nails and the lady left white smudges on the un-tipped parts of the nails.  I am thoroughly disappointed.',1
'For airport food they make a decent burger.  Ordinarily I would give the burger itself three stars but again relative to your typical airport food this is a good choice.',4
'I have nice teeth no cavities no big gaps nothing...just nice teeth.  So when I refer people to Dr. Tricoli they say you dont have any problems with your teeth--why would I listen to you? Because I have nice teeth.... And a GREAT dentist! The office is clean relaxing and friendly.  The assistant is friendly and very thorough.  The receptionist Christi is a doll and very nice and accomodating. The dentist Dr. Martin Tricoli is AWESOME! He is not a product or procedure pusher and is top notch in his skills.  He is friendly fun (yes I said fun) and professional.  Hell clean your teeth and fix up your problems (I can say that now that so many of my friends trusted me and went to him) and will not push you into anything you dont need....and I love that!',5
'Awesome for having so much bike parking awesome for having a cool place with lots of seating and lots of room. Why do they need so much room? because this place gets so busy it induces claustrophobia.  The atmosphere inside reminded me of the german restaurant Mark Rattner took Stacy to in Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  all in all I thought it was an average place that was way too busy. I mean it was like a rock concert crowd and took insane amounts of time to get a drink. Maybe it was a bad night.',3
'This year I decided that I wanted to get more into beer. I love wine and know a lot about what I like when it comes to that but until this year beer was a different story. A friend of mine started introducing me to various types of beer and from then on Ive made it my years project to learn to about all the varieties of beer and what I like the same way I have with wine.  Enter Taste of Tops. Taste of Tops is next door to Tops Liquor on University and is exactly what the name implies its a bar where you can taste the selection available at Tops. They only serve beer and wine to my knowledge but they have a great selection of specialty brews on tap (dont order Bud Light here.) They also have a huge variety of bottles you can grab. They have food as well but a very small selection and Ive never been very impressed with it. On the other hand Thai Basil is right next door and they dont mind if you bring that in with you.  This is a great place to start your night (theyre only open till 12) and if youre into beer or trying to learn about beer its a great place to try new things!',4
'The Yard House is my go to spot in the afternoon--not because they have super awesome food but simply because they meet my particular lunchtime criteria: - prompt service - broad lunch selection that include edible salads - skinny margaritas - booth seating in a dark corner (so I can read my smutty novels in peace)  If you have the same set of requirements as above--Huzzah! Yard House is the place for you!  If you just want to sit around and drink beer--Yay! You are still in the right spot.  If you want really great cuisine?  Hmm Maybe you might try another restaurant... not that Yard House is bad (it isnt).  It is just more of a socializing place than a place to really sit and enjoy the food.',3
'09/14/10  My first visit to Ruth Chris and I have to say not bad not bad at all!  I really liked the subdued atmosphere- white-clothed tables yet not too stuffy intimate bar area but still allowed for personal space; and music set to very low (great for conversation or working w/ a laptop).  Bartender was not too aloof yet eager to answer any question when I had any.    Have you had a chance to look over Ruth Chris HH (happy hour) menu yet?  Theres a lot to choose from!  Now that I think of it Im surprised I havent been back since.  After studying the menu for many minutes I decided Id try the burger which Id like to say was $12 (or was it $9?).  Whatever the cost it was worth it!  Perfectly-grilled and juicy eight-ounce patty topped w/ a GENEROUS amount of blue cheese some partially-melted (oh my!) on top of a buttered and grilled bun.  The burger also came w/ lovely and superbly-crisped fries!  Not a soggy one in the bunch which was great in the short-term but not-so-great for me in the long-term (so many extra calories Id normally be saving by ditching soggy fries!  LOL).  A must-order entree!  BTW I tried a little of the complimentary sourdough table bread and butter while waiting for my meal- crusty good stuff!',4
'grrr cant recomend this place any more....  First 2 times I whent suprisingly good. Chicken Quesedia...better than taco bell ok ambiance...  last to times.... DJ from LA ment  no room to eat or drink....fire mashall shut down packed....   and once had the pink tacos and wasnt as good as I remeber....  so a chain that doesnt have consistancy? may be I was drinking more on the days the food was good?',3
'Good place friendly staff.',4
'This is the best dance studio Scottsdale has to offer.  It is often hard for a beginning student to select a good dance studio.  All the dance instructors appear great to a beginner.  But not all of them are great.  Many are just learning themselves--some with only a few weeks training.  Dance instruction can be expensive.  To obtain value the quality of your instructor is critical.  This is where Roberts Ambiant Studio excells.  Robert has created an atmosphere that has attracted some of the best instructor talent in the valley.  Many have competed nationally and internationally.  They continue to take coaching themselves to hone their skills.  They love dance and make the learning process fun.  And the best part is that the cost of an experienced professional instructor at Roberts studio is no more than the cost for a beginner instructor at some other studios.  Instruction is available for students at all skill levels from beginners taking a group lesson to ballroom dance competitors. In addition to quality instruction the atmosphere is friendly welcoming and very supportive.  This is a reflection of Roberts own personality.   When we first visited Ambiant Dance we were met personally by Robert who greeted us with  Welcome Home.   He meant it.  This place feels like home.',5
'This is my hood yo. Ive been eating at TE since I can remember. Since before high school Im sure but it is in high school that my most fond memories come from. After football practice this was a must.   Ive always been a fan of the terriyaki chicken double meat. Havent strayed much from that honestly. So... Maybe its time to try something else.   Ive wanted to try the curry but after going to Tokyo and having curry there Im hesitant to try it. Well see....  Thanks for the memories Tokyo Express.',4
'I love the Blooze! Thursday rockabilly nights are awesome! Theres a great checkered dance floor to dance the night away! The owner is the nicest guy you will ever meet. Theres hardly ever a cover and drinks are cheap! If youre looking for fun on a budget this is the place!   P.s. If you sit at one of the tables check out the awesome pictures on them! My favorite is the prohibition table.  P.p.s. Girls... You have to look in the bathroom... Theres pictures of hunky guys on the inside of the stalls... Theres even pictures of Tumbleweed (the owner)!',5
'Large resort in the desert. Great pool area with the chairs that have flags to raise to get service. Plus its pet friendly.',5
'I found myself here staring at the menu thinking they have whole and half omelets what can the difference really be?  I decided that theres no way a whole omelet anywhere could beat me.  I was very very wrong.   The full omelet here is truly impossibly huge. Im rarely beaten by breakfast but wow.  The bacon and avocado that it was stuffed with was the perfect combination of flavors.  The toast was a little on the underdone and cool side but in the face of that heap of eggs and hash browns it kind of gets pushed aside anyway.',4
'WOW! That is all I can say is WOW! You would have never guessed I did a 12+ mile and 28 obstacle race in Utah ( in which I had to climb the mountains 3 times)  just recently the way that this mountain kicked my butt. I will chalk it up to me still being a little tired/sore from that race for my failure to keep up. Yea that was it! LOL. I loved every grueling minute of it and the views are spectacular. Plus I even got to see some AMAZING houses that are hidden behind the mountainside. I really cannot wait to do it again even though it was the stair master from HELL!!',5
'Ok really nothing special.  AT $3.50 a pop.....well thats the upscale area of Scottsdale for ya!.  Not worth the price BUT in that area its par.  They are not nasty but not great.  The staff however are great!  Some of the most friendly I have seen in a while.',3
'I may be biased since I got married at this resort about a month ago but this might be one of my favorite places...I would live there if I could.  I was there for two weeks for my wedding and I already want to go back.  The resort is unbelievable...it has everything you could possible need... including an AMAZING water playground (where you will spend most of your time) delicious restaurants a 24 hour a coffee shop beautiful rooms and great service.  Im not sure if all Hyatts require that the staff go out of their way and bend over backwards to make sure  you enjoy your stay but at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch that is exactly what they do.  I know there are a lot of resorts in Scottsdale but this one is a must!  And if you can get a casita do it!  By the end of our stay I think all the staff from the bellmen to the bartenders knew our names and our drinks of choice!  Everything about this place is perfect...so check it out...youll probably see me there!',5
'Who doesnt love the Bungalow?  They make my food to order...and I change everything.  Sometimes the cook even delivers with a personal message...lemme know how you like that etc.  Its great for happy hour but my only gripe is parking is limited.',4
'Losbetos is the bomb. So dirt cheap and you get so much food. I live across the street so its super convenient for me which I love! Its open 24 hours which is the shit. I havent been there at any really odd hours as of yet but I like knowing I have the option and I also presume I will end up there at some weird hours at some point. Theyre carne asada chicken and huevos rancheros are all soooo good. You will be in a serious food coma after you eat here.',4
'Barfly finally changes the rules of eating at the Airport. They have a solid (but simple) menu and the food is cooked fresh. For those of you who have the displeasure of eating at the Airport regularly you know that most of the food was made yesterday or just popped in the microwave. Barfly provides a decent menu and the food is cooked fresh. They introduce fresh vegetables and ingredients in their menu that is a welcome change. If you are in the A terminal at Phoenix Airport and have time this is where you want to stop and eat and maybe grab a drink.   I will be back.',4
'I always have a great time when Im here! The staff is incredible and the food is Amazing! Best chicken wings in Tempe indeed',5
'UPDATE:  Looks like the health department can confirm my personal experience.  5 negative findings on their most recent inspection (http://phoenix.about.com/library/blrestinspectbad0613.htm). Meanwhile the owners keep messaging me to get me to delete my review.  Oh Curry Corner.  I loved you since the day I met you.  Your takeout orders were usually wrong.  But I forgave you for each time I came inside my food was just right.  I was wierded out by your self-service beverages and your water always tasted so awful that I drank tea or soda.  I figured it was a ploy to sell drinks and I was OK with that because your food was so cheap and so delicious.  I was excited to come in last week to find Guy Fieris visit (cant stand the dude...wtf is with his hair...SERIOUSLY) prompted a major renovation.  Gone were the mostly disgusting and crappy booths near the kitchen.  Hardly an improvement to remove booths and replace with tables and chairs but this was.  They cleaned it up. And it looked great!  Well I was pumped that my friend who is mostly an Indian food virgin enjoyed this place and his first foray to the cuisine.  So much so that (well until he reads this review) I couldnt bear to tell him what I saw when we checked out.  A roach.  Not a dead one.  One still clinging to its life.  Legs in the air like he just didnt care.  I immediately bugged (ha!) my friend who had originally turned me on to the place to tell him my woeful tale of a roach at Curry Corner.  OH he said?  I saw one the last time I was there but I assumed it was just a fluke.  No.  It was not.  And no thanks CC.  Im over you.',1
'Blanco is a welcome addition to the biltmore fashion park!   Two friends and I met for lunch here on a Monday.  We were seated in a raised booth that overlooks the restaurant and outside.  Chips and salsa were basic and we got the roasted corn and the queso to dip.  Both the queso and corn were absolutely delicious!  For my entree I had the short rib and avocado cheese crisp which was super yummy and crispy! It was not greasy like some crisps can be.  My friends tried the chicken tacos (loved them) and some sort of enchiladas.  Our server Keisha (sp) was very sweet! She kept our drinks full and came back to check on us at all the right times.  She also took our photo for us- twice!!   Also the taco window across from Williams Sonoma is open daily until 4 pm and has a few select items to grab and go.  Ive tried the chicken tacos queso and cheese quesadilla from the window which are all straightforward and fresh.',5
'Its a Jack-In-The Box.   I dont eat here very often for myself but my dad likes it and I go through the drive-thru quite a bit to get him breakfast since hes handicapped and doesnt drive.   What I like:   1) Its never crowded. Theres never a line. They dont make mistakes.   2) They actually have good customer service. Theres a woman whos often at the drive-thru in the mornings thats particularly pleasant and Ive been known to laugh at her jokes occasionally.   And hey Ive been known to get a breakfast croissant occasionally (Im only human) and although theyre greasy I cant deny theyre tasty...',4
'Great lunch specials and daily $.99 items. Always a great meal. Love this and all Filibertos but this one is walking distance from my place and is open 24 hours soooooo yeah. What more could anyone really ask for? Typical food you all know what their food is all about but I really like this location. Not just because its super close and I can get great Mexican food at any hour of the day the inside is unique. They have a few fun games and a bigger than average seating area if you need a cheap good place to eat at 3am! I love fresh Mexican food especially late at night. Thank goodness we live in Arizona and 3 minutes from this gem!',4
'This is the first Yelp Review Ive ever really agonized over.   The Sugar Bowl is an Old Town Scottsdale class.  Bright pink exterior and old fashioned Letters in the window.  The interior has the same kitchie charm. Family Circus Comics all over cute old fashioned bricabrac in the store and on the walls.   But the food the food is... well awful.  I ordered the assorted finger sandwiches - and the bread was stale and in addition to tuna salad and egg salad there is some kind of... ham salad. When I asked about what was in the finger sandwiches telling me a ham sandwich might have been more acuratly described as a ham salad sandwich - I took a bite and left the rest alone.   The ice cream is good nothing special. The sundaes are fun again nothing special.   But there is something that makes me bring my out of town guest here when a trip to Cold Stone might be tastier.   I hope someone comes in improves the menu but keeps the charm.',3
'We ordered some take out pizza and wings of course. I do not eat wings but I asked specifically how GOOD they were so this was just the popular consensus from the guys that the wings were very good and hot but NOT better than Kellys Grille wings they still boasted that theirs are still KING so check my review for Kellys if you want wings.   The pizza: mine was just cheese a little over cooked and not crispy. Eh! Maybe if it served there its better?? Any who I plan on going back  minus the pizza and wing crowd for some dinner. They did get New Times Readers Choice Best Neighborhood Italian in 06. If that even means anything here anyway I will update soon.',3
'We visited Pita Jungle two consecutive nights while travelling in AZ. The first night fantastic. Good service waiter knowledgable of vegan items on their menu great food. I had their hummous/tabbouleh plate and it was *enormous*. Normally I make it my mission to finish my food (waste is my TOP peeve) but I just could not do it. So much delicious hommous...perfectly smooth though not too thin not too much garlic nor oil. And the fresh tabbouleh...yum. Nice and parsley-y. Easy on the mint (I detest too much mint in food). The pita however was a dissapointment. Too chewy. I could not eat that either. -Which is not good for a place called PITA Jungle.  Mum loved her pesto pizza (on a pita). Though it was a bit heavy on the cheese the pita crust remained crisp. We shared a yummy eel river ale and table water (which def. needed some lemon).  The next night we tried to order another ale but as it was friday night and they are in a lot with a cinema they were quite busy and had run out of glasses. Not just chilled glasses all glasses. Never a good sign.   Then we ordered a cup of lentil soup for my nephew. It came out after a time but not in a cup -a HUGE salad bowl. Er is this your cup of soup? We ran out of cups. And apparently they were running out of soup...because it seemed like the dregs and was ice cold.   Luckily the clean glass and beer arrived. Followed shortly by our other food another pita pizza for my mum and the Falafel plate for me and my nephew. Thankfully these items redeemed the night. Mum liked the Pita Pizza even more than the other (perfectly prepped mushrooms and a bit less cheese) and again the falafel plate was such a generous portion that there was plenty for my wee nephew and I to share (since he had no soup). The falafel were delicious hot crisp outside soft within not too salty nor oily. The baby loved them. Came with lettuce tomato cucumber and pickles! -which are not mentioned on the menu so do NOT order extra as I did and risk the stink eye from your waitress and an abundance of pickles (albeit tasty ones).  We ended up enjoying ourselves yet again but we had to wait quite a time for our bill and then had to remind the waitress to remove the lentil soup. So great food huge portions great prices but woo... they need to be ready for friday nights.',4
'This is not the original Hobby bench which is by Bookmans but I find little to differentiate the two.  A general service hobby shop covering everything from model trains and RC to needlework and basic art supplies.    So you arent going to find super specialized items but you will find some of everything.  If you need basic supplies - in my case paint tools - this is the place.  Like an old time hobby store - you never know what you may find lurking on the shelves here.  So fun place to browse.  We dont have too many choices in hobby shops in Phoenix but either Hobby Bench is worth a stop occasionally.',4
'Looks like they closed sigh.',5
'Met up here with a large group for HH earlier tonight.  It was my first visit to this new location and it was pretty busy for a Thursday.  While I might try it again just due to the location the service was so horrible that it will be a long time before I consider organizing another large group function there.    I arrived after my groups first round had been served and I think it was almost 30 minutes before I could get a drink!  Furthermore one of the guys in our group finally went up to the bar to get a round of drinks since so many of us had been waiting so long and he was turned around and told to go sit and wait for the server.  Not cool after a long day at the office!  That combined with turning off the misters a bit too early on a hot evening = a one drink and bad first impression HH for me.',2
'The food is consistently good. Good selection of wines and pasta in their little market. Be prepare to wait about 20 minutes for your order especially when its busy.',4
'I used to go to Robbie Foxx prior to the restaurant changing ownership and name to public house. I was hoping that not too much had changed I was a bit disappointed. I cant blame them they are situated down the street from asu so it makes sense they would attempt to be appealing to a college crowd. But thats not my scene.   The tv setup is weird and awkward the seating options are either bar height tables or low couches. The food was incredibly salty. At least they still had strongbow on tap.   I had the fish and chips and I could literally feel the salt crystals on the fish/batter. The shoestring fries were also over salted which is a shame both the portion size and the width of the fries (TRUE shoestrings) made the plate look perfect. But the taste was disappointing. My husband had the meatloaf which he said was also too salty but their side of mashed potatoes was really really tasty.   I dont believe Ill return but for those looking for a relatively mellow college scene bar might enjoy it.',3
'R.I.P. Baghdad restaurant. It is now a Kabob restaurant that is good but not as good as Baghdad was.',4
'OK hamburger stuff - yea just OK.  Ill go to Five Guys in a heart beat before I return here.  The burger was decent; the onion rings Id rather forget.  Oh - if a Five Guys isnt around point me at the closest Culvers',3
'Bass Pro believe it or not took a stand with Bank of America against gun rights.  I know that sounds weird but hear me out and then research it yourself.  McMillan Firearms (based right here in AZ) had banked with BofA for many many years.  One day a VP from BofA went and told McMillan that they didnt want to do business with them anymore because McMillan was in the gun business.  Then McMillan asked other gun related businesses do not do business with BofA but Bass Pro actually came out in support of BofA.  The connection?  BofA runs Bass Pros credit card network.    I will NEVER shop at Bass Pro again.',1
'Cool place. I had a good experience with a few complaints.  First i must say the server was very friendly and attentive. she gets 5 stars from me. they had a DJ there that was playing Reggae tunes I really appreciated that.  THE FOOD: Salmon bruchetta Breakfast potatoes and eggs were enjoyable. The sweet potatoes in the sweet potato hash were undercooked. The French toast and pizza were STALE. my friend said the pancakes were good  The Value:  All you can eat brunch bottomless mimosas and vodka drinks for $20 !? i def feel like i got my moneys worth.  Overal:  The negative things I have to say are attributed to the brunch being a buffet . certain items wont taste fresh in a buffet setting its up to them to stick with the items that fare wellbut biting into something stale is not good.  I wont slam the too hard on this because i still found enough items that were good enough to make my meal complete. I also realize that this place is not a buffet joint and Ive been told that their dinner specials and entrees are really good.  ill try the dinner may be compelled to raise my rating because i do like this place and the value they offer',3
'I went here with my family on a Sunday evening which was great because on Sunday kids eat for free. My husband ordered a shrimp pizza which was heavenly and I ordered the Caprese sandwich which was ok. Next time I will definitely order a pizza. The staff was really nice and the food arrived pretty quickly which is important when youre trying to entertain three kids.  The atmosphere here is great - really laid back and casual. The night we went they had a guy playing acoustic guitar which was a nice plus. I will definitely go back.',4
'I use to live a street over from this restaurant it was a treat to go in there. They are such nice welcoming people. We would make it at least a weekly thing to eat there. I would always get the vegetarian platter or the falafel both amazing! THe owner is sooo nice and his daughter is also very friendly and super sweet!!! I havent been here in a while thats why I gave the 4. I think a trip down there will definitely change my review!',4
'Burritos are mediocre. But the tacos arent bad.',3
'Ima put it this way you arent finding a fresher gyro.  The pita the meat the sauce.  Best in the area.  Even if you gotta drive 3 or 4 miles definitely worth it.  Ive tried everywhere else and they just dont make em as big or as well as chicago gyros.  The owner is a stand up guy and they have frequent buyer cards that have great discounts on them.    Not the cheapest but at $8-10 for a combo meal youre not getting better food for the same price elsewhere.  Great atmosphere and good music tv is always on the game or nfl network maybe cnn sometimes.  Staff is really friendly and helpful.  Not really a sit down restaurant but plenty of room for 2-4 people(maybe 6 max).',5
'Beer selection great atmosphere like an out of place ski lodge in the desert pool tables partial broken....not much else to say.  I guess this place is a decent place to go once to check it out I cant say I would bother going again. I guess between the extremely bright lights and eclectic ski lodgian decor it just doesnt tickle my fancy.  (if I even had a fancy)   My date and I relived some moments of our past and played a challenging game of pool similar to when we first met. We had some drinks and played reindeer games and chatted and joked. No doubt it was a great time. I guess atmosphere has become even more important for me lately even if the beer selection is wide ranging and the prices are excellent. This place definitely screams  I make great pizza I swear! It seems like you could potential get a good pizza pie here even if it looks as if Vale Colorado vomited inside this place.  Colorado is not known for its pizza so I am not sure if I can trust it.   Overall Boulders gets a 3 because of the beer selection that aside it is a low 2 rating.',3
'We were with Monotronics for at least five years.  At first everything was going good until we found out that for six months they were not receiving a signal from our home which means that if we had a true emergency such as burglary or panic button they would not receive the signal.  What tickles my elmo is that FOR SIX MONTHS they were not receiving an signal and not once they did call us yet they are supposed to be monitoring my system 24 hours 7 days a week ?   Whatever !  We cancelled so beware of this company and any other company that promises to protect you and your home 24/7.',1
'0100 arrival for 150 gal of Jet A and a quick turn. Scruffy unshaven CAS dressed in ratty hooded sweatshirt did not project a professional image. When asked there was no change available for a $20.00 bill for vending machine. Not the level of service expected from a high end FBO. Well make another facility choice next time.',2
'Have always liked Sams Club over Costco. Since we moved to Surprise Sams Club is our only choice! This place has a huge parking lot very easy to access just like any other warehouse not much to ad. Their bakery is great always sending out fresh bread. Our biggest fave is their pizza not there cooked? But their pre-made refrigerated pizza is awesome. Just take it home and pop in the oven for 15 minutes. A very good pizza! But their snack bar is awesome also. Pizza and dogs are great!!',4
'Loved this place the menu really has something for everyone!  I went with my family (who are all meat eaters) and they ordered a rustica pizza penne with meat balls a calzone and salad and they loved it all. I had my own gluten-free vegan version of the provence pizza and it was truly delicious! We all loved our meal. The atmosphere is pretty casual and all of the staff was very friendly and accomodating. Loved!',4
'Its clean it doesnt smell and usually there is not problem with it being too crowded.  Being a Pure Fitness convert its a much better gym with a lot more to offer.  I learned how to play racquetball here so that kind of makes it special to me!  Only complaint is the old men who reserve the racquetball courts and try to kick us out 5 minutes before their reserved time... Sooooo annoying.',4
'SOOOOOO! After an hour of waiting for the food I decided to call and guess what? You guessed it...the food was just getting into the oven. i was then told another 15 minutes which ended up being 35 minutes. Never again!!!!',1
'A nice quiet place to sit and relax with a delicious cup of coffee or tea.  We found everyone here to be friendly...service with a smile.  The coffee house is nicely decorated with vintage coffee bean bags and beautiful pictures of various sites throughout Arizona.  Not much to complain about except for the food which I found to be okay at best.  We ate here twice and decided we would only stop in for coffee from now on.  I ordered an egg sandwich and a egg salad sandwich - both sandwiches were lacking key ingredients: the egg and the egg salad.  This is partially our fault though as we did eat lunch in a place that clearly states what it is - a coffee house.  Coffee and tea is what this place does best.  Better than Starbucks or any chain by a long shot.',4
'The first thing I noticed when I walked in is that the building is very well designed. So for architecture I give Z Tejas a strong grade.   Ill be honest I wasnt that excited to see this addition to the neighborhood. The Richardsons/Rokerji/Dicks Hideaway people do Southwest food about as well as it can be done and all are within an easy walk of Z. Neighborhood bar? Ill take any number of places including the Garage across the street. Im just not sure where Z Tejas fits.   The food is exactly what you would expect pretty good not great. If you have friends in town from rural Washington/Nebraska/Minnesota this will be exotic and outside their comfort zone from a flavor standpoint. Arizona people might think a little... Meh. I do like that they section out their menu to show the vegetarian listings always a positive to make things easier on the diners.   The southwest slaw (I think thats what its called) was one of the worst things Ive ever had. It tastes like somebody took cole slaw and added all the black pepper they could find. I like pepper so I can only assume this was a mistake or designed for a consumer that has almost no sense of taste.',3
'Ive been to Vs several times so that I could give them a fair chance. Each time I have found my experience to be lacking. The haircut was decent not what you expect from a Barber I said to take off an inch they took off 2.  The customer service was atrocious. Ive been to many different barber shops and expect a high level of service.  I expect the barber to try and make small talk with me even if its just asking what I do for a living.  Not only did the barbers not try but they were rude and would speak in Russian to each other rather than interact with me.  If your going to a barbershop.  I recommend Gios at 64th street and Bell or there is a shop at Tatum and Cave Creek that is great as well.',1
'As far as spas in Arizona...this one is fabulous. Not just because of their amazing treatments but b/c it is so indigenous to the Southwestern culture. The landscape is just amazingly breathtaking. You will feel relaxed pampered and serene.',4
'The 3D movie is great  and the butterflies are  amazing! this is a great place to bring out of town guessts or a great place to go if you an hour or 2 of extra time.  I highly recommend it.',4
'I had the smash fries and an Arizona burger both were really good. Luckily I was able to sneak in before the lunch rush there was a long line. I didnt like the paper lined wire mesh trays I thought I was going to make a mess. All-in-all great good and atmosphere. Check it out!',4
'I actually worked at this location in high school.  Its even where I met my husband (we worked there together).  We went back over the weekend to see Ides of March (which is great by the way) and were so disappointed to see what it has become.  First of all it says a lot that it was completely dead on a Saturday night.    I couldnt believe theyd closed off the entire east wing of the theater as well as the concession stand over in the west wing.  Granted theyre not regularly open it just looks tacky to have a fake wall and some game machines in front of it.  I came for a movie not a trip to the arcade.  There has clearly been a change in management since our last visit and since we worked there because this is not a theater worth heading to anymore.  Cold popcorn service so bad that I had to remind them to get or soda and charge my card and return it to me.  How about we dont take my card unless were going to charge it and hand it to me?  No sitting on the counter while you figure out how to grab a soda and popcorn.',1
'I went here tonight for a girlfriends birthday. Food was great. Our server was attentive but it did take a while to get our food and drinks. I highly recommend the soft pretzels with fondue so yummy! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni; the flavors were very rich and I was happy to see they had several vegetarian options. We also got to choose a complimentary desert and had the Monkey Bread. Sounded so-so but was delicious. Also I love decor! Comfy chairs that are different at every table and the gorgeous chandeliers make it feel very upscale. My only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks it was pretty loud a bit too dark and the portions were fairly small for the price.',3
'Oh Fez you and me...weve hooked up a few times.   Sometimes just for drinks a quick bite an early dinner a late dinner. but this last breakfast it put me over the top...Im movin in. Thats right you and me are hookin up! Cuz you are the real deal Holyfield and I like my restaurants smooth sweet to the touch and able to go the distance and you Fez you go the distance.   You serve up an amazing eggs benedict omelets that make a grown woman cry and a breakfast kisra bread that is a sweet bacony tangy cheesy deliciousness. Oh and the $5 mimosas...yeah Im not leaving you anytime soon. Call your mother youve got a new girlfriend!',5
'Worst experience ever! I had four trips to this place in one month..The doctor was trying to juice me here and there.Other then the gal named Crystal the staff was lost and none of them were on the same page.A lot of he said she said going on.Im going back to Sams clubnever to return!',1
'Yodel -Le - He-Ho!!!   Been dying for some food to remind you of the French Alps? Yes? Well I have got a beautiful place for you to try ... a bit of  yumminess right here on Bell rd... Crepes Tartines and Fondue ..what more could you ask for ? How about an ice cave ? Yes just when you thought that youd never see an ice cave for comedians and what not ..there it is...  Seriously... right on the Bar side of the restaurant... Okay new place to try kids and it is really tasty. Husband and  I had the Scallop/Mediterre  Savory Crepe which was lovely  and the Jamon Frankekuchen --which translates loosely   tasty ham / pear pizza with crescent roll crust   super delicious ... now the shocker was the over hazelnutation of the  sweet  crepe...   wholly  nutella folks  ...too much ... but yet we ate it all.  The interior begs for you to take this place seriously as a french  /swiss alps restaurant  and to be honest it does remind me of a bistro we ate in Lucerne Switzerland...  there  really is a fake ice cave ala the matterhorn area of Disneyland which the owner plans on using as a stage for comedians ..I am laughing already.  There also is a crepe cam  which shows the making of the crepes in the kitchen  and is televised to the bar  area..ah.. neat.     Call me and lets go get a crepe together!!',4
'Selection is good store is clean staff is friendly. They dont have some of the items I like to regularly buy though so... Ill shop somewhere else.',3
'Closed ---- Out Of Business.',1
'As Norma Desmond Said:  I am big.  Its the pictures that got small!  What a classic little space the Harkins Camelview 5 is. Walking into the entrance reminds me of the reason I fell in love with movies as a kid and ended up working in the motion picture industry for over 15 years.  Ive since come to my senses and returned to being a movie patron and fallen in love with the independent art-house and foreign films that play at the Camelview.  Although its not got the steep stadium seating as in the larger multi-plexes and you may feel as though you are further away from the screen its got tons of legroom and the new seats youre used to at other modern theaters.    Enjoy the show!  My Tip:  Invest in the Harkins T-Shirt & Cup and get free popcorn and $1.50 sodas at the concession all year long!',4
'Very good fresh authentic food that is prepard and served by a really nice family. This place is very informal. Exactly what I dont expect in Scottsdale. Bonus: All beers on tap are Mexican.',5
'**Update** - This is not a change in rating but I like to be fair.  We were charged for a 19th month after cancelling our contract prior to 18 months.  I called and spoke to Rob and he cordially and professionally resolved the issue.',2
'We received top notch service from Amanda. They cater to my wifes severe food allergies with out any hassle. Food always tastes great and is always hot. You dont always find service like this in a chain restaurant...',4
'Pho Avina is a lovely casual little place for excellent Vietnamese food.  The food is fresh and delightful.  The menu is extensive and has all the traditional Vietnamese dishes I expected.   In addition to Pho they serve other noodle (rice noodle and saigon noodle) and rice dishes as well as appetizers and salads. Under no circumstances would I compare it to Cyclo.  Cyclo is not a traditional Vietnamese restaurant... Pho Avina is.  I would compare the variety and quality to Saigon Pho on Alma school which is one of my favorite restaurants.  They also have a nice selection of boba drinks.  I had a coconut one this time. I have had Avocado Coffee and mango as well.  So far coconut is my favorite.  I think next time I will try taro.  mmmmm.... so good. I was so enamored with this place that I expect to stop there on the way home from work at least once every week or 2.  I need to add this note now..... since I first reviewed this place it has become a real favorite of mine.  I stop here at least 1 or 2 times a week and when I do I often run into friends who learned about the place from me.  Im headed there for dinner tonight.',4
'When I first walked in I was greeted with a hot mess of unorganized merchandise but proceeded to enter the store without injury. I walked by the beauty section and wasnt a fan of the layout but the lady behind the counter was friendly enough to flash a smile. The store in general seems smaller than other Walgreens and yet still the organization of items lacks. There was one cashier at checkout and she was nice and patient however the other customers in line were not. This Walgreens worked for my quick fix but is not anything special.',3
'Susie is just a short bike ride from The Villa here deep deep in the ghetto so I whipped on over here today to give her a try...  that is to give her food a try.     :-)  This is a medium sized restaurant with a big rather inviting covered patio a comfortable dining room and a full bar (!) in the other room thats cheery & light in the daytime not boozy.  For this first visit I ate in the dining room and went with Lunch Special #1 which conjured up a bowl of thick tasty tortilla chips along with two good salsas a hot red pureed one and a medium red chunky style.  Along with those I enjoyed a mug of beer FOR A PENNY!  Before long the rest of my order arrived consisting of a nice Carne Deshebrado hard taco and a medium sized Chile Verde Burrito.  Everything was delicious here and an excellent value at $7.25 + 1¢ for the beer=$7.26.  (Soft drink would have been optional also for the 1¢.)  This was really good!  The only thing holding them back from 5 Stars from me is that if you order anything other than one of the five Lunch Specials things get expensive.  My usual preferred Mexican combo order anywhere is a Chile Relleno a hard Deshebrado Taco refried beans Spanish Rice and of course chips and salsa.  That order here (#12) costs $10.95 & most everything on the regular menu is around that price.  With that said I liked this place a lot & think as long as you stick with the Lunch Specials its an awesome deal...  especially with that ice cold mug of Bud for a penny!  Can you imagine?¿?     :-))',4
'Berrygood is definitely missing something their yogurt is tolerable but its missing that tart flavor yogurt is supposed to have and it wasnt as sweet as I woud have liked. They also dont have a huge toppings selection to choose from.  I have to say I was disappointed. I had the mango sorbet which had a small hint of mango which means you could barely tell it was mango and I also got the chocolate one and it was so-so.',2
'This was our first time here. The server was a complete ___! Megan was her name. The overall feel of the place was pretty good. The food looked pretty good. Service was horrible so I didnt get far enough to get the full experience.',1
'Just had to go back for the great deal on pho.  This time the broth was piping hot and stayed that way after the noodles were loosened and we got crisper veggies although not much of it. . . All-in-all still 3.5 stars.',4
'I love this place and dont make it due to location nearly enough. From delicious shawarma with loads of garlic sauce (oh yeah I smell but Im happy) to gyros. My favorite is the homemade baklava.',4
'A lover of Sweet Tomatoes.....Will not be back to this location. It is VERY poorly set up. Unfortunately whoever set this location up was just not a good planner. The spot where you have to wait for a table is in the way of people trying to get to the drinks and hot foods and also right in front of the exit door. I have been to other locations and found the set up to be way better. Also the girl who rang us up scolded my husband and I for stepping a little out of line so that my mom could get by us to pay. She was not very friendly. Lastly I was sad because my reason for going was an ad stating that the monthly special was all of my favs....Tomato soup (very good) Grilled Cheese dippers (gross breadsticks with hard crusted cheese on top NOTHING like a grilled cheese sandwich) and Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip cookies which we were told that they do not make until after 4pm (we went for lunch). Earth to Sweet Tomatoes people like to eat cookies before 4pm too!!!',2
'These tacos gave me a boner',5
'Good spot for brunch but over priced',3
'Came here for dinner about a week ago. Everything on the menu looks really good and we decided to share a medallion pizza as it sounded pretty delish. Nothing was remarkable about the pizza. I couldnt tell you if everything listed on the menu actually made it onto the pizza. Its a cute place and the folks behind the counter were great. I may stop by if Im in the area but I probably wouldnt go out of my way to get back here.',3
'When a place is done RIGHT they get 5 stars! FP is about a 4 star place but there are several things that give them that bonus star...  1. They have giant framed artwork yes - with glass. As a photographer - I know what that costs so anyone willing to spend $$ on glass that big gets a thumbs up. 2. They have cool brass sculptures and other assorted Chinese decorations. 3. They have DUCK! Its Crispy Duck not Peking - but NOBODY in Phx has Peking Duck right? Whatever...they have duck and it was served up nice and crisp with a hint of 5 spice. It wasnt even a problem that we were the first people in the doors at Noon (thats when they open on Sundays. Double Bonus Points.) 4. They DO Mu Shu. Note: I didnt say they HAVE Mu Shu. The server does it old school and stuffs your pancakes right their tableside with chopsticks. BAM. TRIPLE BONUS POINTS. 5. They have old-school cocktails on the menu...like a Singapore Sling and Zombies. We didnt partake but its cool that they have em!  The food is good the menu offers just about every variation of everything - chicken pork beef lobster scallops...however you want them...spicy hot/sour cashews almonds...whatever.   Prices are pretty good (really good if you hit it weekdays for lunch special - and lunch special includes General Tsos Chicken for fans of that! Thats pretty rare. If I was a Tso fan Id double bonus point that - but as you can tell - Im a duck fan: so only single bonus points there.  The hot tea was fresh and tasty. The servers are friendly the food is quickly prepared. Even the takeout menu is really nice! Good glossy paper stock nice graphic design with flamingos watermarked into it. Well written good layout.   There you have it. Five freakin stars baby count em. Attention to detail matters restauranteurs! Brings you up a star in my book and I know it counts with other Yelpers!',5
'They are open again!  The green chili soup is delicious and is like playing Russian Roulette.  Sometimes its super spicy sometimes its manageable.  Pork Adovada is the standard here.  What I like is that you can also order off of the Rokerij menu and the wine menu is exactly the same which is nice.  They have a great patio which you should take advantage of if you can.  Im still annoyed that they cant just give you a chile relleno a la carte you have to get the entire plate.  These are the quirks that you deal with when you come here.   The service is friendly and yes the prices are still a dollar or two too high but then again it looks exactly like the old restaurant so the same gripes and same good stuff are all there.',4
'Went to Matts Big Breakfast before our morning flight out of PHX airport after seeing reviews here.   We were lucky to find them open on Monday since they were not open Mondays in the past.  There was no wait for our party of two and were promptly greeted and informed of the daily special.  The waitress was very nice and attentive.   I had the special which was a three egg scramble with canadian bacon and locally grown asparagus along with home fries.  K had the eggs bacon and hash browns.  Both meals came with toast and preserves.  Both the wheat and sourdough toast were thick slices and very fresh.  Everything was  fresh and tasty.  (Total bill $22.)  We will definitely be stopping back here in future trips to the area as it was a delicious meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone although it is so very small that it is a good idea to get there early (they open at 630) seeing as we got there at 730 and by 815 there was a line to sit.',5
'I have incredibly mixed emotions about Del Friscos. My first few brunches (Im a glutton for brunch) were great. I enjoyed the meals and received a hand written note from the bar tender thanking me for coming to the restaurant and commenting on what I ordered. I was initially immediately impressed. My husband and I went for dinner and found the quality lacking and the service very slow. We were disappointed in the food for the price we paid. The last time I went I had chicken and waffles. The waffles were great. The chicken was pieced together mixed meat mash of who knows what. It was not fresh bone-in chicken which is what I expected. I think I ate more batter than meat. I did not enjoy it at all. I saw it was featured recently on Chow Bella as a top 10 Chicken and Waffles. Either Chow Bella has never had proper chicken and waffles or Del Friscos did some serious impressing.  I really want to like the restaurant for the location roof-top bar and overall atmosphere but I just cant do it right now.',2
'XMAS PARTY RUINED BY GRAND LUX!! You would think that making reservations one month in advance would secure our request for our office party. NONONO not the case at the Grand Lux.  The day before our party our reservations-- our reserved table per our request was given to another party.  They told us our reservation was for 10:30am not 6pm(their admitted mistake) wait...they said..we dont open until 11am!!?? WTF??  After speaking to the manager he did offer us some cookies for our trouble. Gee..thanks but no thanks. Oh and they did offer to put us  on some high top tables..too bad two people in our party are in wheelchairs...that is why we requested the booths. Very UPSETTING and DISAPPOINTED in the Grand Lux!!!  Apparently you must call each day to make sure your reservations are secure.  DONT PLAN ANY PARTIES AT THE GRAND LUX',1
'The shaved ice is just a vehicle for artificially-flavored sugar. Its not very good.',2
'One word: Yum.   My co-workers and I took a breather from a crazy day at work and decided to enjoy a relaxing lunch at PastaBAR. All three of us got different pastas and we each tasted each others dishes ... all three were spectacular. I cant wait to go back again!  I enjoyed the Gnocchi alla Lupa...sweet and spicy fennel sausage ragu ... The gnocchi was incredibly fluffy and airy - unlike any gnocchi Ive had before.   My co-workers had Orecchiette con Salsiccia... home-made sausage greens Pecorino ... (very good) and Chitarra alla Amatriciana...guanciale onion parsley hot pepper tomato ... (extra yum! I will likely get this for myself on my next visit).   The place was rather empty for lunch today which I hope is an anomaly.   Its a little on the pricey side for lunch but worth the splurge when youre in the mood for something warm and delicious with a homey touch.',4
'My first Original Pancake House experience was actually not at the Original location.  We would occasionally go the the one in North Phoenix.  In that one all done with bright colors and modern touches - we liked the food but we werent too hip for some of their policies.  So we stopped going - and it appears that was the case with everyone else in North Phoenix too as that funky and cool looking location closed down about 3 years ago or so.    Ive only been to this original location once but found that they seemed a bit less tense on some issues they were more intense on others.  I went during a strong no-cell phone period apparently.  And when work called which means I had to answer several folks gave dirty looks.  While I totally get that folks shouldnt have obnoxious rings and talk loud into their ear pieces while walking through the restaurant that policy seemed to encourage the dirty looks for answering a vibrating phone.  So... I havent been back.    Based on Selbys review I may have to go back one of these days because their food really was great - thus the 4 stars.   But Ill try to make sure its a day when I dont expect to get any calls.',4
'Wonderful place! Tuscan atmosphere delicious food! They use a European coffee press and I am not exaggerating  best coffee in the valley!',5
'The second time I went back to this restaurant was peculiar.  The waitress started out clingy and constantly complimenting my friend then she became very pushy about wanting us to leave.  She brought our check with 2 fortune cookies on top came back 2 minutes later then tossed the cookies onto the table and wiggled the check at us.  I was willing to write off this occasion since my first was so good.  I went back for a 3rd try and actually had to walk out because the service was so bad.    Our group of 4 came in and said that we needed a table for 4.  The hostess showed us to a table with only 3 seats at it then looked confused when we pointed out that we needed another chair.  She then showed us to another table with 3 seats then started to walk away.  When we got her attention to point out that 3 seats are never adequate for 4 people regardless which side of the room it is on she told us to go wait in line again.    Technically there was no line but we went back up to the front to wait for a 4th chair at either table.  While we were waiting for them to get their sh!t together I noticed that the hostess was grabbing chairs from all over the restaurant and putting it at a table that did not have all of their dining partners.  Im no restaurant owner but it seems to me that it would be more important to seat people WHO ARE ACTUALLY THERE!  My blood was starting to boil but we were seated and I was willing to forgive.  We had our menus and we were ready to order but we waited and waited.  I think it was 15 minutes before the waitress (the weird clingy one from my second trip) came to our table we had no drinks no nothing.  We realized how much time we were wasting and discussed getting our food to go before the waitress finally appeared at our table.  When we mentioned getting our food to go she gave us THE NASTIEST LOOK then told us that we would have to go tell the hostess what we wanted.  I lost it.  I told the waitress that everything that we had experienced thus far was completely unacceptable and I wouldnt tolerate it.  I stood up to leave and she stood where she was (in my way) ignored me and tried to take my dining companions orders.  She finally backed off without even a glimmer of apology after my companions realized that I really was leaving.   I will not go back here ever again no food is worth this treatment.',2
'I had the parmesan encrusted chicken and Ive never been disappointed.  I love their mashed potatoes and their broccoli ir has this lemon-y flavor which isnt typically done.   The service here is always very good I have never left here disappointed. Their house beers are so very good if your over the age of 21 and would like to try something different I would say definitely to for it. Almost forgot to mention their Italian sodas are gooood!   Its almost always very busy so I would try to call ahead and check in.',5
'This place makes me crazy. I would really want to love it here. Close to my house good beer on draft good salads good pizza. (Too small for my boyfriend; hes not coming back.) I NEVER get greeted quickly here. I sat at the bar for 10? minutes at lunchtime. and at least 3 people walked by. They must have seen me; its like they avoid making eye contact and wont offer a glass of water until they have time. This has happened every time Ive been there. Once we were seated the service improved but I had to go from irate to barely satisfied.',2
'Yet another one of Sam Foxs great restaurants.  I would have gave a fourth star but I do not think the staff is equipped enough to handle the large crowds.  Since this place has an indoor relaxing vibe and the outdoor is a hangout athletic patio there is alot going on and to handle with one kitchen.  I have been here multiple times now and not once was the server on top of their game.    Food is great here always high expectations from any of his restaurants.  This is a great spot to hang out with friends after work and it is my new favorite place for dinner drinks and outdoor games!  They have a great variety with shuffle board ping pong and some others.  It is hard to come and play outdoors in the peak of the heat so wait until it cools down.    I love the grilled artichokes here I am sucker every time.  Great salads too.  I plan to try some other entrees the next time I come and enjoy!',3
'Really enjoyed the lunch combo of pizza and salad. We all had different pizzas but I liked the meatball the best. The ranch dressing on the salad was great. Seemed homemade.',5
'Tried this place for the first time the other day since I was really craving some Chinese food. Since this place was fairly close to me I decided to give it a try. Im all for supporting small businesses but I really wasnt a fan of my food. I ordered the general tso chicken combination plate. It came with 2 wonton crisps an egg roll and your choice of white or fried rice. (All for a very good price). They also throw in homemade sweet & sour sauce soy sauce packets and a fortune cookie (of course!). I felt like a grease ball after eating the chicken (smothered in sauce). The egg roll was very bland and super dry on the inside and the fried wontons were just OK. The ONLY thing I actually enjoyed was the fried rice. It tasted pretty good surprisingly!! However I felt that it lacked the eggs and peas. I had about 3 peas in my 2 scoops of rice. I might go back here again when im craving chinese---only for the fried rice though!',3
'I dont know if I went to the wrong Taqueria Durango but the map on this Yelp posting is different than the address and I went to the address...  TD is not a bad place to grab a few $1 tacos - the pollo was incredibly seasoned and the steak (asada) wasnt bad either.  I was a bit confused as the menu was as Gringo as Ive ever seen in a strip mall taco shop but was surprised by the quality.  The salsa bar off to the side is a plus as well.  There arent a ton of options in the area so if youre stuck in the Hardy and Broadway district give it a shot and support some local business action!',3
'Yummy. Not much else to say. I enjoy supporting the other guys and when they actually deliver on my expectations its always delightful ;)   The service here is always great too.  Dont forget your punch card! I seem to have 4 of them started with 2 punches each...',4
'The Fried Pickles and Chili Cheese Fries were amazing and my burger was great.  I would totally recommend this place to a friend.',4
'It was an OK sandwich.  The quality of the meat was very good.  The bread sort of became non existent before I was done.  The cole slaw was decent.  My friend got excited about some hard to find items she saw in their deli case.  If you are local it would be a good choice for a sandwich but not a trip across town.',3
'Another great new location from the Corieris creators of Axis/Radius Suede Lounge Myst Sandbar and for those who remember Jetz and Stixx.  RnR is located in a brand new building on the South edge of Oldtown Scottsdale and right across the street from the former Billet Bar (I dont know its new name). The atmosphere is your typical Scottsdale eatery/sports bar. Big flatscreen TVs large bar and lots of attractive people in designer jeans. Theres both indoor and outdoor seating and its definitely a place to start the night before heading out for the Scottsdale club scene.  The service was quick and very good. I had the sirloin steak sandwich with sweet potato fries while others in my party tried various burgers and salads. My sandwich was excellent and others enjoyed their food as well. The fries are served in a small bucket and reminded me of the ones at Delux Burger.  The only reason RnR loses a star is that once the football game ended the music was turned up so loud that it was practically impossible to hear the people at my own table.   I can see turning up the music later in the evening but we were there on Sunday night and the NFL playoff game ended at about 6:00 which still strikes me as the dinner hour and it was disconcerting to have the music get so loud so early.',4
'Smart Gym has lots of new state of the art equipment. Ive tried several of the group fitness classes which have been fun and challenging. Ive found the fitness instructors to be first rate. Its very clean there are members of all ages and the monthly rate is very affordable. Im a newer member and am very impressed!',5
'How else would you start a mini vacation in the Phoenix area.  Well of course stop off at The Tilted Kilt for a quick drink and a few ok appetizers. Potatoe skins and wings beer and booze.   Service was great.  It was not too busy but it was kinda late.  Would I go back well only if I have to.',3
'Not the worst subway experience.  Not the best.',3
'Restaurant week review...so we have not eaten here for dinner previously so we cannot comment on the RW menu and food vs the normal menu however nothing we had would lure us back.  Atmosphere is nice and pleasant however the open floor plan makes it a bit noisy. Food seemed reasonably priced and portions were sufficient. Service was excellent.   Food: For starters we had the soup which had a good consistency but lacking. It was too sweet and not enough earthy flavors. The shrimp was decent but nothing special.  For entrees we had the shepherds pie which was was not thick enough  bland and not even as good as the one you can get at Costco. The crispy whitefish over dirty rice was tasty but lacking a nice sauce to help the overall dry consistency of the dish. Someone else at the table had the pulled pork and said it was good but not great.  The best part of our meals were the desserts chocolate covered bacon smores and coconut cake. Both would be worthy closers to a nice meal.',3
'I was a little embarrassed to admit to my co-workers that I REALLY wanted to eat lunch at Nordstrom Cafe! To my surprise they were equally as delighted and it was a nicer alternative to the hum drum food court experience.   The cafe is located on the third floor of Nordstroms right next to the young womens clothing department. I adore Nordstrom Cafe in my hometown of Honolulu and was very happy to see that the quality was right on par. I always order the angel hair pasta with spicy shrimp and it was EXACTLY what I expected. I always request that there be no spice added and they were more than happy to accomodate! Move over McDonalds because Nordies has got the duplication process down to another level!   (Photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-nordstrom-scottsdale?select=8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g#8KOO0n8EuWaUWGK_Ha4Z3g)  Although the restaurant was smaller than I expected service was wonderful food was delicious and the only thing which went wrong was they got my friends order mixed-up. But of course in true Nordstrom Cafe fashion they apologized profusely and fixed it right away. You are my cafeteria style home away from home Nordstrom Cafe!!!  31 Yelps Challenge: #10/31',4
'Pool is in major need of renovation! Bugs everywhere in pool too. Very filthy.',3
'Ive eaten Vietnamese food all over the valley and this place is by far my favorite. Particularly the BÚN BÒ HUE ~ Spicy Beef Soup.  It is hands-down the best version of this I have ever had. The broth is so flavorful I dream about it. It is incredibly complex and its hard to pinpoint what flavors are in there but you wont care youll be too busy eating the bathtub sized bowl of heaven.   Also amazing are the grilled meats especially the shrimp. They have a delicious sauce on them and taste smokey from the grill. Awesome on the rice platter or in the roll your own spring rolls (a very light and healthy way to enjoy Vietnamese!)  Also of note are the rice flower crepe (allow a few extra minutes for this one if you are in a lunch rush) and the fantastic creamy curry (chicken beef shrimp or tofu). The entree comes with rice BUT if you order it off the sandwich menu youll get a smaller portion (the regular is huge) surrounded by warm crusty french bread. To. Die. For. Not spicy but full of flavor and the creamy taste of coconut milk.  They can get pretty busy at times and occasionally the service is a bit slow waiting to check out etc but not always and its worth the wait. Just ask for your check a little early and dont be afraid to flag down a server. They are all VERY friendly.',5
'I agree with Roland and Karl hey its Dairy Queen! What can you say about it? We were in the area and wanted a little sweet treat after dinner. I cant remember the last time Ive been to a DQ. Maybe 6 years ago? I love that they have a mini blizzard size. I got the mint oreo and my husband got the pumpkin pie. Yum!',4
'If you pay $35 per night you can get better place in Phoneix  It was stated that this place will provice room cleaning service every 7 days. I stayed there for 11 nights and nobody cleaned my room. I asked everyday at front desk after 7 nights fornt person said I will put you on tomorrow but they were not truthfull. Replacement towel I got in exchange of my used one had lingering smell of cat urine.',1
'In spite of the Malayan curse and being a victim of an untimely conflagration in its building this gem is officially reborn and doing wonderful things once again!  As many of you know Ranch House re-opened its doors last Monday and today Peggy and I had the absolute pleasure of having breakfast there. The food is superb as always and the service is excellent.  Chicken-fried steak (either with cream gravy or with green pork chili) is wonderfully favorable and not just breading. The burritos are always top notch.  It is a pleasure to welcome back this neighborhood place!',5
'I have now been to Vals twice.  My friend Nancy is in love with Vals and talks about it constantly so when I was out on her side of town I went to dinner with her.  Val is amazing.  She is super friendly and is the main reason I am giving Vals a 4.  The food is good but from what Ive seen the menu doesnt really exist.  She has food that is prepared and if you get what is available it is quite good.  The mashed potatoes and tuna salad is amazing.  I understand this is not really a meal but they are both delicious.  I dont know that I am dying to go back but if it was suggested I wouldnt run away.',4
'One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants Ive been to here in Phoenix. I would have given it a 5 star if it wasnt for the fact that they dont turn on the ac or they set it way too high when the owner is there.',4
'Happened to go into Barros tonight because it was next to Target and SuperCuts and the kids were hungry so pizza it is!  This location used to be Godfathers Pizza and they have done a complete overhauls. New tables booths dark wood furniture tile the works. It looks nice but its also comfortable for the family.  The staff was very pleasant and helpful so all in all a nice place to go in for dinner with the family.  Tonight we had hot wings which were pretty good. Not the best Ive had and far from the worse just good.  The hubs and I ordered a small BBQ Chicken pizza to share and then two french bread pizza stick kids meals for our rugrats. My kids are both big pizza eaters but one kids meal would have sufficed. The french bread pizza sticks were a foot long...definitely big enough for my 5 and 2 year old to share.   The BBQ pizza was  delicious except for maybe a touch too much BBQ  sauce..I would request light sauce next time. The crust was puffy and yummy.  Definitely a place wed go back to.  Oh and if you want to go get take out then you can order a nice cold beer on tap and watch a game while you wait. :)',4
'What a great store for my pets!  I went here recently as my dog covered himself in mud at the dog park and I was heading to a friends house for BBQ - cant bring a muddy dog along! I did the least expensive self-wash at $13. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful here and set me up quickly. Everything about the place makes it easy to wash your dog.  The selection of toys is great and of course they have their own freshly baked snacks for your pups. Ill be coming back in soon.',5
'Good food and freindly staff. They have a nice selection on the menu. After seeing the table next to me I wish Id of had the house specialty....blueberry pancakes. Next time........',4
'Wow we just checked in today and we were overwhelmed by the Valet the bellmen and especially Amanda the person in charge of check-in. She put our whole family next to one another and treated us incredibly well. We made reservations on hotwire so I thought the customer service was even more impressive.  The pools are incredible for a family or for adults as theres an adult only pool. BTW-there are waterslides as well.  The service at the pool was also casual but very thorough. The bartender inside has been super cool as well. We just ordered scrambled eggs at 7 at night and he didnt miss a beat. Just a very cool spot. It was a last minute booking for us through hotwire so we couldnt have been more please to drive up and be treated so well. ;)',5
'I love the food at Fatburger I just dont love this particular location. They always close ridiculously early and the times on the website are different than the ones here listed on Yelp: Operating Hours: Sun-Thu: 11am-8pm | Fri-Sat: 11am-10pm. Ive been in this location at 7:30pm and seen customers turned away around 7:45pm being told that they were already closed.  I recently went there on a Friday night at 9:30pm and almost all of the chairs in the restaurant had already been put on top of tables and employees were already walking out. My party and I ordered food and found a place to sit and I was enjoying my meal... until I found a long dark hair wrapped around one of my fries. I asked for a refund on my fries and was given one yet without any apology.   Even though this location is closest to me I only was able to visit a few times since they always closed too early and now I will never go back that Ive found hair in my food. Find a cleaner Fatburger where employees care about quality and arent rushing to get out of there.',1
'My bestie and I stopped in last night for sushi after partying it up on a school night in Old Town for Halloween. I love that Geisha is open late. Sushi seems to taste even better when hungry and I had gone out without eating first. Geisha wasnt crowded when we arrived and we sat at the bar to eat.  I rarely...almost never eat fried food but I craved a Vegas roll. Geisha doesnt have a Vegas roll (say what?!) so the bartender told me to order the Philly roll and to write Vegas roll next to it. My bestie ordered the sashimi platter. Both orders arrived quickly. I bit into my roll with eager anticipation but was surprised/turned off by the bacon grease flavor. ewww. I tolerated it because I didnt want the drama but hungrily eyed the nearby sashimi platter with drooling mouth.   Lesson learned. Dont order a Vegas roll at geisha...get the sashimi platter.  I enjoyed eyeing all of the Halloween costumes as we dined and chatted. Geisha might become an after party destination from now on but not for a Vegas roll or anything fried.',4
'Well since this Dollar Tree is within walking distance of my apt. I am definitely a fan. I always go here when I need my movie candy fix....whenever I am heading to the drive-in. I mean dozens of choices of all your favorite candy for a buck....cant really beat that. Not to mention you get the huge and family sizes for that price as well....and generally the customer service is always good. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends!!!',4
'Fresh & Easy surprised me.  They dont have the biggest selection but what they do have is well thought out and very well priced.  It would seem that FE caters to single person/ small family households which is great.  Their premade food is tasty and the soups are awesome.  I am constantly shocked at how cheap meat is here.  My freezer is stocked full of chops and chicken at about half the cost of what I would pay elsewhere.  You cant get all your shopping done at FE but its an enjoyable experience and the stuff you can get is top notch and bottom dollar.  Im a fan',4
'Yep I heart LGO too. I have been know to drive from Tempe to satisfy my ceasar salad craving. Theirs really is the best Ive had. Also the tasty morsels they have in the front glass case are a huge hit wherever I bring them. The cupcakes from Tammie Coe (best birthday cakes .......also does wedding cakes etc and can make them look like your favorite Chanel bag or Jimmy Choos ...(WHO CAN DO IT? Tammie CAN!!) My boyfriend said that Tammie Coe is the only woman hed leave me for.....not Jessica Alba or Gisele. (Maybe I should write a separate review of Tammie Coe Cakes) Anyway LGO staffers always efficient friendly and willing to make your day!',5
'I have never had a dissapointing meal here.  Their protein pancakes alone make this place 5 stars (not really but you get the point that they are THAT good).  I usually go here 1-2 a month and can honestly say I have not had bad service or food.',5
'The first time I heard about the vegan options it sounded too good to be true... a real Italian restaurant with vegan choices? Well this place just keeps getting better. I have always loved their vegan calzone and their vegan baked ziti but recently they actually added a whole separate vegan menu with extra vegan options and the last time I was there the wait staff told me (or rather they told my omnivore mother who is much less shy and much more talkative than I am) that the owner was so pleased with how well the vegan menu was doing that they were planning on adding even more options in the near future.  So far I have had (that I can remember) the vegan calzone the vegan baked ziti the veggieballs the hot veggie sandwich with vegan cheese and the angel bites. If you ask they will also make you vegan garlic bread although I dont believe thats actually on the menu yet. All of it is great although the angel bites could have been a little bit sweeter or more interesting considering thats their only vegan dessert option so far.  Also the vegan calzones make for great leftovers especially if you ask for a little to-go container for the sauce as well so you can dip it. I have done this multiple times.',5
'This place is a cool little independent place to find great stuff. They have a lot of products collars toys food etc. all of it hip and/or healthy. It is a little pricey but like they say you get what you pay for. The people are wonderful. We frequent the Wag N Wash for not just bathing our dogs but for their food toys etc. It is well worth a visit and you will see why people come back again and again.',4
'Food here is excellent my favorite is the shrimp po boy. If you like good southern food this is the place to go! I have eaten here many times over the last few years and have NO complaints!!!',5
'This is a Happy Hour review for this location. I have only eaten dinner at the downtown Austin location.  This is my Arizona friends favorite happy hour spot. The few times he is up for a happy hour we go here. The happy hour is confined to the bar area (saloon) and the patio. Be cautious of the wait for the indoor seating. The Roaring Fork happy hour is not a secret. Try the patio you will usually have better luck getting a seat.  My friend only gets one thing: the Big Ass Burger cooked medium rare. He loves it. The Longhorn cheddar the bacon and especially the poblano pepper. He is a little disappointed that over the years the Big Ass Burger has gone from one pound of meat to two-thirds of a pound. However this fact does not stop him from devouring the burger. Five stars for the burger.  We split the guac and chips. The guacamole is wonderful and I love the presentation. For me this appetizer is totally worth $6.   I usually munch on the friends fries and drink my mojitos as there are not very many vegetarian options at Roaring Fork. The mojito is decent and the margarita is good too. Ill have to try the Huckleberry marg next time. (I hear its great!)  All in all a great happy hour location. Especially since its 4-7 daily.',4
'Oh how I wish these were in California!!!  I visit my best friend in AZ a couple times a year and everytime Im there I beg her to take me to Pita Jungle.  I have to say the one in Chandler is my all time the favorite.  The atmosphere is hip the service is awesome and the outside area backs up to a lake.  It so nice and peaceful to sit outside watch the ducks and eat their cilantro jalapeno hummus!  Everything Ive had at this place is delicious.  The gyros are made with just the right amount of tzazkiki sauce the hummus is smooth and creamy and EVERY flavor is a must try.  I tried the mediterranean chicken salad just this last weekend and my taste buds were in heaven!  So lemo juice feta and pine nuts took the salad over the top.  Now if we could only convince the owners to branch out to California say Westlake or Thousand Oaks area I bet these would take off.  With all us health food nuts out here we would appreciate the good food!  :)',5
'Weve been here quite a few times and its a pretty good location. Id say its about the same as all of the other locations Ive been to though... nothing special but its nothing worse either.  The only complaint Ive had is that their iced tea doesnt seem that good here. Im a tea snob though as I love all types of tea hot and cold. Could just be me... but the same flavours at other locations seemed to taste better and this has been several occasions that Ive noticed.  Also as for the changes at Paradise that is happening at all locations... another company bought them out and are changing things slowly but surely. Oh and I still dont like their cookies.... and I love cookies! I just have never liked Paradise cookies for some reason even though everyone always claims how delicious they are :P',4
'When I saw they had Fattoush I had to run right over.  I havent had a Fattoush salad since I move to Phoenix.  Well.... the salad was good but it wasnt the Fattoush Im used to. Instead of fresh parsley sumac and purslane there was dried parsley no sumac or purslane and instead of toasted fresh pita there were very hard croutons.  Dont get me wrong the salad was still good but not the fattoush Im used to.  My quest for the fattoush I remember continues.  I will return to try their schwarmae and they have a nice little middle eastern grocery as well.',3
'The burgers were really good one of the best Ive had. They grind their own hamburger meat and you can definitely tell. Their fries are delicious and I had a chocolate chili shake that was really good too. Were pretty new to Phoenix and this place will definitely be someplace we go again and tell people about',5
'I really am a fan of conveyor sushi. Being able to get my raw fish fix and be stuffed in the $20 range just isnt something I can do at a real sushi house. And it is nice to have small plates for the ability to have a wider sampling of rolls and nigiri. Seaweed salad tai (red snapper) tuna salmon several rolls and the deep fried jalapenos (not authentic...but SO yummy!) and an iced green tea. Stuffed for the rest of the day and didnt break the budget. Gotta love that! Ive been to this location a couple of times - my house is just about mid-point between here and Teharu in Chandler - and Ill continue to alternate between the two. Granted its not the best sushi around. Fresh but not the super top notch quality Ive been spoiled with. Given the volume it cant help but be corporate in assembly and have a general cafeteria feel.',4
'Have been here a few times and always thought it was a nice place to hang out until other places got going.  Its layed back nice patio off of Scottsdale Rd open bar to the outside good bartenders and waitresses and so on.  This time just had a drink and spent an hour or so there.  It was busy on a Saturday which isnt out of the ordinary and overall enjoyed the experience.  I never considered it one of my favorites but it is a good solid place.',3
'We were fortunate enough to have a great friend who knows her stuff. We met Maureen at the Hula Tiki Grill for a fun lunch.  The weather was perfect outside so we sat underneath a half shade half pre-summer bliss. We all ordered Mai Tais and they were amazing.   We ordered taco plates my guy got the chile chicken and I got the spicy shrimp and we shared one each. We are fans of trying errythang. Mo also ordered the chile chicken which was made with a fresh green chile salsa mild yet flavorful.   We stayed there for hours drinking Mai Tais and Kona beers like we were on a beach somewhere yet out in the heat. We had an amazing time with great service that I wont forget. Thank you Hulas.',5
'We just moved into this area and have eaten here on many occasionsand have had food delivered to my home on a few occasions as well.  Generally speaking the food is ok to good seems pretty fresh the bread is great so with that said we are squally pretty happy.  On this occasion I had approximately 20 people at our home for a town hall type meeting with the other home owners in our neighborhood.  After little debate it was decided that we would just order sandwiches from JJs and ave them delivered.  I call this location.  When the phone was answered n the greeting was yellow please hold.  I had it on speaker and most of the group began to laugh believing it was a terrible way to answer the phone being most of the people here were either business owners or middle to upper level managers.  Five plus minutes past before the person came on the line and asked what can I help you with?  I informed her that I wanted to place an order to be delivered.      She stated  ok what is your address?  I gave it to her and she then asked what do you need I am very busy. At this point one member of our party stated she is very Rude and that we should just go to subway everyone pretty much disagreed and I began to order.  I started to order one of the 18 sandwiches and 2 lettuce wraps when I finished she seemed very disturbed and ask if I remembered that she said that she was very busy.  I replied with a yes and asked if I could get a total please?  She then stated that she was not sure she could fill this order because of its size.  I then stated that t would be no different than if 20 people came in and ordered 20 sandwiches individually.  She than gave me my total and asked for my phone number and my cross streets.  I told her and she then stated that I just wasted her time because that they dont deliver to my address any longer and swore Nader her breath but loud enough for the group to hear her over the speaker of my phone.  Please note that I live just south of cactus as does everyone of the group at my home this evening.  Note:  t is just over one mile to my home.  most people in our group have had food delivered to our homes from JJs in the past.  Well needless to say the group  went to Subway to get our sandwiches.  Oh and the girl on the Phone stated her name was Jayme and that she was the manager when I asked to speak to the Manager.',1
'Wow what a disappointment!   First... Im not a beer/sports nut so big downside there. I was impressed by their beer selection & prices seemed very reasonable.  The wings... you call yourself a wing place and serve up this slop??? It tasted like a bag of wings from the freezer section at Frys!  Yea the sauces have an ok variety but it mostly seems to boost up the male testosterone by how hot you can order.  No presentation of food mediocre service uninspiring corporate wings... all in all my impression was some corporate accountant put these places together... not a foodie.  VERY limited bar if you dont go for beer.',1
'I have been here for brunch and dinner and prefer the brunch.  Service is alwys great and the food is fresh and creative.',5
'Based on the reviews went here for Lunch they had Buffet with one Meat and 3-4 vegetarian dishes for around $10.  Tried palak paneer but the paneer(cheese) itself  was missing the dish it was like having chicken curry without chicken. Long story short the food lacked the taste that you find in good Indian cuisine...',1
'I Highly reccomed Mad Hatter!! I had an exhaust leak in an older car and called these guys. I expected a lenghthy diagnosis and repair but I was in and out within 15 minutes. In todays day and age its nice to find a shop that is honest and reasonable!!',5
'I LOVE that happy hour is until 9:00 which makes it nice for the people that cant get off work at 5:00. Serivce could be much quicker.   I really liked the ambiance in Mabels and the coward of people it draws it great. Its a fun place to hang out.',4
'3 Taquitos - a little over priced but excellent.   Bombero Burrito - Spicy! Super good.   Al Pastor Burrito - ask for no beans and add cilantro and onion. Very good.   Overall this place has great food but not quite as good as a San Diego Taco Shop and the portions are a bit on the small side for the prices.',4
'Awesome restaurant! Everyone working there were very friendly and fun to be around. The food was delicious. We will definitely visit again!',5
'The food is always fresh and tastes great. I really enjoy coming in for lunch in between work and my appointments. I can order an entree soup wonton and spring roll for less than $7 during lunch time. Kung Pao chicken and the sweet and sour shrimp are great. Yes this is slightly americanized but it has been in business for quite some time and the staff and owners are always friendly. They do not hesitate to remember your face and say hello. This is by far my favorite place to take a friend for a quick bite to eat if we want chinese.',5
'Great menu selection food is hot and fresh and you cant beat the prices!',4
'When in Phoenix one expects a lot of tacos chile rellenos burritos and the like.  Padres puts an extra special spin on the standards and then some!    Starters -- chips and salsa?  Hell no!  Granted I had to talk my table into the Cilantro Mousse but yes the lil serving bowl was licked clean by the time the Cazuela de Queso Fundido came.  Melted cheese is always fun.    Enchiladas.  Standard Mexican fare.  BUT at Padres they serve it up with salmon and spinach.  Tacos.  Standard.  BUT with Duck...amazing!      Pedros puts a spin on a standard favorite but nobody was complaining one bit.',4
'My husband and I go here every Saturday morning and it is the highlight of our week - like a mini-date every seven days. The food is excellent and the owner and staff are friendly. Its a tad pricey but the food is top-quality - always fresh and much is locally grown.',5
'Ill be quite honest I choose Hannys time & time again b/c its one of the most low-key yet sophisticated places to get together with a large group of friends. Great music superior comfort & wonderful cocktails.  The interior architecture makes me swoon... the triple laminated glass floor in the elevator shaft is particularly exciting after a few Moscow Mules. I love how the unisex restrooms are tucked away and create an Alice & Wonderland effect of which door should I go through contemplation. The long lazy chaise lounges remind me of a giant cows tongue. They are an amazing place to spread out after dinner & continue the conversation.  In fact you can even eat there if youd like.  That brings me to the food. The food is good & reasonably priced. The portions generous & easy to share.  However they will never win any awards or get anyone excited by their offerings. If youre looking for something to awaken your taste-buds then you might want to reserve this place for an evening where food isnt the main ingredient.',4
'Good food- but over priced! For the price I expect more food to be on my plate. Cant go wrong with the pizzas and pastas.',3
'Blimpies makes a good sandwich.  This was the first sub chain I ever ate in back when I was in college.  Then it was either Blimpie or Subways.  I will not give in to temptation to list all the choices available today and within driving distance of this location but obviously times have changed.  I come here twice a month usually when I have coupons which might tell you something.  The Blimpies Best is their tastiest and includes: ham salami cappacola prosciuttini provolone along with veggies.  Other Blimpie subs are: Roast Beef and Provolone Ham and Swiss and The Club.  Ive tried them all over the years but continue to come back to their BB.  Now the question youve been waiting for are they better then Subways.  Well at times yes.    Are they better then Jimmy Johns Jersey Miles Capriottis or Quiznos etc.  No!',3
'Lux is a great place to have a cup of Java and work on your lap top. Centrally located right off the light rail Lux is a great location. It is always happening. Lux is funky and inviting. The walls are feature ecclectic artwork and the music is great.',4
'They promised they would have my car fixed in under 30 days from massive hail damage.  Instead they had it for 45 days.  I had to pay for two weeks of car rental out of pocket because they took so long then it wasnt fixed right and I finally had to have my insurance agent step in to force them to do the job right.  Very unprofessional and I will never bring them my business again.',1
'Heres the scoop if you dont know Ulta: its a Total. Chick. Store.  Find hair products (shampoos conditioners styling) tools (irons curlers dryers headbands bows clips) makeup (all kinds) lotions sunscreens shower soaps facial skincare and a salon. They carry some high-end stuff but not everything e.g. no Christian Dior bumble & bumble...  Ive been shopping at Ulta for years and in several different cities...this isnt the best Ulta Ive ever been in but they usually have what I want.  The most obvious (and irritating) difference at this location is that the employees dont give you your current rewards points total at the time of your transaction nor do they ask if youd like to redeem them to get your purchase discounted (sometimes by a LOT depending on how many points youve accumulated).   Parking is another issue for this location... Ulta is smack between an Old Navy and a Michaels craft store and in the same vicinity as a Best Buy Marshalls Staples and Last Chance.  Id be better off -- in more ways than one -- to hop my mountain bike up here.   I ordered a couple things from Ulta.com and had them delivered home over the holidays...may have to start doing that more often.',3
'Joya Spa: My little piece of heaven in the middle of the desert...Im so glad I found this spa. It keeps me sane and it keeps my guests sane when they come to visit me. The spa is beautiful and peaceful and clean and decorated with style beyond words. I love the rooftop pool facing Camelback mountain. Usually Im climbing Camelback huffing and puffing all the way up so its definitely good to be lazy and take it in from afar ;) Its so relaxing to lay out  by the pool before a treatment and soak up the sun. Ive tried their massages and facials and mani/pedis. My favorite treatment so far has been an amazing facial I had with Hannah. My skin felt and looked amazing for a good month after the treatment. She was so patient and detailed and I loved how clean my face felt afterwards. I seriously felt like a new woman!   The facilities are definitely incredible: great hamum steam room dry sauna hot tub and my favorite: the cold shower...Absolutely invigorating! The coed relaxation lounge is really wonderful if you want to have a spa day with your special someone!   Usually I take my out of town guests or local friends there for their bdays: we make a day out of enjoying the spa and spend a good couple of hours there; getting a treatment hanging out at the pool using the facilities and taking a relaxing nap in the relaxation lounge. Finally we take a shower and get ready in the womens lounge which has everything you need to get ready. Then we head out to dinner in Scottsdale. And a great time is had by all! =)',5
'I was seen here on a Saturday afternoon. The visit was quick I was in and out the door in under an hour. the doctor who I saw was absolutely amazing understanding and and attentive!  Ill definitely be using only this urgent care in the future.',5
'This place was a mad house! I stood in line for 20m minutes then finally gave up.. will try again later! However the food that was coming out of the kitchen looked and smelled amazing!',3
'A hip Japanese restaurant with a wide range of selections form ravioli to sushi to steak.  Unique interpretations of often offered selections.  One of the better restaurants in the Valley.  Bring your credit card.',5
'One of my favorite Mexican places to eat in Phoenix.  this is definitely a lunch place (and very busy)... the exterior has been upgraded recently so it looks kinda nicer...  the atmosphere is different.  you order your food from a window and wait for your number to be called... all seating is on your own and at times it is though to get a seat...  despite all of this the food is excellent and cheap.  If you go you should buy the tortillas to take home... they are HUGE and pretty tasty... the walls are plastered with awards for best tortillas in Phoenix...  I also recommend trying the tacos and burros...',5
'My best girl friend I met up around 5:30 on a Monday night and waited 35 minutes for a table.  The wait area is small and shaped like a horse-shoe which makes a long wait awkward.  Once we were seated we got a nice big booth gotta love the friendly hellos from the employees.  Mary was our server which she was very sweet and fun.  We started with the white sangria (me) and my friend got the dirty monkey. Both were served in a pint glass which is a big drink for just over $6.  We enjoyed the drinks very much.  We also had the toasted ravioli as an appetizer which was nice and crisp and hot.  For our mains she got the pesto veggie sandwich and I got the o-livo pizza which is basically Mediterranean flavors.  Her sandwich was huge and difficult to manage though a great value.  My pizza was thin crust and honestly a little bland.  Would have enjoyed more kalamata olives maybe? The crust was supposedly a little thicker than the typical but I found it to be blah and definitely not homemade.    Of course the best part is the pizza cookie!! We got half chocolate chip and half peanut butter which was amazing. This was my friends first time trying pizookie and of course she loved it.  Pros: drinks dessert Cons: long wait average pizza',3
'Everything I put in my mouth at Hulas was amazing. Started off with a blood orange margarita tart but loved it. Then The Volcano was delivered to our party of 8. It tasted like jungle juice and served family-style. For dinner I had the pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top and sweet potato fries. I think the fries were my favorite then the coleslaw and the pork last. It was all tasty though. Since it was a friends birthday they brought their signature sundae which was heavenly. Vanilla ice cream with macadamia nuts mixed in topped with toasted coconut and other stuff. Overall pretty stoked with my food choices. Server was awesome until we asked to split the check. She should have asked first! Just a little tude but oh well. Definitely want to go back and try other deliciousness.',4
'Pure Barre is an AMAZING workout. It can change your whole body. Ive seen better results from 3 months of pure barre than I did from 3 months of half marathon training. I am fitting into clothes I havent worn since college and I am down 2 sizes. It is challenging no matter how many times youve been to class. As your form improves the workout challenges you in new ways. The instructors are positive and genuinely nice. They help you with your form and give you personal attention in every class. I would recommend Pure Barre to anyone who is seriously committed to changing their body.',5
'I really enjoy Postino. Its so comfortable and a real class act. Of course the wines are delish the crowd is hip and the food is yum. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is solely because theres practically no reason for me to go here which may be my own damn fault for being a relative homebody given my employment (concierge). I wouldnt go here for an after-shift glass of wine just because I know it will be swamped. And especially if Im alone I will avoid this place. And if Im looking for romance well the packed thing nixes that idea and they dont take reservations. I would suggest this place however for cougars and other single types.',4
'I stopped in at Haiku Grill for the first time today to grab a California Roll and run back to work.  I will say it was very good!!  8 pieces and only $5 plus tax.  It came with wasabi and ginger as they do most anywhere but it also came with edamame which I did not eat because I am a picky patty.  They had what looked like a decent selection of sushi rolls on the menu plus they have teriyaki bowls and tempura items to choose from.  I will definitely be back to try Haiku Grill again.',4
'-Locked cases are to the front of the store. More vintage booths towards the back of the store.  -This place has some new modern furniture.  -There is an upstairs area but Im too lazy to check it out.  -Prices are hit or miss.   -Not my favorite antique shop but a decent one worth visiting when Im in the area.  -Parking is to the east of the building.',4
'Two recent visits for reverse happy hour.  A dining buddy of mine gets off work at 9pm.  Weve been trying various places in Central Phoenix for late food.   Zen 32 was chosen as a plan B a few weeks ago.  We were aiming for Postino on Central...but it was a 45 minute wait when I got there at 9.  Neither of us wanted to stand in the parking lot that long.  So I suggested Zen as an alternative.  I think it may be one of the frequent choices from here on out!  Both visits Kara was our bartender/server.  Friendly fast outgoing an absolute doll!   Reverse Happy Hour starts at 10 - when prices drop from Holy High Batman!  to the perfect place to eat drink and be whoever you care to be for around $20. Well and Draft for $3!  (Draft includes Stella - which makes my dining buddy a very happy camper.) Edamame and Miso for $2 Seaweed or Squid salads for $3.  Basic nigiri for $2-4 Some sashimi $5-6 Select rolls for $3.  Special rolls for $8. Where most places have long forgotten about gratis happy hour munchies - Zen 32 still provides them! On the first visit hot offerings were crab puffs (okay Krab puffs) and onion tempura.  A huge platter or California roll also out for the grazing...oops I mean taking. Last night the crab puffs had been replaced with spring rolls.  Two drinks two rolls and a couple of trips to the buffet table...I was stuffed and my budget was not shattered.  Thank you Kara and thank you Zen 32!  Reverse happy hour here is the perfect place for those of us who love sushi but cant afford a real sushi dinner on a regular basis.',4
'Definitely a sports bar for all around beer lovers.  I was expecting to see more Belgian ales..only one on the menu and was overwhelmed by I P A choices. Fries compete with Four Peaks fries...burgers there need some work as does the buns.  Overall good atmosphere tons of jocks and decent location.  South Chandler simply needs more bars!',4
'Awesome coffee every time. Im really glad they use local rosters and take the time to do it justice. Cant wait for the new shop on Vernon to open.  Love the lemonade- makes me forget its 110.',5
'I stayed here while in Phoenix for work and it was great! The lobby is beautiful - I really enjoyed the rose scented water they offered the service was phenomenal and all in all it is a top-notch hotel.  The pool is small however so I am not sure that it is the best spot for vacationers. The mall is right across the street but it closes very early (7 p.m.) there is a huge movie theater right next door though.',4
'Great food and great service!!!!  As I walked in their establishment I was received with a smile and warm greeting.  Now THATS a PLUS!! Secondly the place was relaxing and quiet. Coming from LOUD New York this was a real treat that it was quiet!  The food presentation was beautiful and the food was quite tasty with fresh herbs you can taste and smell! Mmmm!  NOT greasy or oily or everything but the kitchen sink in your dish.  I highly recommend this place! The decor and seating arrangements are quite comfortable as well. I also received 10% off on my first bill with Yelp.  Definitely will come back when Im back in Phoenix!!',5
'Fast....scrumptious...and great price!! I ordered from here by just picking by name lol...glad I did....from phone convo to delivery it was fast and easy....very poliet staff...i will be ordering again!!',5
'My trip should have been aptly called Beards and Beer instead of the birds n beers.  Apparently I missed out on the typical sex themed talks IE. frog sex bird sex and flower sex.  Since this was the last event of the year visitors got a stand up routine about beards from an official Beardo.  Wildly funny and entertaining stand up the Four Peaks beer might have helped.  Four Peaks provided their main staple beers: Kilt lifter Hop Knot and Kolsch.  3 styles to meet any palate.    Stop by and youll meet their passionate staff and some friendly bird n beer enthusiasts.  Theres no better way to to unwind after work and learn a few things about that nature thing outside.',5
'Had lunch here the other day with my team and the food was great! We started with the super lump Maryland style blue crab cakes and they were unbelievable. Then I had the roast chicken sandwich with provolone cheese bacon and hatch green chiles. It came with a side of macaroni and cheese that was absolutely delicious with bread crumbs on it that gave it an amazing texture. Our server Emily was so nice and it was great to meet the owner Dianne. They are also doing brunch on the weekends. I cant wait to try it!',5
'I live right near this place and had been meaning to stop by; it is always a pleasure to see a new local business pop up. My fiances Vegan sister was in town and we needed to get something quick and tasty after a long day. I took orders and left for my one block journey. When I arrived the two gentleman working greeted me with smiles and took some time to get to know me. Everything looked AMAZING! I told them I needed something vegan and Eddie took it upon himself to create a masterpiece of Mediterranean Vegan friendly meals. They let me sample anything I wanted and I ended up with a wonderful gyro bowl with caramelized egg plant roasted potatoes and so many other yummy things. I would give this place 5 stars for their customer service alone but they have amazing food as well.',5
'Dave is the best Ins guy out there. He always has your best interest and is will to go the extra mile. My engagement ring fell apart (soft stones) in the first yr I had it he made sure I got it fix and took care of EVERYTHING!!!  Go Dave Markus !',5
'Best red velvet cupcake ever! The sugar cookies just melt in your mouth. The fondant work on the cakes is great but I do think they are bit expensive.',4
'I look forward to going to the Sugar Bowl when Im in Scottsdale.  Old time ice cream parlors are a vanishing breed in the US.   There are so few places left where you can get an ice cream soda.  Thats why I really like this place!  There are so many ice cream treats that are not found elsewhere.  Plus as others have pointed out its nice to see a place that has withstood the test of time---especially in a high growth area.  So many places come and go but the Sugar Bowl remains.  Do pay it a visit if you like ice cream!  The service is friendly and prompt.  Just remember---when you are ready to pay you dont pay the server you go to the cash register and pay.',4
'I ordered my first cake from Cupcakes by Design recently and from the moment I walked into their Delcious Smelling Bakery I was in absolute Awe!  I had asked them to put a design on the top that had to do with gaming and I FREAKED when I saw the ENTIRE cake was in the shape of an xbox controller - it was so--- real looking that my 3 year old grandson kept hitting the button on the top of the cake!  It was absolutely DELICIOUS BEAUTIFUL and I literally started crying when I saw it.  I couldnt believe my eyes AND... it was AFFORDABLE and FRESH!  I have been to several bakeries in North Scottsdale and none of them measured up to Cupcakes by Design.  My entire family Loved the experience of the delicious cake!',5
'Inbetween the time I ordered my gelato to the time I licked the bowl clean not one word was exchanged between my friend and I. My mind wasnt thinking about anything other than the fact that  WOW - this is the best gelato I have ever had and Ive had gelato in Italy and France!   We are blessed to have such a gem in Arizona! More people need to find out about this place. I live about 20 minutes away but it is WELL worth the drive.. even for a small bowl.   If I could I would give this place 100 stars!',5
'Great food! Tasted home made and authentic!!',5
'I love DiVitos!  Speedy delivery consist ant delicious Italian!  The baked ziti is my favorite and it comes with a nice salad that is not just iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.  Amin is a great proprietor that always addresses me by name.  I have carry out almost once a week from them.  This is my neighborhood comfort food!',5
'Again this is only my second review that is not an absolute favor of the restaurant but I have to say I was a little better that my Cheeseburger came with Sweet pickles yuck I have never ever ever ordered a burger and had a come with Sweet pickles the waiter did ask me if I wanted relish on my burger and I said yes unknowing that he was sweet relish with Sweet pickles why would you do this to a great burger the only other travesty that they couldve done was to put Miracle whip on it',2
'The food is always consistently great the beer is excellent oatmeal stout!   Ive come on a game day a late night and for lunch. Even with the place being packed the servers and service are always quick and polite. Lunches are a lot of fun because its more relaxed.   Parking is hilarious but there are plenty of spots down the way so a brisk walk will only help you gain an appetite.',4
'I love Hulas! One of my favorite places in downtown Phoenix. I go here often for happy hour and meals. For drinks I prefer the classic Mai Tai but the Longboard beers on draft are good too and friends swear by the Tiki Bastard and Pink Martini. My favorite dishes are the Poke appetizer pork tacos Coco Joes chicken cajun burger either steak (melt in your mouth!) or the rice bowls. The sweet potato fries and mac and cheese are awesome too. Pretty much everything I have eaten here is good and I have had many of the menu items. The service is excellent and friendly to boot and the atmosphere is hip but relaxed and not pretentious. The patio is fabulous when the weather is nice. I have even taken kids to this restaurant and its been great. All around fabulous restaurant and bar!',5
'Quick and very friendly. They have lots of mags and they do a great job of scheduling appointments and following up.',3
'A Target is a Target is a Target but this is a nice clean well laid-out store and relatively convenient (save for nighttime roadwork in the area). I quickly found what I want but was amused to find salespeople actually leaving the departments I strolled into. Id had a long day but I didnt think I was that repulsive! Fortunately the cashier at the front made up for her disappearing coworkers.  Note: Apparently because of its proximity to the Indian reservation this location does not sell alcohol.',3
'Incredible food. Tortilla soup that is legend and the paradillas are amazing. Not much ambience from a strip mall so dont come for the romance just incredible food.',5
'Ive been using this office for years. The office is well run and uses all the newest technology. My glasses are always perfect.',4
'Mido Sushi has a $20 all you can eat Sushi Buffet.   It includes tempura or gyoza sashimi plate and other appetizers.  The options for the Sushi selection is quite wide.    The first thing that was obvious is that the tempura/gyoza sashimi offering is quite large.  Its a full plate of tempura with 5 or 6 vegtables and two shrimp.  The gyoza had five pieces.  The sashimi plate had 5 or 6 different fish with 5 or 6 slices each.    However the taste and quality of the food was just so so.  The tempura was soggy rather than crispy.  The gyoza was oily.  The sashimi plate didnt have a lot of flavor.  I ordered Unagi Albacore and the Mido roll.  All were ok but not must haves.    The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   Although I had left over food there wasnt a charge.  Great place if you are on a budget and starving however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it I would look elsewhere.',3
'LOVE it!',5
'My absolute favorite Mall in the country! The best staff the best shopping and the Tesla Shop is Bad~ass xD',5
'Completely disappointing disgusting experience.  Starting with out house toilets and no way to wash hands.  Cash only business no mention of this on website.  Dirty river with trash beer cans cigarette butts litter everywhere.  Other tubers which where impossible to keep away from because of the river flow where smoking pot drinking beer using foul language and blasting boom boxes.  No decent code of conduct what so ever..  My family and I were not able to escape the obscene behavior.  One star is very generous.  Do not recommend.',1
'Delicious tacos margaritas and guacamole. Very good serving sizes too. Service was good and food came really quickly.',5
'Read the other reviews particularly the one about some dudes brother having been in Italy etc and decided to try it last night.  Garlic bread was nothing special and iced tea was that Gold Peak stuff which is fine for Silvermine Subs but not what youd expect from an allegedly great Italian place. Had the Cannelloni for main dish and it was absolutely bland. Claimed be served in bechamel sauce but it was more like Alfredo.  Waitress was nice but that doesnt make a tasteless $18 dish worth the money or the calories.  Maybe other stuff is better but I seriously question peoples reviews.  If you have a refined palette for genuine Italian food go elsewhere.',1
'Tried this quaint little place for the first time today with the highest of hopes and was not let down. I went mid-morning to get a cup of coffee and something to eat. The lady behind the counter was very gracious and let me sample a piece of dark chocolate with an espresso cream filling. It was exquisite. I then bought a cappuccino wet and a muffin which I believe was cinnamon streusel. Hands the best cappuccino Ive ever had and the muffin was so moist and the streusel added the perfect amount of richness and flavor. Excited to try theyre large variety of coffees and teas as well as theyre breakfast dishes and pastries.',5
'Happy birthday Arik! Fun little little bar a bit cramped in fact but I like the way the bar itself was laid out in a semi-circle with the bartender in the middle.  She did a pretty good job keeping up too given how busy it was the night we were here.  They have a good selection of better beers (Fat Tire was our beverage of choice along w/ Makers Mark for the birthday boy) at entirely reasonable prices.  Everyone enjoyed the DJ of the evening.  All told fun stuff.',4
'AZ 88 has a very chill feel. It reminds you of an upscale bar without the high prices.  The food is good quality bar food.  The place has a good vibe. The house music is provided by a DJ at night.  There is also art work through out the restaurant.  Fun place!',5
'The prices are high (even with sales and coupons) but the selection is great. Im used to being at the whim of whichever store I buy from when it comes to sizing. Here? I can get as much as I want but the prices will get you.  The staff is top notch. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I will say that Harbor Bays stuff seems to shrink significantly even when we are doing cold wash and line drying. So it may be worth getting a tall size even if you are not tall. Other than that I limit myself to a couple trips per year because otherwise I wouldnt have much of a paycheck left!',5
'Wow this place is good for breakfast at least. Took a sick day from work and decided to take a nice bike ride through old town with my bf and came across Daily dose. We were seated immediately outside on the patio and the staff was very nice. Every waitress that passed us asked if we had our drink order taken yet although it was repetative it was being thorough. I love that they serve cucumber water and their orange juice is hand squeezed too. I ordered the southwest flannel hash which was a wonderful flavorful take on the classic corned beef hash. I loved this dish sooo much I dont know if I would be able to order anything else on my future visits. The meat was cooked so well along with the potatoes tomatillos and onions. It came with 2 perfectly cooked and seasoned eggs and one of the best quality white toast Ive had. The butter was even impressive and spread so easily. My bf got the chorizo omelet with potatoes and it was really good too. The waitress was very friendly and made sure to check on us consistantly. We saw that they have a great sounding happy hour and plan to come back and give it a try! I would recommend Daily Dose for breakfast!',5
'Service was great food was even better.  Had the Shrimp and Chicken Carbonara and it was sooo good.  Manager roamed the area and asked how the service/food was.  Good to see there is still great customer service out there.  I will definitely be back!',4
'Every time my boyfriend and I want a REAL burger we come to The Grind! This place is seriously hands down the best gourmet burger youll put in your mouth. The size is beyond perfect they always cook our patty to a perfect medium rare. The patty is seared and crispy on the outside and soft and juicy on the inside. The sweet and spicy burger is our favorite because its the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The textures work perfectly from the crispy fried toppings candied jalapenos soft bun juicy and tender patty. JUST AMAZING. Their mixed fries are delicious because you get sweet potato and herbed fries mixed in one container. The atmosphere is really nice and the service is always quick and excellent. I would highly recommend this place. Weve tried burgers all over the valley from Fatburger Delux Modern Burger Zinburger and The Grind is hands down the best burger in town!',5
'They seem to have pretty much anything you would want. I dont have a military background but the place seems complete. They can draft dog tags on the spot as well.',4
'I tried getting into this place a couple of times only to be denied by lack of parking and a packed house. However I was finally able to get in and ordered a few of the spring rolls. The spicy spring roll with the fried pork was fantastic! So spicy I almost passed out. Now thats my kinda nummy.  I also ordered the veggie Pho but asked to add meat to it. I need my meat. It was a very good bowl of Pho...Pho sure. I will definitely go back.  Update: I rode my bike with a friend over to Rice Paper on Saturday and I had a blast! I sat outside with the owner and we all spent about 20 minutes chatting drinking and having a good ole time.   We ordered a lot of food and spent a lot of money. We loved the calamari so much that we got 2 orders. We had a few drinks sat out on the patio which is new and has great plans ahead for it. The owner tells me that they will be putting in a fireplace outside and everything.  I am definitely going to be a regular at this joint. Great food great staff and friendly owner!  As for parking. You can park next door and across the street. You can also park up against the building next to the establishment right in the driveway. Just make sure you leave room for others to get by and for more cars to park. I have a feeling this place is going to be the talk of the town.  The only negative thing I have to say is that I believe if you come in during happy hour you should get happy hour prices the whole time youre there. Ive been to a lot of places that do this some dont...I wish they all would though.',5
'Howdy Az Foodies  Dont you just love driving down the road scoping out new places and promising to one day try them.... and then  you finally do?  Thats how this review will start... I went to get a burger from a place that used to be a burger shop but apparently is now this mesquite mexican and burger place?  This piqued my interest.... its kind of like mixing an italian restaurant with a chinese restaurant...  I go to a mexican restaurant to get mexican food and a burger place to get a burger...but who knows... maybe they do make a good burger?  Never got the chance to find out what any of it tastes like..  It started like this... I walked in and there was 2 people ahead of me.  A nice man...looked like a manager/owner?.... greeted us and as they took orders found they didnt have the carne adasa or rice therefore they stopped production and went to chop up meat and find rice and no idea what else because we all just stood there waiting while this young female employee stood there looking dumbfounded!  The beans sat there on the tortillas on the work area waiting for ingrediants to arrive...I should mention at this  time that they took the tortillas out of a grocery store plastic bag!  I was hoping maybe they made their own?  After standing in this line 10 minutes I politely said to the dumbfounded girl...  I have been waiting too long and I think I will leave  I said Thank You and left.  To be fair I know they opened not too long ago so i think i will wait a few months until they have their act together to possibly...maybe try again...  Not sure they will be there months from now if they dont made some serious changes.  Good luck to you Julias....  And to the rest of you......  Bon Appetite',2
'Ive tried several of their dishes at this Flos location and theyve been all good.  What keeps me coming back again and again is their hot and sour soup~ made fresh full of flavor with large pieces of white chicken meat and large shrimps.  Usually when I am feeling under the weather like today I stop by Flos for a quick pick me up of their aromatic and delicious hot and sour soup and after consuming the large bowl big enough for four people I felt better and left a happy customer~ along with a to go order of wonton soup to nurse my coughing throat for later on in the day.',4
'***St. Francis has a great dining room and features local ingredients; while the food was not great on our visit it definitely showed potential***  St. Francis has one of the best dining rooms Ive seen in a long time.  The dining room definitely feels hipster and young but its design is so much better than other restaurants with a young vibe.  Typically these type of restaurants (like Animal and Pizzeria Mozza) feel too dark too loud too cluttered and maybe even too ordinary.  St. Francis though presents a very lively and young atmosphere that is really open warm and with smart design touches.  We came in late at night but there was a fair amount of light in the room which really opened up the room as well as allowed some of their food presentations to shine.  The restaurant featured some great metal tables that reinforced the casual theme.  The booths were comfortable.  The ceilings were highlighted by sharp looking wood rafters (that were outfitted with expertly placed small lights).  The walls of the restaurant were a nice exposed red brick that really went well with the wood fire oven.  The restaurant also featured big large windows that actually looked like mirrors.  The menu (a mix of locally sourced rustic dishes with upscale flair) went very well with the decor.  Unfortunately the food was not as good as the decor though it did show potential and maybe it would have been better if we had ordered differently.  We started with the french fries which were thick and nicely browned.  They looked like carnival fries or Five Guys fries (the kind of fries that go nicely with salt and vinegar).  They are the perfect fries when cooked right because they will be crisp on the outside and hot and soft on the inside.  Unfortunately the fries here were not that crisp.  A little bit soggy.  We had a few of their salads.  One was a Caesar Salad with kale instead of romaine.  The kale was quite bitter.  The salad was heavily dressed (maybe to contrast the bitter greens).  The croutons were fresh and good.  The other salad was a mix of romaine with fresh and crisp apples and smoked bacon.  It had a much better flavor and balance than the Caesar Salad.  We tried a few of the flatbreads.  The flatbreads here were pretty thick and doughy and unlike the crispy and light flatbreads I am more used to having.  We had the chicken flatbread which was roasted chicken arugula and caramelized onion.  The caramelized onion made this pizza too sweet.  The pizza was sweet like BBQ chicken pizza so if you like that type of pizza you may like this one.  The other flatbread was more of a traditional pizza; it was topped with tomato sauce mozzarella and a savory and spicy sausage.  The pizza had a satisfying flavor but it would not stand out against other good pizzas Ive had.  I also had the seafood cioppino which was shrimp clams mussels white fish sourdough and herbs in a spicy tomato broth (finished in their wood fire oven).  I was not a huge fan of the tomato broth.  It had some heat to it but the flavor was not that distinct.  The seafood was unevenly cooked.  Some of the white fish was moist and soft while other bits were dry.  Same for the shrimp.  One shrimp was succulent and nicely cooked while another shrimp was overcooked and quite chewy.  The mussels and clams were not that great (they definitely suffered in comparison to what Ive had in California).  We finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was a sweet date-filled cake on a toffee sauce.  The cake was nicely sweet and somewhat moist though it lacked the consistent throughout-the-cake moistness of the sticky toffee puddings Ive had at Wilshire and Grace.  The sticky toffee pudding was served with sweet cream gelato which was creamy and refreshing.  We also had the banana fosters that seemed to be more like banana cobbler than banana fosters.  The dish consisted of banana slices in a caramel sauce.  The bananas were simply warmed up; they were not caramelized or bruleed.  The bananas were topped with a nut crumble and dark rum molasses gelato.  The dark rum gelato was very good.  It tasted like rum and was creamy and sweet.  Service was pretty causal but pleasant as well as quick and attentive.  Prices were what you would expect given the restaurants reputation and the dishes offered.  A lot of the entrees were in the $18-$23 range.  St. Francis has a great dining room and the food definitely shows potential.  The food on our visit was not great but if you order right you could be in for a good meal.  The restaurant has a very local feel which makes it a good one to try if you are from out-of-town and are looking for something more specific/unique to this area.  There is an attached parking lot with complimentary valet.',3
'Beautiful store beautiful purses.    Holy ridiculous prices Batman!  I must be a real cheap skate or I am just not insane because I cant for the life of me understand paying that much for a purse or a wallet!  Even with the 50% off coupon on the already reduced factory outlet prices I thought the prices were laughable.  There is NFW I am paying $200 for a handbag and kidding myself that I somehow got a steal of a deal.    But if you are into the $200 purse scene then THIS is the store for you!',4
'My grandparents have came here and my father since they were young. I remember  coming here when I was a kid. I have always loved there pork fried rice. The portions are outrageous. Just make sure to eat in to get more. They serve you on large dishes and bowls. When you order take out they come in the typical small white chinese boxes. The place isnt easy on the eyes but the food is well worth it. Hot and fresh!',4
'Good fresh chinese food a little pricey.  There are two types of chinese food. Cheap greasy satisfying chinese food in a questionable joint. And upscale atmospheric chinese food that aspires to captivate the same audiences that enjoy places like P.F Chengs. This would be the latter: an awhatukee hole in the wall version of P.F chengs. Very clean restaurant nice atmosphere and good service. You can tell their motif is such that they cater to the tukee types with a little more coin in hand :/. This is the kind of place youll find a lot of older families or much older groups of friends dining together in.   Both the orange chicken and the almond chicken were good and were made barring on the side of caution when it comes to grease. They were big portions (for $8) with big fresh peices of white meat fresh vegetables and no MSG. There is no chance of this meal offending a pickier type with grease textures or flavors (which makes it less interesting in my opinion).  Both dishes were good but nothing amazing from the 2 dishes I tried.   The green tea ice cream was good but Ive had better green tea ice cream :/ . their version was a little too heavy with cream and could have used some fruit or something creative to go with the ice cream.   The only other dessert option was another flavor of ice cream.  The service was great very polite and friendly waiters.',3
'So glad to finally have a Barros in this part of town.  Love their slice deals at lunch what a steal.  Delivery is timely and friendly as well.  This location is probably the most attractive Ive seen.',5
'I went here today and the staff helping us was super sweet and nice. my daughter told her exactly what she needed. They asked her her height and weight got her what she asked for and we paid and left. Was in and out in 5 minutes.',5
'OK after reading Doctor Js review I just HAD to check it out! Im doing a temp job at Yelps Scottsdale office and this is not far from it. Of course when I needed to find a store I used Yelp!   From the map I thought the Circle K would be facing Camelback but it actually faces Miller Rd. The strip mall is really a big L shape and the dirt lot & Circle K are in the corner thats left over when the mall was built.   I can see why it would look creepy ... its an old location and the bricks & tile are stained. They only get a certain amount each month for repairs and paint job is included in that.   So why four stars? It was CLEAN! There was only one employee working but the place was spotless even the fountain and hot dog areas. It looks like a few shelving units have been removed so it might be getting ready for a major remodeling. If so it should be much less creepy afterward!',4
'I ordered the double on my last visit and OMG seriously OMG! I cant wait to go back.',5
'A family member recently was sent to this facility after a joint replacement. Bottom line: You could die in there and nobody would notice for several hours.',1
'Ive never really been a coffee house kind of guy but then Id never been to Inside the Bungalow before yesterday when I found myself in Mesa with some time to kill. What a seriously cool place. Its an old house - a really big old house - with lots of little private corners to sit and eat/drink chat read compute (apparently they got free wi-fi but I didnt have my laptop with me) just chill whatever. If I lived a little closer I would totally hang out here. Theyve also got a giant patio with a fountain out front - a little hot in the afternoon this time of year but only for another month or so..',4
'Not Impressed....  The staff was really nice... The lobby smelled and looked amazing... We stayed in the main building maybe because it was the oldest part of resort but I was not impressed. Towels run down..... nothing special in the rooms...... not impressed at all.... This was a business trip as my husband works for the Federal Government and were here on Government rate.... I think it is quite sad if the Biltmore puts Government Employees in the not so nice parts of the hotel because of their Government Rate Fare.... Not impressed... Embassy Suites next time... they have much more to offer for those who serve this country.....',1
'My first experience in the store will be my last experience in the store.',1
'When I am in AZ I have come to a particular place outside of a sports venue. Usually I am in AZ for a Dodgers vs Dbacks Game. During those non-Dodger Days I like to travel about 20 minutes east of Phoenix to one of the most authentic swap meets at the Mesa Market Place Swap Meet.  Unlike what I am used to Los Angeles Mesa Market Place Swap Meet is one of those swap meets that you will want to keep coming back for more. In Los Angeles I just want to grab what I am looking for and leave. Mesa Market Place has a huge parking lot. I wouldnt be surprised if Mesa Market would expand another aisle and possibly branch out to do automotive items. It would be something different. Probably do window tints or install aftermarket items.  You will find all sorts of items you would see on eBay and find them here. Whether its cell phone cases luggages to statutes or cooking demonstration you will have a lot of fun walking down four aisles. Oh yeah Mesa Market serves $3 Beers! That is a very BIG PLUS! You can walk down the aisles and drink or sit down and listen to some singing. I definitely got some Chicken Tender & Fries after shopping around. Youll probably get full from getting the freebie trail mixes from the multiple stores that offer them for free.  When you are visiting Phoenix definitely stop by Mesa Market Place. Not all shopping has to be done at the widely invaded Wal-Mart or at the mall but sometimes the swap meet is the cool place to be. I cant believe my one month supply of trail mixes is almost gone in two days. I have to go back and make sure I buy a year supply for a weeks worth :)  Yelp! The One Stop Place For Your Everyday Research!',4
'What the heck is a Pasty??? Upon a friends recommendation we gave Cornish Pasty a try. The food was amazing the staff was efficient friendly and attentive without being annoying and the desserts.... WOW. I usually dont have room for deserts dont make this mistake save room. The Shirley Temple pudding is not from this world. I am now a Pasty fan and will return for more culinary abuse. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the size of the dinning area. Although they have ample room on their patio the seating inside is very limited. Most restaurants have enough seats so that as people finish tables become available regularly. Here there are 4 tables so your wait time if you want to eat inside can be long. If you go before 5:30 you should be fine if you go after 6 especially with 4 or more prepare to wait. I myself will just go at 5:30 eat and be happy.',4
'To me Body Shop will always score major points for being first.  Yes first.  Who before them was saying beauty products should be good for the environment or  recycle your containers or even better - how they encouraged free trade no animal testing and human rights partially through free trade.  For some time I was addicted to several of their products.  I admit I only refilled one bottle.  Bad me.     Ill admit I rarely shop there now as there hasnt been a Body Shop anywhere near where I lived and I havent been committed enough to the cause to drive over to one for lotions and other body goodies.  But dang they have some awesome stuff.  Its a fun little splurge now and then for me now.  A new package of body butter or foot scrub and Im happy. Ive helped the world supported healthy policies and softened my skin all at the same time.  I know a guy friend whos a huge fan of their mens stuff.  Gotta be honest - I couldnt even tell ya which stuff he gets.  But I know its a lot.  And hes tried most if not all of them.  He freaking loves them.  And hes not gay - his girlfriend got him started with this obsession.  So really straight guys - you can shop there.  Its ok.  Yea a lot of other stores have gone green too.  But its great to keep supporting one of the places that started it all.',4
'Ok so its 1 star since I cant go any lower. One of the worst Indian food experiences I have had in the US. The service would was horrible and the owner just downright rude. I went there for a lunch with a couple of friends and was informed rather rudely that they only have a buffet for lunch. This was disappointing since I had my heart set on certain traditional dishes some of which were part of the buffet already. The owner couldnt seem to care less whether we stayed or left and pretty much seemed to give us an ultimatum to either eat the buffet or leave. It being late we decided to try the buffet was sub-par. Barely an item I could think of going back for... In short avoid it if you can. The service makes its not worth it.',1
'I wanted to like this place because the decor was nice and its so close to campus.  Unfortunately the drink I had just wasnt good.  I ordered a medium iced mocha and it just tasted powdery.  In addition the portion was tiny.  The cup was what Id expect a small iced drink to look like.  Definitely not worth the $4 it came out to with tax.  Maybe Ill give the teas a try someday but Im pretty turned off right now.  If its a coffee drink you want Id suggest going a mile north and getting some Dutch Bros instead.',2
'This is an easy place to pick for lunch with my work friends.  They offer a nice selection of salads where even a half order is too much for one person - like other reviewers the caramelized peach is my favorite.  Artichoke and spinach dip is always tasty pear / gorgonzola pizza is delicious the new bianco flat bread is tasty and my lunch companions always get different salads and pizzas and are always pleased.  They did switch to sourdough bread for a start - not my favorite but theirs isnt too powerful.  I liked the herb oil but that didnt get to our table with the last visit so it might be out already.  Parking is easy at least until they replace On the Border which is across the street and the best place to park when you visit.  Service is mostly good but we have had a couple of bad experiences not enough to change my opinion though.  Ask for salad dressing on the side if youre concerned about getting too much Im not a fanatic but they load it at times and it will turn a nice salad into a drippy slaw.  The guy that manages this place during the day does a great job and always looks tired I would too if I had to deal with running a place like this.  Its a chain and and a tad overpriced...that being said its a pretty good option when you cant figure out what else to do.  A true 3.5 but Ill round it up for how hard they try.',4
'BEST happy hour ever!!  Its sort of hidden but has a great bar area and patio.  I dont know about the regular dinner but it looks formal and the bar is great and relaxing.  Itsalways fun to try to watch someone order/eat the Big A$$ Burger.  I thought the scallops were great.   Expect it to be packed anytime after 4:30.',5
'Kim is an amazing waitress. She is professional and the pinnacle of kindness. She knows her job so well and is a master of her craft.',5
'Tonight was the second time Brady and Max visited the Washington Park Dog Park--Saturday mid-morning I took them to see how they would behave off the leash in such a large area. Then we were the only ones there and I thought it was a good thing. Tonight there were a couple dozen dogs and their owners...and I braced for the worst. As soon as we approached the small dog section nearly every dog inside came barking over towards us and followed us to the entrance. Fortunately a wonderful lady inside suggested we take out dogs off their leashes and that should calm down all the dogs. Amazing! It did the trick. And Brady and Maxs first official social outing--off the leash--was a success.  A couple of observations: There is actually shaded areas (trees) in the middle of the small dog section. There is plenty of grass and a water spiggot. You can take your plastic grocery bags and donate them in the dispensers. Nighttime can be challenging because of the limited lighting but not impossible. Well take flashlights with us if we go this late again.  Overall Id have to say this dog park suits us nicely with adequate street parking and friendly dog owners to make for a great time. Well be visiting other dog parks but this one is close by.',4
'Disclaimer:  The following review was made prior to the recent changes (including the menu) at C4.  The review has been updated following the old one ...  The two times that Ive been here was to both eat and drink.  The Food: Completely average but the prices were a pleasant surprise for the Central Corridor.  To start my gf and I had edemame which tastes like every other restaurant edemame only cheaper which made it taste immediately better than any other.  We then had sushi which was pretty forgettable which is another way of saying that i literally dont remember what it was.  For the entree I had the Mahi sandwhich which was decent but tasted almost swampy which was weird.  My gf had the fried tofu which she did not finish due to her dissatisfaction with it.  Oh well I considered it inexpensive bar food anyway because the main reason we were there was to drink.  The Drinks:  Are good and the atmosphere is pretty cool.  I actually preferred the set-up of Camus much more however because the low tables in the bar dining room are waay too short and feel misplaced in there.  They need to invest in some high-tops and i really miss the cushion back couches lining the wall of Camus.  Oh well ... because then we headed up to the rooftop bar.    Okay so on our first two visits its incomplete.  There is no bar up there or even any service but according to the staff its in the works.  When this becomes available this will be a very cool very chill spot.  It has the striking urban views of our citys best scraper-lined street Central Ave and really comfortable couches.  You can take your drinks up there and they want you to put them in plastic but just casually sneak your wine glass up there with you and no one will give you heat.      The three star ranking is a result of:  ~  Below average but inexpensive food ~  Average drink prices ~  Good location ~  Good views ~  Cool rooftop patio   NEW REVIEW:  So we returned to C4 to check out the new menu and it has been upgraded tremendously.  The food is much better I had the chili beer short ribs which was smothered in a tasty sauce and fell right off the bone.  Good choice!  My gfs chopped salad was serviceable but rather dinky.  When Ben the owner stopped by to inquire about our thoughts on the food he said that he agreed with the opinion on the salad and that he would upgrade it immediately.  THATS service!  The prices have gone up slightly but you get what you pay for.  Quality food worth returning for.  We had a delicious frozen lime tart to complete the meal (made in-house!) and we were very sated.  We returned to the rooftop to catch the end of Sunsets and lemme tell you this will be a Valley hot spot in no time.  Word just has to get out.  Its been greatly expanded to cover most of the roof and the views are like no other drinking establishment in town.  People just love to drink up high.  The seating has also been reconfigured to maximize space and the sightline.    Ill definitely be returning to this place for both the food and atmosphere up top.',2
'It has been so long since I have been to Crate & Barrel and I have no idea why I stayed away for so long. I was up at Kierland and saw the store and decided to pop in and check it out. I am so glad that I did. I was checking out the dog supplies and Howie got a new water and food bowl and a new toy and id tag and I got a key chain too:) OK there were other purchases made but when I was looking at the dog stuff I needed some help and it was so amazing how helpful everyone was. The girl who was helping me went to get me a basket and chatted for a few too like it was no hassle. Then at check out it was so pleasant. When I got home it was so nice to see everything wrapped so nicely. Thanks for taking the time and effort!!!',4
'Love the family feel they remember me as a regular fast affordable and great service',5
'This Safeway is THE WORST. The lines are always super long the staffing is minimal and not enough to cover the customers shopping and the employees are rude/inappropriate. While checking out once the checker and the bagger were having a political argument and the checker turned to me and asked Do you like Obama? That is not an appropriate question.  The only time I ever shop here is when it is more convenient and I regret my decision every time.  Plus my son is always disappointed that they dont have any fire truck shopping carts but Ill let him write about that in his own review... whenever he learns to talk and write.',1
'How wonderful and delightful my lunch be! I had Asian Chicken grilled salad.  Fun place for kids. The have a nice play area.',4
'I like having a village in close to where I live for times when Im in the mood for breakfast but dont feel like cooking it. Theyve recently updated the place to have kind of a retro/modern feel...new paint new pictures new booths - I like it! I dont really like their new logo but Im not there to eat their logo so Ill get used to it eventually. Also they have free wi-fi here if thats important to you.   Food is always good love their pancakes and a lot of menu items to choose from. I tried the new chicken ranch sandwich - yums! This place was pretty busy around Saturday 11am. Ive heard they have a free slice of pie on Weds type deal so maybe one of these days Ill check that out.',4
'Ive been going to Rainbow Donuts since their first location was opened on N. Cave Creek Rd.  Then another one popped up on N. 7th St. in the Sunnyslope AZ area.  And then again I drove by the E. Thunderbird location where another establishment had been and Voila  ~  Rainbow Donuts  ~  closer to my home than the others!  Thats a bad thing right?  Anyway their donuts are top notch although the raspberry filled jelly donuts usually my favorite anywhere manage to disappoint.  Why may you ask?  The jelly inside is a raspberry flavored concoction - not a derivative of actual raspberries.  Other than that (and I HAVE to eat my donuts warmed up!)  Rainbow Donuts still continues to be my favorite.  When I was there last month I perused their other offerings as well.  In addition to donuts are breakfast sandwiches muffins bagels lunch sandwiches other pastries espresso and smoothie drinks.  There are other valley locations as well.  Try it - youll like/love it!',5
'In and out quick with hot coffee. Friendly staff. Good Starbucks.',4
'I went here to escape the heat and do a fun activity. The staff was rude and unwelcoming. It was so hot inside the building my friend and I left dripping in sweat. I dont think they had any air conditioning. Only stayed for an hour because of the heat In the building.',2
'Just left Brat Haus and will never return.  I used to love this place but just had the worst night of service and food ever.  The patio was crowded and the place was way understaffed.  It took forever to get our drink order in.  The beer came out room temp.  The garlic fries came out next and were cold.  We waited around for the server to return with condiments but he never did.  I had to get up and find him to let him know the fries were cold and we needed condiments.  He brought out condiments and a new order of hot fries.  The new fries were much better.  My date had one bite of her salad and found a large piece of wet paper towel in her salad.  I immediately showed the waiter and he took it away and asked if she wanted another salad.  A food runner came back with a new salad and apologized for the paper towel and told us the salad was organic and came wrapped in towels and he didnt knew how it got in there.  Since they had cleared my food by then and took her salad she had no silverware.  We waited 5 minutes before a server was in site to ask for more silverware.  The check took forever to come and when our waiter brought it he told us he comped the salad.  Overall 7 strikes against Brat Haus for the horrible service and aweful food tonight.  I wish it had been better since I used to love this spot.  Unfortunately I dont think I will be returning.',1
'Cant say enough nice things about this place.  We were so happy to find it when out for a walk.  Charming spot in the cute little Cheery Lynn neighborhood but right on 16th so its easily accessible.  Lots of places to sit outside on the wrap-around porch as we did.   Just Mrs. G behind the counter taking our order (so friendly and welcoming!) and Jimmy made our food (he was also really nice and asked how we enjoyed our meal).  The food is high quality but very reasonably priced.  We got two burger meals one specialty burger and one custom with a side of avo for the babe and it came to $20 even.  I had the Blazing Burger and it was fantastic!  Just spicy enough to keep you wanting more but not overpowering. Enjoyed everything about the food you can tell the ingredients are quality from the vegetables to the buns to the huge (properly cooked) meat patty.  Hard to pick a  favorite between the fries (use the special fry-seasoning in the can on the condiment bar next to the Sriracha (another win)) and the onion strings!  I like their apparent philosophy.  Keep it simple keep it quality. Very much want to come back and try breakfast and wish they were open for dinner!  Looking forward to returning.  Thanks Jimmy Gs!  Way to be.',5
'I was en route to Japan when I flew over the W hotel in Scottsdale. I looked down and noticed a bunch of cool tables and booths located next to the sidewalk. I couldnt make out what the sign in front said because I was already at 2500 ft. and ascending. I asked the guy next to me if he knew and he said  Im in the middle seat I can only see wingtips you moron.  So I made a mental note to myself  to find out which restaurant was located there. 2 weeks later I had returned. I found out that it was Sushi Roku. I thought to myself theres no way it could it be as good as the sushi I just had in Japan for the last 2 weeks. Well Ive only been wrong 3 times in my life before the day I ate at Sushi Roku. Now I can honestly say Ive been wrong 4 times. I had no idea how fantastic everything is here. The decor blew me away from the get go. Its an interior designers heaven. Very modern and clean. I was floored by the warm greetings and smiles my wife and I received right as I walked in the door. Now then theres sushi and then theres Sushi. The Toro sashimi I had was so fresh I thought it was gonna swim right out of my mouth!! I mean Harrow!!!  Everything from the Filet Wrapped Asparagus to the Shima roll was fantastic. Ironically our servers name was Ross too. Classic.  He was able to answer any questions we had and he also suggested several menu items that we ended up ordering which lead me to write this review. God he was impressive. Fantastic experience overall.   I cant wait to go back!!',5
'A number of coworkers have raved about this place so we decided to give it a try. Since the weather was beautiful we considered sitting outside on the patio but the noise from 7th street is just too loud. Not the restaurants fault but sitting so close to a major traffic artery with the noise and vehicle fumes just isnt appealing when dining.  The interior is very small but quaint and appropriately decorated. We enjoyed a nice glass of Malbec before ordering our entrees: Roast Leg of Lamb w/sides of Greek potatoes and Greek salad and Shrimp Santarini w/sides of roasted beets and Greek salad. The food was good - nothing spectacular. I found it strange that the salad and beets were served on the same plate and that the beets were cold - I was expecting the roasted beets to be war rm. It was like have beets in a salad which is OK just not was was expected. Our waiter described the shrimp dish as being on a bed of sauteed spinach - Im not sure what his definition of bed of spinach was because I really had to look to find it - maybe one bite worth. But there were a fair number of shrimp and the dish was flavorful and just the right amount so I didnt leave feeling stuffed. The lamb was OK;  again nothing spectacular.  The service was mediocre. The waiter was friendly but he never checked back with us after our food was delivered except to bring our check. There is a fine balance between a waiter constantly bugging the patron and backing off enough to let the patrons enjoy their meals but the place wasnt busy so Im not sure why he was MIA.  The most unappealing aspect of the evening though were the little flying bugs! The owner did happen by our table to see how we were doing and I asked him about them. He said they were fruit flies and they happen about 1 day a year in the neighborhood and then they are gone. He kind of discounted them like it wasnt a big deal. Im not an entomologist (or fly expert) but I though fruit flies bigger than these little pests - these were really teeny. They reminded me of the flying gnats that potted plants in offices often get. None the less it is very unappetizing to have these flies/gnats around when you are trying to eat! I would have at least like the owner to apologize when asked about the flies instead of poo-pooing them like they were inconsequential. Sorry I just dont want to be swatting flies away from my food when eating!  All in all a cute quaint place with good not great or memorable food. Maybe its better for lunch. With all the other options available in the area and beyond Im not sure its worth a repeat visit.',3
'What can I say... I am a bargain shopper! Im not cheap but I get more satisfaction out of getting a bargain than I do spending a ton of money for a name brand item at Nordstrom or Sax Fifth. That being said sure you can find a pair of shoes youll like here but the selection is simply OK and its usually full retail price. Most of the time they have a two-for-one deal or get the second pair half price. Still its never really any kind of sweet deal.',2
'I was thrilled when I discovered this place at the mall RIGHT NEXT TO MY HOUSE. I finally went in a few weeks ago and got a cupcake seeing how I absolutely love cupcakes. And it was just meh. It was huge. But it was dry and I was just in love with it the way I wanted it to be. Maybe because it was a week day mid day...it had been sitting for a while. Maybe next time im at the mall I will stop in and try them again but for now...2 stars. Huge cupcakes but it was definitely dry.',2
'Theres little to say other than that I love this place. Cheap fast and they deliver. All of the meats cheeses veggies and breads are fresh. Never had a bad customer service experience. The only thing I can really attest to is that they are liberal users of mayo; be aware of that when ordering online and ask for packets instead. :-P',5
'Yum burgers',5
'Some quick prices/info before I start my review: - $9.75 for adult tickets in the afternoon or evening $8.50 for matinees. - $11 for a reserved adult ticket in the afternoon or evening $8 for reserved seat for children and seniors. - $5 for morning movies. - $9 to $12.50 for salads pizzas sandwiches and appetizers.

Ok we went to SMG last night for drinks and a late movie. When we first walked in I was beyond excited to experience a reasonably priced dine/drink in movie. The bar area was great and the staff was very friendly. We hung out in the lounge area for about an hour eating and drinking until our movie began seating.  Once in the theater everything went downhill fast!  We decided to sit in the back row in an oversized (very firm) chair. This decision was based mainly on the fact that our only alternative was a rolly office chair. WHAT you ask? Correct. Uncomfortable office chairs were in the theater. Weird to say the least.  We along with the other patrons continued to order drinks and food in the theater. Big mistake. The theater is not set up correctly for employees to be walking around delivering food/drinks discussing orders and dropping checks. I was so distracted by the massive number of people walking back and forth in front of me that I started counting them! After about 30 minutes of counting I had reached 41 times that an employee walked in front of me to attend to something. I understand that it is their job and it was the first night but I was so distracted that I left the movie frustrated and not knowing what I had just watched.  All in all I want to like this place. It is in a great location and the staff was friendly. I also loved the bar aspect. I plan to go back in a few weeks after they have had time to work out the kinks and see if my movie watching experience improves.',3
'Ive never been to a restaurant where we (a party of 6 with a reservation) sat at a cleared table with no water no bread no cutlery no service for 15 minutes before receiving a menu .... when we finally had someone provide a menu it then took another 15 minutes to get the wine we ordered.  Still no bread still no food.   The server dumped the wine bottle on the table (unopened) and went to find glasses. 10 minutes later she then threw the bottle opener at our table so we could open the wine ourselves while she went to find glasses. Most (!?!) of the wine glasses arrived within the next 10 minutes and still no bread or food.  Do I need to go on?   And while the server apologized profusely she never offered to take anything off the bill or even a dessert on the house for our clearly disgruntled group.   Food was fine -- the house-made burrata is quite remarkable. But not enough of a reason to return. Others we were with have had better experiences and I would hope for the owners sake that our dinner was an aberration...',2
'Location- easy to find and plenty of parking Ambiance- casual clean and sensible. Although the owner is continuously trying to modernize the place. Service- friendly. You order upon entering find a table and it will be taken to you. Usually a 5 to 10 min wait to get your food depending what was ordered. Food- Delicious! They have a simple menu with much variety of choices: gyros burger hot dog greek pizza pasta and salads. I enjoy that you can choose a salad as a side vs french fries.',4
'I have no idea why I keep returning to this place it really isnt great or fancy.  Last night I didnt even like the salsa and the chips seemed stale.  I had a pork burro very very very very very salty.  Yikes!  And I a usually the one who uses the salt shaker.  I guess it is convenient to meet a friend but something has got to give here.  One more shot then I will possibly have to move on.  Oh and did I mention that they didnt even offer us a refill on the chips?  they gave us an extra salsa but whatcha gonna do with extra salsa?  It was ok just not great...',3
'Classic whole in the wall Filibertos style restaurant.  Very unpretentious and basic style. Located in Guadalupe. Ordered the Chili Rellenos special for lunch. Reasonably priced at ~ $7. I usually only buy the Chili Rellenos dinners -so I can compare all the Mexican restaurants an also because I love this dish. Anyways - rice nice and fluffybeans tasty and Chili Rellenos very tasty. Also came with a side of salsa and another spicy sauce. I talked to some of the locals who were  eating there and they all seemed very happy with the food. One guy pointed out that he always came on a Wednesdays for the $1 Tacos. Unfortunately I missed the specials signs.  Nice covered area out front plus eating in-side if required.  As Arni said - Ill be back',5
'This use to be one of my favorite antique stores.  It is under new ownership it seems the new business model is to take cheep beat up furniture and paint it with house paint and not carefully I might add just slop it on.  Looks like they used oops paint colors too.   So disappointing as this place use to be great.',1
'Interesting environment and awesome food.  I highly recommend giving the az88 buffalo chicken sandwich a try.   I am personally not a fan of blue cheese so I substituted ranch and it was delicious.  The chicken breast is not fried and almost tastes blackened with a perfect buffalo sauce with pieces of celery on top.  I was feeling indulgent and got it with the fries which were cooked perfectly but tried some of the grilled vegetables from another plate at my table and wish I had chosen them.  The grilled vegetables have almost a smokey flavor and are cooked to perfection.  Cant wait to visit scottsdale again to swing by and have another one of these sandwiches.',5
'Hosted my BFFs baby shower here.  They were great!  They took excellent care of our group.  Everyone loved it.    Their pizza and salad assortment is fantastic.',4
'I am overall very impressed with the Cracker Barrel brand but what makes any one location better than another is the service.  Weve never had bad service here and Ive been here more times than my check-ins would indicate.  The breakfast is as good as most higher priced places.  The only set-back is how crowded it gets but thats just part of going to Cracker Barrel.  Everyone loves it.  Their servers are usually top notch.  Ive got nothing bad to say about this location.',5
'I always hate giving bad reviews but our service left quite a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke.  We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldnt be a problem at all except that our waitress didnt return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons but it certainly wasnt so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately on each of our visits the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused  The food itself was quite good. The Shepherds pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced.   Considerably later in the evening our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying shed remove it but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of $20 on the credit card. The rest in cash She continually read back excessively complex scenarios and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card thats all.  When she returned she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. Thats just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself.   We spoke to the manager who couldnt find her for some time and when she showed up she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill with the extra drink.  It wasnt worth arguing about at that point.  The sad part is that everyone at my table and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon.',2
'If you are a fan of Mexican cuisine and love green chile this is the place for you. 2 locations family owned and operated made fresh daily. Huevos rancheros & machaca beef are favorites always covered in green chile.',5
'Went during lunch (This review is only for the sushi and dinning menu/side).  This was an El Paso before they remodeled the place up pretty nice.  The server was extra super nice and friendly.  We heard her explain the menu for 5-10 mins to a couple of elder ladies over and over again.  Gyoza (pork dumpling) - Was pan fried and VERY GOOD  Sushi & Sashimi is a al carte (1pc per order - prices $1.5 to 3.5)    Octopus Tuna and Yellowtail - My husband said they were good  Chicken Tempura Lunch (Includes Miso soup tempura veggies and rice) - the light tempura batter was excellent.  When dipped into the tempura sauce YUM YUM YUM...  Nabe Yaki Udon Lunch (Udon noodles with chicken veggies egg & a shrimp tempura) - The soup base was good noodles texture was just right and all the goodies were very good too.    We will need to go back to try the tepanysaki side!!',4
'I was very excited to use a groupon I purchased at this place. After hearing great reviews on twitter I decided to check it out. I ordered a chix pita app of hummus and hubby ordered the filet sand kebob..both came with fries. (not a fan) the hummus was definatley lacking something was very tahini flavor. The chix was a joke. maybe 2 small pieces on the pita. The filet was horrid!! tasteless and just not good. Save your time and go to cyprus pita pita jungle or Zs greek..',2
'I am literally distraught that this place is closed. Oh how I looked forward to my Panchos run when I go back to AZ but obviously this isnt going to happen. I have to admit after the manager from Fort Worth left the quality went way down. Panchos is a childhood staple as I grew up in Fort Worth and my grandpa used to take us every Saturday morning at 11 am. (And you BETTER not be late!) Goodbye my tex-mex in AZ for now I will have to wait until I make it back to Texas to eat you again. This is the one I frequented while in Fort Worth:   http://www.yelp.com/biz/panchos-mexican-buffet-fort-worth',4
'Ive been coming to Paradise Nails since it has opened. I get my eyebrows done here regularly and what a fantastic job. Ive never had an issue. Sometimes the wait is a little long and their prices have gone up a bit for other services but I will continue to come here for my eyebrows.',5
'I would highly warn against renting any of this companys units.  After 5 years of renting with them the service went from bad to worse. The rentals are affordable but their service is ridiculous.  From no air conditioning for days on end to roof leaks in a childs room that went ignored in monsoon season.  I would not wish them on anyone. Renters beware.',1
'After receiving $35 in game cards for Dave and Busters from my workplace for winning a contest I invited my boyfriend to come with me last night for dinner and games. The dinner part was a mistake.  We first approached the hostess stand to try and get a table in the main dining area (not the bar). The hostess seemed really clueless when we asked her how long it would be. She just said ummmmm..... and turned around to stare at the dining room (for about 5 minutes). There were clearly a few dirty tables and some empty ones that were clean but she told us it would be a 20 minute wait. So we tried looking for a table in the bar area and found one immediately that another couple had just gotten up from. I hailed the bartender to ask if he could send someone over to clean the table. After waiting another 5-10 minutes or so our waitress finally came over and cleaned the table for us.   The service was fine; nothing to write home about but I do understand that a) It was a very busy saturday night and b) we were sitting in the bar area and not drinking so I wasnt expecting stellar service. We did get everything we needed within a pretty reasonable amount of time considering the previous factors.   The food on the other hand was completely underwhelming. I felt like I wasted $40 on that dinner to be honest. I ordered some kind of seafood and steak trifecta and it was anything but that. It was kind of lukewarm the steak was super tough and well done even though I asked for medium rare. Although they were small pieces on skewers and I do understand its harder to cook those to a specified temperature they were decidedly overcooked. I thought the shrimp were supposed to be in some kind of sauce and grilled but they just looked like plain pink cocktail shrimp somebody had stuck on a skewer popped in the microwave for a few seconds. The best part of the meal was the rice pilaf it was all served over. My boyfriend got a chicken parmesan sandwich which he was pretty happy with but I tasted it and thought it was kind of gross too. We skipped dessert and went on to play some games.  The games were great no complaints there! At the end of the night we earned 1450 tickets which got me one pretty awesome stuffed elephant and a shot glass for both myself and my boyfriend.  Bottom line: Go for the games (and maybe booze); get the dinner somewhere else. There are way too many good options nearby to waste your money here on subpar food.',3
'I too had the lunch special and thought for the price it was a good deal. My pita bread was ice cold and stale which sort of put a damper on the whole meal. I was expecting more. I liked the variety of meat selections served with the lunch special but the steak was grizzly. Also the rice was just okay - it was a tad dry. Also the decor and ambiance was nothing special and sort of depressing. Ill probably go back and try them again but Im not racing back.',2
'Great food.  Plenty of football.  Awesome prices  Chill atmosphere.  Best cheese fries in the neighborhood.',4
'Kudos to the owner for handling my last review with such grace. He sent me a very sincere message assuring me necessary precautions were being taken to prevent the mishap from happening again. Unfortunately I wont be back anytime soon not because I dont want to but because I cant--- Ive since moved out of state. I will definitely stop by for lunch if/when I visit Arizona again.   I have no doubt the Cafeteria will succeed under Bryans ownership. If only all business owners could be like him!',5
'I was in town visiting a friend and he suggested we try Scottsdale Quarter for shopping & restaurants.  There are a ton of restaurants in Scottsdale Quarter and Tanzy seemed to have the most diverse menu and great decor.  Everything about this place oozes cool.  PROS: 1.  Ambience - the restaurant has beautiful modern decor and attracts a young upscale crowd.  As you enter there is large lounge area with sofas which makes it great for large groups to relax together.  We actually ate in the lounge area and it was comfortable and relaxing.  2. Food - I tried a mozzarella bruschetta appetizer that is made in front of you which was a nice touch and also tried a pasta dish for my entree.  Both dishes tasted good and the presentation looked fantastic.  CONS: 1. Service - the service is so-so.  As I mentioned we chose to sit in the lounge area and our waitress would check-in on us every 20-30 minutes even though the restaurant was pretty quiet.  Our glasses were empty and took us awhile to get our entree order in after getting appetizers.  2. Price - the two of us ordered 2 appetizers 2 entrees and a couple of drinks each.  Total cost about $110 (including tax & tip).  A little pricey.  Overall I would visit this restaurant again once or twice a year for special occasions and group events.',4
'Their food is amazing -- all of it.  Love the gyro veggie combo greek salad shawerma falafel baba ganoush.  Make a point to order the house-made pita instead of the Armenian bread.  Always great service. Im also a big fan of the grocery store part of the joint.  You just have to try one of their baklavas -- walnut almond pistachio or cashew -- all divine.  Fab for tea and spices too.',5
'I remember trying this place 2 years ago and I was not impressed. About a month ago I decided to give them another chance and tried the Kung Pao Chicken and since then I have literally been back 6-7 times. For the price its the best Kung Pao I have ever had. The vegetables are fresh the sauce is unique and theres plenty of peanuts an ingredient that imo makes or breaks a good Kung Pao. Their lunch and dinner combos come with fried rice something I dont care for but their fired rice isnt bad at all.',5
'Really the only spot in the area but that doesnt take away from the quality.  Get the daily special and you cant go wrong.',3
'I cant believe theres only 2 reviews for Fit Health!!!Dont know why the one was filtered either. I have been going to Dr.Patric for going on 3 years now. This is a family practice that handles a bit of welleverythingand handles everything well. You wont be left waiting ad infinitum before seeing a medical professional here.You wont be treated like a co-pay.... The practice focuses on treating people like....wait for it....HUMAN BEINGS.What a concepthuh? Youll never be rushed out(unless its discovered youre having a true medical emergency and need the benefit of an ambulance). The office is spotless cleanwelcoming and private. Its obvious they care about the patients. I have sent several people to this facilityamong them a few who were incredibly physician phobic. All have had positive experiences and some have even made Fit Health their go tolike I have. Ohand no appointment????Just walk in.... YesI said it...they take walk ins. I have done just that on several occasions and still have never had any kind of medical office waiting game. Go see Dr.Patric and see what medical care should be.',5
'This place quickly became my favorite bar in Scottsdale. The staff are always amazing and are ready to recommend a drink. The bartenders treat their job like a profession not just a cool job. So they know their stuff and their drinks. John the bar manager is a great guy to talk to. In fact I should go back when he is working and pick his brain some more about tending bar. Seriously when my Dad and I were there. He just told us all about tending bar and all the cool things he learned. And as someone who is getting into the hotel industry I might need this knowledge at some point. And go during Happy Hour which starts at 3. Great drink specials. Cant speak on the food only had it once. But the menu has changed a lot since then.   Drink of Choice at Old Town Whiskey: Moscow Mule  Because it is made in the traditional old copper cup. Which makes  it taste better I swear it does. Also it made with my favorite Ginger Beer from Australia which is always hard to find here in the US. Must remind myself to ask them where they get it.',5
'Another fun wine tasting in the books! The fella that hosted the Arizona Strongold wine tasting was awesome and we want to thank Todd for selecting some fantastic cheeses for us. The tapas plate was pork belly and blue cheese stuffed dates....incredible!  If you havent tried a wine tasting here yet put it n your to do list!',5
'I go here at least once a week...mostly for wine and beer. They have pretty good deals and carry some brands that even total wine or bevmo dont have.  They also have little chocolates and foods from around the world.  The layout is organized and clean. The stuff they carry will defiantly add a little somethin somethin to any house. Im all for knick knacks too. Ive bought coffee cups salad bowls and utensils my big budda for good luck whove ive named kingston some artwork curtains and more bar glasses then I need. My Bf hated me when i came home with a world market bag. Then I would pull out a a beer sampler for him and a bottle of wine for me all smiles!',5
'I think Arik and Eric summed it up pretty well. WOW I was under the impression I never had to pay cover......anywhere.........EVER!! I almost had 30 years of this luck I guess because that streak was broken last night and it was not worth it IMO. I should have stayed at FEZ and followed Thomas & Rickie home. *sigh* Really!?!?! Whos idea was this anyway!?!?! I got poked and prodded like a cow here which I usually dont mind so much but there was definitely attitude here that I dont really care to experience again. I was watching the bartender Her name was Naomi lets just say I prob wouldnt order anything but beer here and leave it at that.',2
'I bought a living social deal so my bf and I decided to come for dinner...what we didnt realize was that it was restaurant week. The deal included 2 margaritas so we started with those. They were good but nothing special. The waiter said they were made with a standard mix not a freshly made mix. We also asked for chips and salsa. Well thats not on the restaurant week menu so we were told we couldnt order it. Our living social deal was for 2 Margs and 2 entrees. We decided to order chips and guacamole since THAT was on the menu. I asked for a side of salsa...no salsa bc its not on the menu. WHAT?? Seriously! We are at a Mexican food restaurant. No salsa??! Even the table next to us was annoyed at that. Ok. Moving on our food came and it was pretty good. We ordered the chicken enchilada and a pork adobo. We were happy with the flavor but it was super small. The enchilada came by itself on a plate - just one. It was in a typical taco size tortilla like the size youd buy at store (but fresh and the tortillas there are definitely delicious). The pork was good. I didnt care much for the sauce but my bf enjoyed it. The decor was also kinda weird. Mexican food restaurant and the chandeliers were made of wooden clothes pins and painter red white and blue...thats odd to me. Honestly though the food lost its glory bc of the absolutely HORRIBLE service. The manager came by and he was really friendly but our regular server really stunk. Service is almost as important as the food - and they can both just as easily as the other leave a bad taste in your mouth. Im going back to Cien Agaves. Better food fantastic service awesome margaritas and more reasonable prices.',2
'Love the S-Bux. Would give this place FIVE stars since it does have expanded hours and ample seating accommodations BUT....  Parking here is terrible awkward and sometimes dangerous. When things get crazy in the am sometimes the drive-through line can actually gridlock patrons in the parking lot... hard to describe but once you see this place you will understand.  REALLY wish this place would go 24 hrs... its only closed for like 4-5 hours so why the heck not?!?!?!',4
'I used to go across town till I found this place. Good pricescoupon cardsfriendly people',5
'Sometimes you go to some fancy place that is all art and no substance.  Other times you hit the buffet line that is all food and no joy. In Phoenix no one has blended the two as tastefully as St. Francis.   The ambiance is hip without being exclusive.  The building itself is very open and worth the trip in and of itself.  The menu while small is loaded with dishes that will hook you and ensure return visits.   As a starter Id recommend the Pumpkin soup.  Im still trying to come up with an adequate superlative to describe the exhilaration I felt when that first spoonful made contact with my tastebuds.  The flavorful festival continues with the Green Chile Pork.  The dish itself is somewhat small but surprisingly hearty.  And cap off the evening with a desert preferably in the form of the sticky toffee pudding. This place does the city proud and is one more shining light in a re- surging central corridor.',5
'Let me start with the good.  Their fish seemed fresh and they have some interesting well conceived rolls.  Their Scallop Nigiri was fantastic fresh and delicious.  Outside of the scallops their food was Meh.  Had Yakisoba and several rolls; did not try any of their sashimi because it seemed really expensive (4 pc. Sake Sashimi for $9).  We quickly realized why the rolls were cheaper: because there isnt much fish in them.  The fish on the rainbow roll we got  was sliced so thin it was hard to tell how quality the fish was.  The rice to fish ratio was ridiculous leaving with me mostly full but unsatisfied.  We were warned before ordering that they were pretty busy and we should put our sushi order in quickly.  While I appreciate the warning I dont think AN HOUR AND A HALF is an acceptable waiting time with or without warning.  The Yakisoba we ordered came out promptly but after finishing it we waited another full hour for the sushi.  Overall I feel they are overpriced for what you get and the food is not exactly worth the wait.  Not bad by any means but not worth dealing with the price/service.',2
'Mama love peanut butter. Like I REALLY love peanut butter its my favorite food. I could probably easily go through an entire jar with nothing but an appetite and a spoon.   I didnt know this place existed until my boyfriend gave me two jars of their peanut butter. I was speechless and filled with joy (one of my profile pictures is my first bite of one of the jars). I got the dark chocolate and the banana/chocolate...they are both amazing.   On my next visit out to Scottsdale the PB Loco Cafe was a mandatory stop and I was pleasantly overwhelmed with all the options. I got to taste as many as the different types that I wanted (which sold me on the Asian Curry kind too) and enjoyed a sandwich called The Memphis. Sweet Jesus. Peanut butter banana honey and bacon grilled to perfection? It was like one of my wishes had been granted. And not to be too obsessed with this place another profile picture is of me taking my first bite of this delicious sandwich.   I now have at least two of their jars in my own pantry and try to visit the place at least a couple times a year while Im out in Arizona.',5
'We are really lucky to live so close to this place. These guys are great.  Very friendly very knowledgeable and their prices are fair. We went in shortly after moving into the neighborhood we have two fairly new beach cruisers my back tire was a little wobbly and my husband needed a light.   They looked over both of our bikes and let us know what they needed aired up the tires and set up an appointment to true up my back tire it was done on time and for a good price. They also upgraded my husbands bike light for a better one really nice of them.',5
'Poor food and smells like smoke',2
'Holy cow! The Scotts Perfect Reuben-Reuben Sandwich is an accurate portrayal of perfection! I got it with corned beef and pastrami with sauerkraut and Swiss cheese grilled excellently on rye bread.   This is the perfect place in Phoenix to grab a quick bite while you are doing some grocery shopping (or clothing shopping at the Buffalo Exchange a few stores down) and the price is very reasonable here. It came with fries cole slaw and wedged pickles.  It definitely reminded me of what youd find at Kats Deli and Second Ave Deli in NYC!',4
'We went for lunch and the food was wonderful.',5
'Happy hour: started with the Volcano Chicken appetizer. Basically small bits of chicken in a buffalo wing sauce and a scoop of rice and a useless garnish. Not impressive at all. Glass of Pinot Noir for only $4 great deal. Next Sashimi: we tried 4 different types of fish 3 of the 4 tasted the same as if the fish was either previously frozen or very low grade. Also their sushi chefs need some more training in knife skills as the yellowtail had a couple of bits. And the fish portions were all inconsistent with slices of all different widths and lengths and were not very cold. For the same price of a plate of sashimi Ill stick with my benchmark: Hiro in Scottsdale with Japanese chefs and the highest quality fish. Service was very good except for our place setting missing soy sauce dishes that we had to nick from another table.',2
'This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light have a good wine selection and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items.   You MUST get the bruchetta plate.',4
'Five stars.    Any organization that dedicates themselves to a subject like this that makes our students smarter our country stronger and our community more educated deserves five stars.    The volunteers the employees and the sponsors of the program rest assured that WE APPRECIATE YOU!  My son has attended a number of programs here as well as had his birthday party here with a space simulation as well as even met authentic NASA Astronauts.   Folks listen up - the work they do gets our youth interested in engineering careers.  We need more efforts like this.    Thank you Challenger Space Center!',5
'Great service & tasty food but canned mushrooms is a deal breaker.  It tells me other ingredients may also be not fresh.',3
'Great little place in Park Central. made to order personal pizzas and salads all for $7.95. Salads are huge pizzas are made quickly in wood fired oven.  We were there on a quiet Labor Day but on a workday it would be awesome for a quick lunch.  Food was great - loved the steak and blue salad.  I have to try  one of their specialized pizzas next time - pesto chicken or Hawaiian barbecue.  Oh you have to try the Pookie - a warm chocolate chip cookie in a little pie pan with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream for only $3.00.',5
'Quick lunch there today... Gyro sandwich was perfect. Fries were fresh and piping hot! Fast clean casual lunch - appropriately priced. Hope to try the Italian beef next time Im in the neighborhood!',4
'I drive by this place every day on the way home from work.  So after reading good reviews I decided to try it.  After a dinner of fried everything I think I will need a cardiac exam.  I had fried fish and shrimp and fries.  My daughter had popcorn shrimp.  My dad had fried okra and fried zucchini.  We all shared.  The zucchini was good I like their batter but I would have preferred thicker slices of zucchini.  Im not afraid of having an actual vegatable.  The fish was ok but  I had better at Gordon Biersch.  Sorry I usually prefer the local guy just on general principle but this one isnt it.  The fries were not great the shrimp was so heavily breaded that I couldnt taste the shrimp and the popcorn shrimp were all bread.  We did get a side of coleslaw that was as good as any Ive had from the Safeway deli.',2
'First time and last time there. Horrible and unfriendly staff and if you want to see real flamenco dancing please do not waste your time and money to go there! the groupon offer they have is a complete sham! the food was mediocre at best far too greasy and not cooked well. the sangria tasted like coloured sugar water! Overpriced menu and they wonder why it is half empty on a Friday night!',1
'Fez was pretty good but SO expensive. They have limited drink specials and depending on what you get the drink may or not be strong.   Our server was so sweet and the place looks awesome but the actual menu prices would deter me from going back for Happy Hour. There was nothing special about it.   However I wouldnt mind trying it out during their brunch hours.',3
'Check your order before you leave the drive-thru or risk discovering only 75% of your order filled by the time you get home.',2
'Ive always loved the Kabuki in Tempe. I went here for the first time last night for a friends birthday. The place is clean nice and classy.   However while me and my friends were eating edamame half way through I FOUND A MAGGOT STICKING OUT OF MY EDAMAME. I showed it to one of the waitresses who just kind of smiled and didnt even apologize. The manager came out and explained how they use organic edamame and that sometimes things like this happen. He offered us a complementary dessert which we turned down since we brought a cake for our friends bday. He then offered to give me (not everybody else) a discount which I said yes to. When we all got our orders none of us could  eat. My spicy tuna roll tasted like it came from a local grocery store (I was sure it wasnt just the maggot incident).   The manager came back and gave me my sushi for free (My sushi was only $5.50.) He acted like he was doing me a favor. Our server didnt check on us or apologize for the maggot. She didnt really care for our table since she was going to get an automatic 18 % gratuity.  Spend your money someplace else PLS. Go to the Kabuki in Tempe instead. I am never going back to this maggot infested place.',1
'Amazing!  Great selection and without them Id be very unhappy with the selection at Lens Crafters.  I would so go back.  Give them your very best they give theirs.',4
'UPDATE Oct. 2013: I went there again this weekend and it was just like the good old days.  The service was great and the food was absolutely the best food I have ever eaten there.  I got the Nachos with chicken and beef and the flavors of both are amongst some of the best flavored meats I have had anywhere.  They have also remodeled in the past few months and it looks really great.  They added new booths that look nice and are comfortable.   This used to be my favorite mexican restaurant.  However over the last few years it has really been a disappointment.  My most recent visit a week ago was horrible.  They got both orders at my table wrong.  I sent mine back and it came back wrong a second time.  I was so annoyed I ended up just picking it apart and eating the chicken.  My friends just ate hers the way it came. The server offered no apology and I just couldnt wait to pay the check and leave.',4
'Friendly service and new installations but the food just didnt do it for me. In my two visits I was served dry rice and the beans completely covered with American cheese. The nopales con carne were a disappointment because one couldnt taste the nopales. I figured that ordering beef fajitas would be a safe bet but they were just as flavorless as everything else I tried.  For a restaurant that has the reputation of serving great authentic Mexican food my review probably seems harsh - I mean they didnt get that reputation by serving bland Mexican food. So Ill give them a try again in a few weeks and hopefully add stars to this review.',2
'Just had lunch there. What a disappointment. As a single woman I have stopped being surprised when the host or hostess seats me in a out-of-the-way table even when the restaurant is empty...no surprises here. I ordered the brisket sandwich without the sauerkraut not being a fan of sauerkraut.   It was almost impossible to pick up as it was too soggy to handle. The combination of brisket and muenster with caramelized onions was too much for the bun to handle. Had sauerkraut been added it would have been a nightmare. The combination of tastes among the brisket muenster and onions just didnt work...for me. The small dinner salad was fresh and colorful but had too much dressing on it.    My server was very apologetic and did adjust the bill. However  you never get a second chance to make a good impression. With so many other good restaurants in Cave Creek I will not go back.',1
'Love this place! Been coming here since high school. Chicken Terryaki lite w/ brown rice is the business.',5
'I love Ponchos. I grew up in South Phoenix so my family and I came here all the time when I was a kid and I continue to make the drive back here years later and always bring new friends to try the place out. My favorite dish is the Pollo Fundido. Its so good. The salsa in a squeeze bottle is kinda weird but good.   Be sure to check out the room with a mural of ex-Pres. Clinton sitting at the end of your table. And the secret service standing on the opposite wall.',4
'Wonderful view of Phoenix at night Ive travelled many many times to Phoenix and my only regret was not being able to take my wife to Phoenix and also to South Mountain park at night. The view of the city is spectacular. Very romantic spot. Its a bit of a drive from Scottsdale but it is well worth it. You can pretty much see everything from east of Mesa all the way west to Avondale and north to Camelback Mountain. The great thing about this area is usually it is quite clear and there is little or no humidity most of the time.',4
'The rude front desk staff is enough to make me not ever come back again. The older receptionist actually followed me back to my chair to argue with me after we came to an agreement and I smiled said thank you and walked back to where I was sitting. She stood over me and proceeded to argue her point which was that she can be more than 15 minutes late with my appointment but I cant be more than 9. Oh yeah she forgot to mention she had two other wax technicians in the back not currently doing anything. That location is a franchise and the owner was supposed to call me back months ago regarding the altercation. Needless to say my business is gone for good.',1
'I went here a long time ago to get some pre-made lumpia; which they had and the prices werent too high. Since I work full time and have no time to actually make any lumpia they are a god-send.. They had all the Fillipino goodies that I would expect in a store like this. Clean and organized. But dont expect too too much. After all it is a MOM AND POP shop.',3
'I love coming here late on a Saturday night for pizza. The location is great food yummy and the staff is friendly. I like coming here for happy hour and sitting outside.',4
'Annual staycation for wifes birthday.  This place still sets the bar for local resorts. Great pool with added bonus of a cabana without any extra charge.  The bartender made the killer lemon drops that we grew attached to on a previous visit even though they are gone from the drink menu. Just great service and a nice resort trying to fit into a beautiful landscape as gracefully as possible.',4
'Why wouldnt you love this cafe! Its charming intimate locally-owned and most importantly the food is phenomenal! I stopped by one recent Sunday after church and ate myself into a happy food coma. We decided to share the cinnamon stuffed french toast and silver dollar blueberry baked pancakes because we were told both were a must-try menu items! For some reason I thought silver dollar pancakes meant they were small but I soon learned that nothing at Wy-Knot Cafe is small!   I dont even know how to begin to describe the cinnamon stuffed french toast. Heaven in your mouth? Yes. Dessert for breakfast? Yes. Worth every single calorie and then some? A million times yes! The combination of the fluffy cinnamon french toast and the cream cheese stuffing is divine. The dish is huge and because each bite is so amazing its tempting to find it in your to gorge yourself and finish! I definitely ate more of the cinnamon stuffed french toast than the silver dollar pancakes but those were also very good! However the french toast trumped any other dish in my mind. The silver dollar blueberry pancakes were huge! The dish comes with three very large baked pancakes and so the meal was very much of a carbo-load...in a very good way! After all if you are going to consume the calories it might as well be worth it and this food was very much worth it.   We got lucky because when we went it wasnt very crowded. Therefore our food didnt take too long. However I did learn that they have a small kitchen so beware that if its busy in the cafe the food will take a little longer. But stick around because trust me its worth the wait!!!',5
'I guess they dont deliver every night. The first time I called they hung up on my. Dont think Ill be trying them after this.',1
'The 24 Hour Fitness Active club is a smaller facility than their Sport clubs - but a great place for a solid workout.  The location is very convenient for me which I think is one of the keys to a steady workout.  Lots of cardio equipment Im always able to get on the type of machine Im wanting (even on Monday nights which tend to be the busiest).  The weight machines tend to be underused I think with little waiting - the free weights tend to be busier but again very few traffic jams there either.  The staff is friendly and look like theyre helpful (Ive not utilized their training services nor needed support - except for changing channels on TVs!!).  Oh yea lots of TVs viewable from all the cardio equipment - great to get a good sweat going while watching a good game!!',4
'My mom and I met at the salon. We didnt have a lot of time so I asked when we came in if there was any wait for two pedicures. They said no wait and sat us down immediately. Someone started working on my mom right away but started her pedicure out by telling her they did not like the color she chose for her nails.  I thought this was odd but figured at least she was honest. 20 minutes later no one had come over to start my pedicure. I asked if I could soak my feet and they initially said no only said yes after I asked why... they didnt want my feet soaking for too long. hmmm.  Then they told me someone would be over in 3 minutes. 15 minutes later finally someone came over to me but by that time it was too late. I told her I had to be home in a half an hour and she said that the pedicures only should last 30 minutes anyway.  I ultimately did not get the pedicure.   The salon also smelled a lot stronger than most of polish/remover etc. It was a little uncomfortable.   Even though it is the closest place to my house I wont be going back.',1
'Went here with some girlfriends for happy hour one Friday night before watching a movie at ipic.  I had their signature champagne cocktail and I thought it was great - strong but tasty.  My friends got house champagne or rose for only $5.  We also sampled some of the crostini (they call them toasts) which were all tasty and I thought you got a lot for the price.  We loved the decor and atmosphere and our server was very sweet and friendly.  We had a good time but only stayed 30 minutes until the movie started.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it appeared to me that this place does turn into the typical Scottsdale club in the later evening.  With the ropes and loud music going we decided not to go back in after the movie.  To each his own but I really prefer a mellow wine bar or lounge where you can actually have a conversation with the person you are with and relax comfortably.  We ended up going to Kazimierz in Old Town instead.',3
'Good location just north of the quarter. Adam the assistant manager was very friendly and very helpful. He made some really good suggestions the tailor was professional and quick. I will definitely be back.',5
'The 4 stars are for the mechanics work. They do a really good job!   I cant give this place 5 stars because the service at the desk is an extreme hit or miss. Ive dealt with 2 different people inside the customer service area; 1 was really nice and helpful 1 was the exact opposite. Maybe he was having a bad day who knows but Id try them again simply because hes not the one handling my car :)',4
'Its a great weekend for all you foodies out there. Come on out to the Greek Festival this weekend Friday-Sunday. Ill be manning the grill tonight down by the beer garden so come hang out enjoy the music and stuff your faces with awesome Greek cuisine.',5
'Didnt go during happy hour but heres a review for the restaurant itself.  At first I sat inside with my lady but it was really too loud and too cold. Thats cool for me some nights but I wanted it quiet.  So we were seated outside where it was warmer and quieter and had some decent live music.  Staff was very friendly and food was good. Drinks were nice and strong so it was a good time!  Followed the suggestions and got some bruschetta. I would also recommend it!',4
'AWFUL!!!!!! I have NEVER received such terrible service in my LIFE. I cannot express to you just how important it is for you to go elsewhere. I spent $700 on a my sub zero ( which is fine if it were fixed) They had to come out 5 times to even diagnose what was wrong.. Also they would only give 4 hour chunks of time for when they would service.. that is WHEN they show up! Thats right they just no showed... after rearranging our work/kids schedules. When giving the owner Donna an opportunity to address the issue it was a joke. She took absolutely NO responsibility no remorse.. in fact she didnt even call me back or respond to voice mails. I have never been so insulted and disrespected by a business. Very unfortunate..',1
'Did you know that Marky Mark is the same person as Mark Wahlberg?  And why did I mention this?  Because that is what the three workers (one I know was a manager) were debating about while I was waiting for my sandwich...and sandwich that was waiting to be handed to me.  Five minutes later....my name was called....another employee gave it to me...while the three guys were still talking about Marky Mark.    I was told that I had to go to this amazing sandwich...the best sandwich in America.  Well...service wise...this place is awful.  The guy taking my order had severe ADD...(would you like a drink with that?  No thank you...ok would you like a regular or large drink?  Or!  What is the total?  Moron behind the counter...The cookie is $1.29)  Food wise?  There was nothing...absolutely NOTHING about that sandwich (Chicken Cheesesteak)  that would make me forget about the bad counter service so I would go back.  The chicken was bland and extremely greasy.  I am still feeling the effects of the pit in my stomach of bottomless grease.  Sorry Capriotis....not going back.',1
'We love Neds Krazy Subs!!! Not only are the samiches super tasty prepared of quality ingredients in many varieties or as you like it but they are also a great value prepared fresh served quickly and the staff is always friendly. We love eating in because of the neighborly atmosphere but you can also order on line and pick up in shop.  The most fun part is that - depending on the time of day - we can usually see Ned himself behind the counter or holding court in one of the booths...what a nice guy and what a friendly place to eat. Go...go now!',5
'This may be the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican food Ive ever had.  I found this place on Yelp after searching for Mexican restaurants in the Sunnyslope area and was expecting a lot after all the rave reviews. My boyfriend and I have been there for dinner twice now and attempted a third time but arrived too late because I forgot that they close at 8pm :( One of the only negative things about the place so far. I think they should stay open until at least 9PM but oh well.  Ive read numerous comments about poor service but both times Ive been service has been just fine. Maybe a little on the slow side regarding the check but I can let that slide as I was not in a hurry to leave either time. The ambiance is not romantic or necessarily inviting but its charming in its own way.  I found it a little strange that they charge for chips and salsa ($1) but its a small price to pay as the chips were very fresh and the salsa (both the salsa served with the chips and the bottled hot sauce) was quite good. I think both times Ive eaten at El Bravo I ordered the chicken chimichanga dinner special served with sour cream guacamole cheese tomato and rice and beans on the side. The chimichanga was AMAZING. Flavorful juicy tender shredded chicken and a very fresh and crispy flour tortilla. The toppings were a little overwhelming next time I may ask for them on the side. The rice and beans both had good flavor and I was very satisfied with the whole meal. I thought the little crispy flour tortilla with cinnamon sugar which was brought with the check was a very nice way to end the meal.  El Bravo is a little nondescript and can be easy to miss while looking for it but its totally worth it!',5
'Good dept store. Great selections of products. Weekly sales to make it interesting.',4
'Ive been coming here since they opened. If you want fresh good food and a good price for lunch or dinner this is the place to come. They have a small menu but what they make they make very well. They even have some sushi and it is double portion to what you would normally get somewhere else. There isnt any raw fish but their crunch roll and Vegas Roll are awesome and cheap.',4
'Food-awesome atmosphere-very cool service-just okay.  Had lunch today patio was busy however only two tables inside had customers.  There were three wait staff they just werent very attentive.  Happy hour until 630pm daily is a nice touch beer was ice cold!  Ill be back but hope for better service.....',4
'Some of the best Chinese food Ive had in Arizona. The first time I went I returned four more times that week with various friends. Its super affordable as well. The staff are very friendly and its a great place for larger groups to eat. Its also a good sign that it tends to be filled with Chinese people. I would definitely recommend to anyone.',5
'I actually like this place but today my experience was not good... why? well I cant believe the price of their bean and cheese is actually more than a beef one? ... on top the beans they added was probably equivalent to a scoop.. mostly toritlla.. what a rip off!  Once again I do enjoy their food but I better find me a more reasonably priced place.. or one that actually serves what you pay for..',3
'I was in Arizona this past weekend and my buddy was playing acoustic here.  How convenient!  He put me on the list and when I showed up the conversation with the door guy went something like this:  Me: Hi Im on Mike Jarmuzs guest list. (handing him my ID) Door Guy: (rudely) Who the hell is Mike Jarmuz? Me: Umm hes playing tonight. Door Guy: (rudely still) Yeah I dont know what band hes in. Me: Well hes his own act its just him. Door Guy: (now even ruder) Hes not on my list. Me: Are you sure? Let me take a look... ok hes Muzz.  Fair enough so I didnt know he went by his nickname but come on you dont gotta be a dick about it.  Anyway once inside we had a very good waitress.  Drinks were cheap and she recommended a great independent vodka as an alternative to the Ketel the girl I was with was going to order.',3

After 4 months of not being able to attend (schedule last minute changes etc) my group of 6 and I finally made it here.  The street eats Wednesday is every frugal foodies dream: a chance to try a $$$$ restaurant at a budget I can afford and really determine if I want to come back and spend my entire salary on a regular night here. It makes me feel fancy without having to be scared about my bank account later and you know late night food is always so damn delicious.   But yet here  I am being one of the few douches that is giving Posh a 3 star review. What about my experience could have possibly made this place just OK in my book? A combination of poor execution terrible service and unimpressive flavors.  Now not everything is terrible. I actually quite enjoyed my Goma Ramen served with an additional soft egg. Having the egg in the soup should not be an extra add on but an important component of the soup: opening the egg and letting the yolk flow out allows the broth to become creamier and elevate the entire flavors of the dish. The base broth of the Goma Ramen was pretty mild and tasty but the Shoyu broth literally tasted like watered down soy sauce: a dark water full of salt. My Goma had great pork belly pieces and the piece of pepper was crunchy  and a little spicy while the Bok Choy was waay overcooked and placed like a large piece impossible to eat even with my best chopstick skills. I enjoyed the thicker ramen noodles and I did not hesitate to add some squeezed limes to my soup regardless of my servers strong disagreement for my order.  Then Posh decided to inaugurate the internet-crazed new invention: the Ramen burger. For those of you unaware of the newest cronut replacement the ramen burger replaces the regular buns on a burger with cooked egg-added and fried-into-patties ramen noodles. At $15 we were all excited to give this craze a shot so much so that 4 of us got the burger and the remaining 3 stuck to the soup.  The famed Ramen burger was about the size of a large slider using a fried scallop in lieu of a beef patty. The concoction was served alongside a small potato salad which my friends were raving about. Unfortunately those 4 cooked pieces of potatoes were better than the star of the dish itself: the ramen buns were oily the scallop was overcooked and the thickness of it was not consistent between the diners at our table. The famous ramen burger fell short and left our peers ready to make a McDonalds run. I shared some of my ramen with them and that kept them content for the remainder of the evening.  Maybe harder to accept the fact that our pent up excitement about this place had died down was the sad realization that the service was below awful. We kept looking around for our server had to keep reminding him to bring us more water (about 4 times when we were lucky enough to see him near our table) and had to send our requests more than once before we could get it. I saw another server passed by and exchanged glances having her clearly see me and hear excuse me can we get some more water please?. She smiled back and kept walking. Hey Thanks. Even worse than that our soups came out but we had to wait about 5-10mins before the ramen burgers came out leaving our burger eaters there waiting while we already had our food. One burger didnt come out for 30mins. We later found out that it was because they had miscalculated the orders and had ran out of the prepped food to make his burger. Understandable mistake but maybe he should have told him as soon as the mistake was identified and not 30mins later when his food arrived (and we were already done eating ours). They didnt charge him for the burger thankfully as he didnt quite enjoy the taste of it when it finally came.  So is there any silver lining with Posh? Absolutely. Two of our peers have attended Posh on a regular night and truly loved it. Unfortunately their street eats disappointed and makes foodies like me worried about spending more cash at a place that fell so short from expectations.',2
'I have the menu memorized and still struggle every time I have to choose :)',5
'FRIENDLY FAST SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD. NEIGHBORHOOD FAVORITE.   --eggs overcooked --oj watery but tasty --food not greasy or oily --everything just a little bit healthier than youll find elsewhere.',2
'Love the Green Belt! Ive now lived on the very north end as well as the south end and its such a perfect trail for bike riding running or just a long walk.  On a personal quirky note I love that there are lots of landmarks I can use while running. You know Just make it to that bench and you can take a walk break or OK were gonna sprint until the end of that overpass! Sounds hokey but it makes me run longer and harder! Big points for a small time runner.  There is definitely lots of traffic all throughout the trail so stay aware of whats around you (dont blast the iPod up to 11) and stay on the right side of the path so you arent run over by bikes (or roller blading moms with strollers).   The only negative Ive ever found is that after a rain (or after the sprinklers come on) some parts can get muddy and smelly. But those spots are few and far between. I feel super luck to live right on the Green Belt. A desert gem for sure!',5
'Went yesterday for the first time and I had a really nice breakfast.    Had the Farmers Market pretty much a play on eggs benedict but with avocado and spinach so like eggs florentine with avocado? yeah?  The potateys werent piping hot which doesnt bother me at all...Id actually prefer them not to be.  It reminded me of my dad though something hed be all pissy about and want to send back to warm up....So if youre bringing a friend like that there beware.  The potatoes were really good though they werent all greasy and diner tasting they were as healthy as potatoes can get maybe? The farmers market was awesome though not greasy really light lots of flavor and a pretty presentation.  The hollandiase sauce was the perfect consistently not too thick and definitely not too thin and not drenched all over the place. The english muffin was the perfect texture..I hate when its a hard muffin and you cant cut it thats the worst. And lots of avocado... thank you!  People can be so stingy with the avocado....feelin you guys! The farmers market paired with my bellini a cutie patio my friends and the shins playing?  Id say we did pretty good.      Speaking of my bellini it was really refreshing and mostly champagne...feelin you again Ncounter/ bartender!  When it was dropped off she actually said lots of champagne in this one...I was definitely not mad about that.  And what I thought was fruit inside of it was actually a peach o ring like that!  And I ate it at the end definitely a champagne ring new fav?        My friends got the eggs benedict the fruit and granola some of their toast with their signature (not vignature...vig regulars whats up?) cinnamon apple jam? I think thats what type of jam it was..whatever type of jam it was delish.        My friends also really liked their food and the overall ambiance of a place seemingly reminiscent to LGO but over in the Tempe area.   Speaking of LGO...Ncounters food I think is better than LGOs.  There are very few things at LGO that have blown my mind its just nice to go there because its super cute a nice neighborhood something for everyone picnic tables...you know why we all like it.  Realistically I love going to LGO because its always a lovely time with my friends.  BUT I think Ncounter offered an awesome brunch with my friends and the food was better.          Ncounter will definitely be a new regs place for us... in fact Ill be back today? The salads that went by looked amazing.           Last thing that needs to be said....GET THE PUMPKIN COOKIE.  Holy fricken mother I think we all died and went to heaven eating that cookie.  I am not even kidding... if those were around me everyday...easily the fast track to morbid obesity.  This being said you should defs give Ncounter a try.',4
'Yummy yummy yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolinas for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it I promise you will thank me.    This place is streaming with professional business people police officers firemen construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.    The only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and buildings interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that adds to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolinas recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek same food but much nicer location.    As an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!',4
'As far as Subways go this one is pretty good.',4
'If you are in the area this is a great hidden delight The ingredients are the freshest I have had before the Lettuce tomatoes Onions etc are worth trying even if you do not normally care for them.',5
'Came here after eating Korean food for lunch and loved these paletas! I spent several summers in Mexico and had a daily paleta (fresh creamy/fruity popsicles) so I was thrilled to hear that we could get them in Chandler. Paletas Betty is in downtown Chandler right next to a bunch of gift shops bridal stores and some other restaurants. We did circle a bit before finding it.   The store itself is super clean and cute inside with all the different flavored popsicles laid out in the freezer. I got the Arroz con leche (like cinnamony rice pudding) paleta and my sister got the pecan popsicle each just $2.79. My other friends got a pineapple paleta and blackberry paleta. They didnt have strawberry paletas today unfortunately. I can tell the paletas are fresh and havent been in the freezer too long. My arroz con leche was yummy sweet and creamy. My sisters paleta had real pecans in it and the fruit paletas had real fruit in them too! The store also has a creative sticker wall where you peel off the popsicle label and stick it onto the wall. Kinda fun!  Next time Im trying the pear with cranberry!',4
'Great atmosphere and very good service. Sushi is yummy and well presented.',3
'I visited NYPD this past Saturday. I havent been here (or it may have been the other location back then) in years since I was a kid but had a craving for really good pizza and from what I remember this place has great pizza. So I came with three of my cousins. We knew it was Saturday night and would probably be busy but we went anyway. It was pretty busy so we were seated by the door which I didnt even care about since the place smelled so good. I was looking forward to getting some broccoli pizza (which very few places have) and Im sure that would have been great... if we ever got any service.  This was really upsetting. It was pretty busy that night so we waited 10 minutes without drink orders without complaining... and then 15 minutes.. about 20 minutes into our sit-in I notice that there were people cleaning the empty table next to ours and waiters standing around. Now that I think about it maybe they didnt even notice that we needed service. But nonetheless no one came and even asked if we wanted water. Eventually we just left and had to get food somewhere else.   Really disappointing.',2
'Here Friday nights could be noisy for you if you hate dance and music. Food is fresh and tasty. The PITA is AWESOME!',4
'Came here with the 4 for $40 deal where 4 people can share a family style pasta salad and bread.  Its a pretty good deal the catch is that none of the pasta dishes that you can choose from have meat so its pretty much a vegetarian meal.',4
'Im not impressed with this new location at all I guess disappointed would be the right word. Its in a nice area of Chandler with many new buildings going up so I had high hopes entering this store. Its beautiful inside. Spacious with newer more modern decor. Although the wait staff is nothing short of unskilled and unprofessional. THREE out of the four times i came the drive through was closed. Whats the point of a drive through if you never use it. I came in at 2pm on a Tuesday. There was one barista ringing in orders and a line of about four people ahead of me. She was one of the slowest cashiers ever the woman being serviced demanded a gift card for next time due to poor service. When it finally was my turn I ordered a mocha light frappacino with added whip cream. Thats not being too difficult is it? Apparently to the barista it was. As I waited for my drink the man ahead of me told here she forgot the cream in his coffee and he stood there for about five minutes because she had to get more half and half . Ugh. He was visually upset too. Then when my drink was served it was a coffee frappacino! I told her my order once again and she made me a mocha light frappacino and for got the added whip. Whatever I give up and leave. Even though this location is convenient...its not worth the headache.',2
'I went to this place with a groupon the other day.  I havent tried many of the places in this plaza so I figured Id give it a shot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It has kind of a intimate atmosphere; not too big with a bar right in the middle with low lights.  I see why they call it a Steak Bar.  They had some nice specials during the week like 50% off bottles of wine on Wednesday which was a nice change.  I got the marinated rib-eye which delicious.  I never order marinated steaks either but I figured Id try something different for once.  The flavor was very nice and the steak had a great char on it and was cooked exactly how I ordered it.  The baked potato was also good and nice that you didnt have to pay for ala carte sides.  The GF got the sliced sirloin steak which was also very good.  Oddly they really didnt ask how she wanted it done and it was on the rarer side of medium.  I thought that was interesting so I figured Id warn people.  But really I shouldnt have to if youre thinking maybe you want it well done DERP!  I cook a lot of steaks and when people want them over cooked and then complain about them being tough it makes me  crazy.  Back on topic we ordered some potato popper things that were awesome for an appetizer.  I would definitely go back to this place again.  It is a nice spot in Chandler thats not really low end or crazy expensive.  Id definitely go here again over Flemings.',4
'Their online my portfolio is the best in the business. All other banks request switching but none can compare to BofA online.. and they know it.',4
'This was my first time at the Vig - havent been to the original yet either.  We met some friends for brunch.  Not bad.  The food was a little more out of the box than we expected but good.  They easily and happily made a couple minimal substitutions (not ready for chicken and eggs for breakfast) and the server was very nice.  Its interesting how they turned the old bank into a restaurant.  Love the natural light coming in over the bocce ball court.  Would have loved to play bocce ball but there were kids everywhere playing with the balls.  Its a little loud inside but not deafening.  Its definitely not a place I would frequent - seemed a little cold - but no regrets on checking it out.',3
'Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!',3
'I hate to admit it but I like 5 guys better than In-n-Out.  Im a Cali native and grew up on In-n-Out and I wanted nothing more than to say that 5 guys sucked and didnt compare.  Even though it is way over priced the burgers are awesome and the fries are dope.',4
'I love Mongolian bbq not really impressed with this place.  YCs is much better...',3
'In a single word?  Disappointing.      over priced     low quality food     poor slow service with an attitude...   We got there at 8 and there were 7 wait staff 4 cooks in the kitchen at least 2 bartenders.  There were less than 8 tables occupied each with 3 or less people.  We were seated promptly and nicely and within a min or two a girl came and took a drink order.  Thats where the good stopped.  15 min later when the waiter stopped by to ask if everything was alright (our order had been taken but not yet delivered and we still didnt have our drinks) I smiled and nicely said: Yes thanks!  Do you mind checking on our cocktails? his reply was a brief sneer and Sure well Im kinda like the only one here right now...   The manager who seated us was at the table right behind him doing paperwork... and again plenty of people working mostly just standing around.  It took another 5 min before our drinks came.  When the drink order was taken they asked if we wanted a Double for $2 more meaning a double shot.  We ordered one double and one regular since one of us was driving.  Both drinks were watered down mine was weak and hers tasted exactly the same even though it was supposed to be a double.  I ordered the Howie burger that comes with caramelized onions.  She ordered fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  My burger was ordered medium it came well done.  The onions were not caramelized not even a little but did look and taste soaked in oil and maybe tossed in a pan for a brief moment.  They were also red onions Ive never heard of using red onions for caramelized onions.  Her Fried chicken had obviously been pre-prepared then chilled and re-heated when we ordered it.  The mashed potatoes were instant powdered potatoes not even nice ones and werent even thoroughly mixed.  You could see and taste the lumps.  Overall it left a very distinct impression that the only thing they put any effort into was the design and layout of the place which does look quite nice.  Everything else made it very clear that the staff feel entitled to charge inflated prices for poor service low quality food will cut corners and just expect to get away with it since it is in an airport. The tab came to over $60 for two entrees and two drinks.  I was truly surprised by how disappointing it was based on other reviews and  on their reputation for their other location.  Perhaps we arrived at a shift change perhaps they had run out of some items and had to improvise.  Either way if too many people have an experience like ours I doubt they will make it.  Again put simply?  Very disappointed.',1
'Ive been eating here since they opened! Amazing fresh veggies and great flavors. If you master filling your bowl correctly you can eat and take home even more for later. Gotta love having control over every aspect of your meal. The staff are helpful if you are a first timer so just ask. I love love love YCs!',5
'Panel change out. I checked with several contractors and the prices ranged from $3600 to $1300. EE was not the lowest bid (but almost). I liked they were licensed bonded and insured and a member of the BBB. Changing a panel is not rocket science but they did it right took about 3 hours the rest of the day was spent waiting for the City of Phoenix to earn their permit fee - at least when I pay my doctor $150 I get an appointment-and of course SRP to re-energize the system.. A four hour job wound up being all day- not always the case just be warned.  I had good communications with Tamira they kept me up-to-date and even filed the permit for me at no extra charge. Even had Greg add a dedicated circuit while they were waiting around!',4
'Had lunch for the first time here and the chopped salad was great! Fun atmosphere with seating on the outdoor patio and many options inside. Great bar at the center of the room! Recently transplanted from San Francisco-the food was as good as the City and nice casual atmosphere. The wait service was excellent! Will definitely be going back to try some other dishes on the menu!',4
'Great happy hour! The chalupas were huge and delish. Their carnitas street tacos were succulent and flavorful.  Service was impeccable as well.',5
'Where do I even begin?  My experience with Mariee was almost to amazing to put into words.    I got married last Saturday in a Watters Lasara gown that I purchased at Mariee.  When I saw the gown online I fell in love immediately.  Only problem was that is was a brand new gown from the Watters Spring 2010 collection and no where in the valley carried it yet; except Mariee.  So I scheduled an appointment and went to try the dress on (and a few others).  The owner Susan was extremely friendly and very helpful in helping me select the right dress.  So helpful and friendly that I decided to order all 10 of my bridesmaids dresses through Mariee as well.  Best decision I ever made!    As you can imagine having two handfuls of bridesmaids can get kind of messy at times so there were definitely a few obstacles to overcome during my experience with Mariee.  HOWEVER... the general manager Amanda (who could be compared only to wedding dress fairy godmother) handled each issue with such ease and professionalism.  I really dont know what I would have done without her.  Between the bridesmaids dress ordered so late it might not have come in on time to the bridesmaid who ordered her dress a size smaller and didnt fit in it Amanda tackled all the problems with such voracity that youd think they were her fault (which they werent).     Thank you so much ladies for outfitting myself and my girls and making it so much fun to work with you!    I would recommend Mariee to any bride looking for a fabulous gown and stellar customer service.',5
'A Five Star miss.  This place has the opportunity to be a 5 star destination but they need to step up the customer service. I wanted to try iPic for the very first time so  I started with Yelp and the reviews looked promising.  I noticed they said they had Happy Hour listed as YES so I went to the Salt Lounge site to find out more information.  The site was pretty but it told me very little other than stating The Ultimate Happy Hour that looked GREAT but it said nothing more so I made a phone call to see what was so Ultimate about their Happy Hour.     My call went directly to a recorded message that put me on hold and after waiting about 3 minutes it went to a recording saying they were busy and to leave a message or remain on hold I went through this for 4 rotations and no answer so I decided to leave a message.  (by the way this was around 4PM yesterday).   A call was made back to me and they left a message on my voice mail.  The message said that the only Happy Hour they have is for members only and is on Tuesday only.  That does not sound like an Ultimate Happy Hour to me how about to you?  I do not like false advertising.  I decided to go anyway and my wife and I head out for a 4:55PM show.  The tickets were purchased online and at a cost of $16 for a self service seat it was a little pricey.    We went to the Salt Lounge for cocktails and waited some time until approached.  The bar tenders and servers were plentiful but it seemed like they did not have time for the customers they were busy conversing with each other.  The bartender was very pleasant once she did approach us and we enjoyed our drinks.    The theater was relatively empty and it is a weekend in the middle of our high season so that concerns me. In order to fill these theaters they will need to make it more affordable and even more than that have excellent service.  I feel that for $16 a seat they should be able to provide service to my seat and it will also help them increase sales.     Overall this experience was nice but it can be SO MUCH BETTER.',3
'Gross microwaved food slow service cheap salsa beans are watery mess. Bean dip is awfull.  Much better places then this place go somewhere else for mexican taco bell would be better.',1
'Of all the Spring Training ballparks I have been to in the Cactus League this is my absolute favourite ballpark. Why? Well first of all because both my favourite teams in the National League play at this park so I get the best of both worlds between the Colorado Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks. The atmosphere and ambience of this ballpark is the best. This park has many amenities to offer the baseball fan including many different food and beverage offerings a team shop for souvenirs from both teams practice fields to watch the team workouts at etc. There are three different areas to enter the park in and also to park. Parking costs $5 at this ballpark.   Spring Training is the best time to meet your favourite players and that is also when they are the most accessible so take advantage of it.',5
'Yuck.   Pho is rather tasteless there is no pho-fragrance and they use the wrong noodles. Its pho not pad thai.  Stir fries use anti-fresh vegetables and if it doesnt come out of a can they dont use it.  Stay away from here.   I will however be returning because Grandma thinks this place is amazing and I really think its because of the owner. Hes from the Motherland and she just loves that. It doesnt mean he can cook the food well but sometimes we just suck it up and go along for the people we love (and the people they love too).',1
'The old girl is showing her age but still a great value. The grounds are beautiful and the staff is great.   Our room was nice but showing its age with chipped countertops etc.',4
'Business takes me downtown a few times a month. I had never been here before but thought I would try it for lunch today. Had a burger which was pretty pedestrian. Fries were cold. I would have said something to the waitress but never saw her again. Service was pretty bad the hostess who seats you seemed pissed that customers where there. Probably wont return.',2
'Have to give one star to post but doesn deserve that high a rating. Avoid this dealership for service. I placed three calls to the service department with no return calls. Obviously they are not in need of business. Was completely satisfied with service by Larry Miller Hyundai in Peoria. Will use that service from now on.',1
'This place is awful!  Upon entry the cashier tried to cheat me wanting the dinner price when it was nowhere near the dinner time posted on the wall.  She finally let me in at the posted price.  The couple who came in after me & sat near my table argued the whole time I was there because she had allowed the cashier to cheat them & the guy was having a fit about it!  There wasnt a bit of service available nor a drop of regular water to drink as soda water came out of both water taps on the soda fountain.  Avoid this place at all costs!  If youre hungry for something right now go around the other side of the building to King Wah Buffet.  Its pretty bad (* *) but its worlds above this place.  Better yet drive 3 miles west to Jumbo Buffet (* * * *) at 3414 W. Southern & enjoy a good meal!',1
'Toasted coconut with salted carmel. Do it! Thats all I am going to say. Oh and the Macaroons!',5
'I love this place I have been going for years and I go every 2 weeks or so for a little pampering They are reasonably priced. And I love that if I dont go for awhile that I ca.just walk in and they remember me and its like I never left. I love the new additions they have made to their services and so do all the friends that I have changed over :-) couldnt ask for a better place to go and get pampered so close to home Thank you TUBI NAILS',5
'I ate here a while back and walked away full. We had overpriced salads and hamburgers that were large and filling and tasted decent. This place is great for tourists staying downtown or going to an event but there are so many better local places you could choose from. The martinis were $15 but you got to keep the glass and they were not strong. The service was good but all in all this is just another chain that charges high prices for low quality food. do yourself a favor and go someplace else.',2
'Like a moth to a flame I totally fall for gimmicky stuff all the time. This is no exception. I absolutely adore having my sushi travel around on a mini conveyor belt.   At places like these Ive learned that the sushi tends to be fresher when the restaurant is crowded because the chefs constantly have to replenish the sushi thats been taken off the conveyor belt and Im not sure what the turn around time is before the sushi is removed (Im sure theres some secret protocol in place). At noon the place was boomin!   Sushi Station had quite the variety of rolls. Unagi avocado rolls tempura rolls Imagine rolls and Tiger rolls whizzed by on the belt but by the time I read the description I had to wait for them to make their rounds before they made their way back to me again. I just was so mesmerized by the movement though that I was in a trance instead of deciding whether I wanted the roll or not. At similar mobile sushi places usually theres a sticker dot that indicates the price of the sushi and based on dot color or number of dots you could tell how much each plate is. Here there are petite signs that lead each set of rolls out so youre never confused what each roll is. I like how easy each name was displayed here on clear neat signs.  There was nigiri also present: maguro (tuna) shake (salmon) seared tuna and tamago. There was also desserts like carrot cake tiramisu and jello traveling around.  In case the food on the conveyor belt wasnt what you were jonesing for they also have a regular menu booklet you could flip through and order directly from. I didnt even bother with this because it wasnt as fun. What a short attention span I have!  Overall sushi was pretty good for what it was worth. My friend and I walked out paying $23 total including tax. Normally at fancier sushi restaurants that would have gotten us two specialty rolls (if that) without drinks. I really like this place. I get my sushi fix while still on a budget and the atmosphere is interactive and fun in itself!',3
'Even though they dont serve Sake they do a great job as a bring your own place. The location is small so if you have a large group you might have to wait a little while to be seated. Its definitely worth it though.   As I look at the reviews of other Yelpers I cant help but think that theyre just ordering the wrong things. I mean good sushi is about good fish. It really kind of bothers me when people say I love sushi and then either pick the fish off the roll order something without fish entirely or order something thats going to be drenched in some American sauce.   The waiters have always been really knowledgeable and educated about the flavor profiles of their fish and are usually really good about letting you know what is going to be best that day and what is the freshest.   I have yet to find a sushi place in Phoenix that has fish as good as theirs its not the best but its the best Ive had in the valley. And I dont know what Jenn H. (review below) ordered to get something covered in mayo? We always get a variety of different things and I have yet to have anything with any weird sauce on it.  I mean Ive probably been there 5 or 6 times and I cant remember any sauce on anything. When my dad and stepmom came to visit from L.A. they liked this place so much that they actually wanted to go two nights in a row.',4
'Their boba drinks are good.  The Thai iced tea is good too.  The snacks they serve there are actually better than the drinks.   Your order always comes out in a timely manner even when its busy.  My only complaint is that not everything on the wall menu is available..  They need to update it because Im one of those people that are into the items that they no longer serve.',4
'I hate going to this pharmacy late at night since there is never anyone working at the front they have this incredibly loud and annoying buzzer go off whenever someone comes into the store. Then it proceeds to go off every single time someone walks through that door. However I would like to add that service is friendly!',3
'Talk about a well-run business.  This is the type of jewelry store that you walk into and just feel welcome.  Their staff is more than knowledgeable on every single product that they have available.  My parents have been customers for sometime now and I myself have now become a customer.  They will take care of you for years to come from the very minute that they walk in there.  My family always deals with Lyndell when we go there and what a pleasant guy to talk to.  He certainly knows his stuff and will be more than happy to answer any questions that you have.  He made certain to even do the simple things such as give me extra cleaning cloths so that my purchase always looks in tip-top shape.  This is a place where you certainly will be taken care of and nothing will be forgotten.',5
'Some people mistakenly said on yelp that they have delivery service but they never delivered. Its ok! Its worth the drive and the food tastes best there when it is freshly cooked anyway. Sesame chicken is awesome! The express combos are great and prices are very reasonable. Its a place for people who care about food qualities more than the atmosphere.',5
'Excited I remembered that this place opened soon I stopped in for Indian fast-food.  I ordered Chole with 1/2 rice portion 1/2 naan.  The gentleman who took my order forgot to give me my change and after I told him he gave me my dollar back in dimes. I waited approx. 15 minutes for my fast-food.  The Chole was OK the rice was rice and the naan was great.  Like the first reviewer I didnt think the value was that great.  Im no pig but even I couldve had more.  When I go back Ill have to get the big plate (full serving of rice & whole piece of naan) but then were talking $9+.  A bit much for fast-food.  I will go back though.  They just opened and I dont want a food option like this to go away without a chance.',3
'Great venue with an atmosphere that is low key. Good place to unwind and have some wine. Nice on the wallet. very unique music talent. You can get flights of wine and try a variety of the large varietys they have.',4
'I wont hesitate to call Casa Reynoso the best Mexican Food in Arizona. My orders are always delicious and I am a long-time customer. My favorite dishes are their tacos bean burritos and green chile. As far as sides go the rice and beans are outstanding.  Along with their excellent food their service is top notch. If you enjoy Mexican food you need to give this place a try!  P.S. Dont forget to order a cheese crisp!',5
'I cannot express how awful my experience was here.   I came in a few weeks ago to get my fingerprints taken for a teaching program at school. When I arrived I immediately grabbed a ticket (time 11:14am) After filling out a short form I waited until 1:35pm (the time stamp on my receipt)  until my number was FINALLY called. I swear it felt like I won the lottery. So after telling the young lady behind the window that I needed to get fingerprinted for my teaching program at school she told me that my total would come to $6. That was shockingly low so I asked its only $6 to get my fingerprint clearance card? She responded with yes. She then asked for my fingerprint form ID and the $6. I payed. Sat down and waited for about five min until my name was called. The nice girl made small talk and quickly took my fingerprints. After I wiped the ink off my hands she handed me back the form with my fingerprints on it. I thought this was odd so I asked so this is my fingerprint clearance card? This is all I need? She replied with yep thats it! Easy as that. I then left to enjoy some lunch. A few days later I took the finger print card to the school Im attending and this is when they informed me that this is the wrong card.... (This is when I knew it was about to get nasty.) They provided me with a blue envelope with a few forms I needed to fill out then take back  to this location and have them mail the fingerprints for me. After that I would receive a different card... which is the card I need (The verified prints).   So again I headed back to this inconvenient location (hard to find if you have never been here). I filled out the forms in the blue envelope grabbed a number then headed to the information window. I informed the officer of my problem... He then explained that because I didnt come back the day after that there may be an issue with the date and I may have to get re-fingerprinted but he was going to check with the supervisor.(Getting annoyed....) I handed him my ID a receipt for the original fingerprints and the actual fingerprint form. He told me to take a seat and he would see what he could do. I sat down and shortly after he came out and sat down next to me. He explained that because the fingerprints left the building  I was going to have to get re-fingerprinted and that I also needed a cashiers check for $67 to get the Identity Verified Prints he said read this form and it will have everything you need to know. I then expressed my understanding of his reason and asked him if I was going to have to pay another fee for the actual prints ($6). He said yes. This is when I asked him to speak with the supervisor. He relied with I have already spoken with her and this is what she said so your not going to get anywhere with her. I then told the officer Id prefer to speak with the supervisor in person. He continued to repeat that I was not going to get anywhere with her. Feeling beyond frustrated I left the facility ran to the bank to get a cashiers check and quickly arrived back in the waiting area with 8 people in front of me. (Oh ps. The form says you need a check for $69 and the officer told me $67) Waiting for my number to be called was like sitting on a barbed wire... All I wanted to do was get up and scream bloody murder. Finally my number was called and I approached window number five the nice young girl behind the counter asked what I needed I told her (now knowing) the verified fingerprint card she took my blue envelope with the check for $67 my ID and entered my information into the computer then gave me a total of $6. I payed then immediately asked for the supervisor. The supervisor Dina came over and I asked her for a number or email address where I could file a complaint. She proceeded to write down a number and hand it over to me. Not once did she ask what the problem was or if she could help in anyway. Weird... isnt that part of your job description? With no questions asked she just walked away as if the problem was solved.  I again waited for my name to be called so I could get fingerprinted for the second time. Thank god the technician working Vanessa was a breath of fresh air. She was super sweet and very friendly... honestly she was the ONLY pleasant thing about my experience. Keep up the good work Vanessa!!  I know its only $6 and its not the money part that gets me but the fact they didnt offer to waive the fee. Nor did the supervisor try what so ever to resolve the issue or even seem interested in addressing the needs of a customer. I dont care who needs what or when but if your a customer you deserve good customer service. Period.   If you can get ur prints done at a different location I highly recommend it.  **Side note. I did call back later that day to file a complaint. I spoke with Dina and she took the time to listen to my complaint and apologized for my unpleasant visit. Hopefully they work on how to better their customer service.',1
'I love their seared Ahi.  Good place to go if you have a group.   Its cool to sit out on the balcony and people watch on Mill.',3
'DO NOT use this rental company!  I wasnt even asked about getting the insurance and yet I found when I got home they automatically added it anyway.  Also we filled the car up about 3 miles away before returning it and were charged 10 bucks for not having a paper receipt which they failed to mention when they were all too happy to tell you to make sure you fill it up within 10 miles.  Will NOT use them again.',1
'Great desert golf course that plays tough...bring a lot of balls because if you miss the fairway youre going in the desert.  Sanctuary is a very nice course with great views that is resonably priced. However watch out for wildlife especially rattlesnakes.',4
'This is a great little casual restaurant located south of Warner on Gilbert Road.  Weve had the gyros philly cheesesteaks gyro salad falafels greek fries lentil soup.  Excellent food every time.  Service and a sincerely friendly staff makes this a  go to place.  A bonus is that they offer a dinner all-you-can-eat buffet for a very reasonable price.  Great way to try many of their menu options.  I think they offer the buffet for lunch on weekends but better call the restaurant to confirm.  Its a clean fresh restaurant with a nice atmosphere to boot!  One of our new faves!',5
'Cute casual cafe. Good food though they forgot to bring me my soy ice cream at the end of my meal. Interesting car parts on the wall.',4
'My family and I are in town visiting and we happened to find Albertos. It was the best dinner any of us had in a long time. Authentic Italian friendly service keen attention to detail.',4
'Ive been here a few times.  A couple times when they first opened and just the other day.  Was looking for a good burger.  I had their summer ale.  Light and refreshing but had more flavor than the Kolsch they offered.  Happy hour so $3.25 for a pint. Mmmm.... also ordered the bavarian pretzels... around $6.00.  Was hoping to have some homemade style pretzels but alas they did the big no-no and served SUPER PRETZEL sigh.  Why Four Peaks why?  Dont get me wrong I LOVE-LOVE-LOVE superpretzels but just expected more from a place that handcrafts their own beer.  With that being said the pretzels were hot and yummy and served with a side with possibly beaver brand mustard...YUM.  The mustard was the best part.  If I went back I definitely wouldnt be opposed to ordering them again.    My hubby got the cheeseburger.  Their bun looks partially like a wheat bun--- not opposed at all as it was light and had a nice glossy eggwash to the top.  Not your standard aunt hatties sesame style bun (good for you 4 peaks).  Service was good for a Sunday afternoon.  Got to try several samples and they brought them quick.  The overall experience was good.',3
'YUMMMM  this is the food of my dreams. Im a vegetarian so its hard to find places that are meat free as well as tofu and mushy eggplant free. This place hit the spot.  Cauliflower soup... omg. Delicious. I talk about it still. I had the strawberry salad and soup combo. It was an easy 8 bucks. My sister and Mom had some other stuff I was way too proccupied with my delicious soup to give notice. And it came with a dipped strawberry. heaven.  Is this place a chain? It is such a good chain if it is. Everything was great. My only complaint is that theyre closed on Sundays. I hate establishments that are closed on Sundays I think its dumb. I drove my whole family here one Sunday afternoon all excited to introduce my husband to the delicious selection and they were closed. ugh. Were going tomorrow. Maybe that will ease my bitterness of the Sunday thing and cause an extra star to be added.. we will see.',4
'Awesome! Do not hesitate to come here. Great beer and great food. This place really makes the dining options in Verrado more well-rounded now...I would like to see more vegan options on the menu here but for now I will stick to the Black Bean Burger as it is delicious. Staff was very courteous and professional atmosphere is great. Thank you Ground Control for giving us somewhere great to spend our weekend nights without it involving a 45 minute car ride. We will be back again and again!',5
'Went to the Claim Jumper yesterday to check out their happy hour.  Ive dined there before and the food is decent. ***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged menus finally arrive drink orders are placed (I get a glass of wine my dining partner gets a coke) we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still havent ordered.  At this point Im getting the hungry cranky pains and the irritability is setting in...Drink the wine calm down...  Finally the waitress comes back to take our order (bringing another coke and he hasnt even finished half of the first).. We order the shrimp taquitos and crab cakes. After another grueling 15 minutes our order arrives (with another coke). The taquitos are a shrimp (tail intact) wrapped in a corn chip and fried they serve the 4 with some slimy sweet sauce and a poor excuse for dressed up tartar sauce. The crab cake (not cakes) comes out and it was pretty delicious but at $10.95 it better have been. Heres the skinny on the crab cakes $12.95 for 2 the happy hour special takes 2 dollars off any app on the menu knocking it down to $10.95 - what they dont tell you is they take away the other crab cake! Cheeky rip off!  Still being hungry we order the nachos Ill post a picture later just to show how gross they were. The guacamole was brown I think they added it prior to baking. The nachos which consisted of cheese and black beans. They were so soggy I dont think they drained the beans before piling them on. Also the menu boasted of an array of different salsas there were 2 jars they were both the same salsa.  Bill came (with another coke) - $30 bucks I went home and made a sandwich.',2
'I am a little disappointed  I drove all the way to Essence to try the Macarons.  I have been to France several times and being a pastry and sweets lover I would stop by several Patisseries and stock up with goodies for my train ride.  The macarons at Essence seem a little too chewy maybe because they have so much sugar.  A macaron is basically eggs whites ground almonds and sugar.  If there is too much sugar it is not going to be as crispy and flaky.  They also seem to have too much cream in the middle.  I had the caramel and the vanilla.  My husband had the chocolate and the mocha.  From the 4 choices vanilla was by far the best.  The chocolate was go sticky and chewy even my husband couldnt finish it and he doesnt usually leave a dessert.  Maybe this is good for my waist line.',3
'I wanted to like this place since it is so close to my house.  Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed with the quality of the cupcakes.  I bought a variety to try them out.  First and foremost there is WAY WAY WAY too much frosting on these cupcakes.  So much that it was gross - I like sweets but wow - this would put you in a diabetic coma even if you dont have diabetes!!  There was at least 4 times more frosting than cupcake.   The actual cake is so small - like half a cupcake - and not very good.  I have had better cupcakes from a box that I make at home.  One of the cupcakes was also old and stale - it was the last one left of this flavor and I should have known better than to purchase it.  The salesperson should NOT have sold this cupcake either and she had to have known it had been there a while - and she sold it to me anyway - I am sure just to get rid of it.  I will say the marketing of GiGis is very clever and the packaging and presentation is really cool as well - but I want to eat and enjoy a cupcake not just look at how pretty and cool it looks.  Not worth $3.50 each and I will not be back.',1
'Yummy frozen yogurt and lots of fun toppings to choose from.    I had sticker shock when the bill for 4 yogurts rang up at $25!!!  I was a bit disappointed that you have to pay 50 cents extra for whip cream and then they put in on before weighing your cup.  Feel like I am double paying for it.  We went back again with the kids report cards so they could get a free yogurt up to $2.50.  Two of my kids had super small ones and my sons was just small.  I ended up having to pay a buck and some change for my sons.  Looking forward to going in PJs on a Wednesday night for 1/2 off.  That might make it more reasonably priced.',4
'Setting:  Very small quaint place.  Seating are all located outside.  Nice area with parking lot which is a plus.  Very clean.  Food:  Very yummy.  We tried all their sandwiches and they were all good.  I especially liked the tuna...highly recommended.  And all the drinks are unique.  Service:  We came practically at closing time.  They only had a few breads left and they accommodated our group of 6 just fine.  Very nice folks.',4
'I was not feeling very well when I was at this TJs. However the staff was exceptionally friendly and helped me find everything I needed! The prices are average for TJs but it is all quality ingredients.',4
'I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.  I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send well we dont have anymore of that one.  Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. Im over you being cooler than me but Im not over you having no soul.',1
'I am very happy to say that Brothers Pizza is trying to make things right by giving West Wing School $200 from the fundraiser fiasco.  Lessons learned... better communication is the key.',2
'This place has the charm and authenticity of Los Sombreros but the prices and comfort of El Bravo. The ingredients were fresh and tasty and the dishes themselves were traditional but oh-so perfectly original.   The chips they brought to the table were still warm and obviously cooked in house. The salsa rested comfortably in the range of spicy but not too spicy and bursted with flavor.   Mucho Gusto is perfect for the Mexican food purist or out-of-towner that has never experienced true south of the border flavor. It has been selected as Best of Phoenix by the New Times and after checking it out its clearly well deserved.',5
'Yummy food! I love the mac-n-cheese the grilled cheese their chips and their tomato soup which is THE BEST! Everything here is always delicious! The staff is very friendly! Highly recommended!',5
'Love this HomeGoods. It was probably the best and nicest HomeGoods I have been to in a while. The employees were super nice and helpful which I liked. I came in looking for certain things and left with what I wanted and even more things! The clearance section was huge here! Great selections and a wide variety of things which was awesome since I love going down sale and clearance isles! The store is really big and packed with stuff down the isles which is awesome because you always will probably end up leaving with more than you expected!',5
'Ive been to other OPHs but this one is my favorite.  Ron (the owner?) is an awfully nice fella and when he stops in to chat with you you get that warm fuzzy small-town vibe.  As others have pointed out on the weekends the wait is super long -- which should tell you something but if you are just a party of 2 you can skip the line and hit the small counter bar -- its first come first serve.  As for the food with a name like original pancake house the pancakes are about what youd expect -- nothing short of perfect.  But dont underestimate other menu choices -- my mother a chef said they made the best omelette of her life.  Seriously.  At *this* place.  And the coup de grâce? Order the bacon cheddar grits on the side to share.  The best grits youll ever eat.  My only gripe sometimes is the wait staff is a little shaky.  I recognize they are super busy and this is a hole in the wall but sometimes I dont feel the love ...  sometimes.',4
'Ryan Riek/Jewelry Replacement Source put together a unique custom-made ring created by the famed jeweler he works with. My ring features a top quality diamond that Im proud to wear. Ryan spent hours searching for the exact diamond I requested at a price I was willing to pay; he gave me many many options to choose from without sales pressure phony deadlines or attempts to change my mind. He stayed in touch with me the exact amount I wanted he respected my time and attention. Ryan has access to the same diamonds including fancy shapes and colors all the famous jewelers/brands do but he has less overhead and branding costs to support. I look forward to creating future jewels with Ryan/Jewelry Replacement Source.',5
'Went here late the other night to get a bite to eat...I thought this place was open 24hours...I was wrong got kicked out at 3am...not quite kicked out but the manager kept hinting that we would have to go soon.  Would not suggest eating here...the service was OK except the waitress got my order wrong. In general the restaurant was clean.  I got the turkey club sandwich...it was quite stale and did not taste very good the seasoned fries were OK my date for the evening got a salad...what else is new right...anyhow she ate it all so it must have been OK.  I have experienced better not very impressed with this location.',2
'parking is meter street garage or paid lot.  French Fries are really good and decent sandwiches. Good place to go when youre downtown.',3
'This place is dope.  A really fun place to have drinks and grab a bite to eat.  I got the hot vings at happy hour ordered two because thats how I roll ha.  We drank and ate and had fun inside and out.    Plenty of new faces to keep your people watching at bay and with good company this place has a great vibe.  Enjoyed it before we out that night...Vhumbs up!',4
'DRAB BLAH & SMELLY =================== I like Doubletree Hotels & Resorts and am a Hilton HHonors Diamond member (highest tier). This Doubletree property looks and is dated. My room 7211 was on the second floor and when I opened the door it smelled like a dirty baby diaper (nappy). I actually looked in to the closet and the trash cans to see if there was a diaper left behind but alas there was none to be found. I ten took off my shoes and the carpet felt damp. Ugh! Its a moldy smell in the this room and not a dirty diaper.   While this Doubletree location has large grounds a pool tennis courts and a nicely equipped gym the rooms leave something to be desired.   I actually stayed here twice before this year and both stays were just okay and nothing more. My second stay here consisted of my forgetting something in the room. It took two days and five calls to the hotel to get someone to call me back to help me find my lost item. By then it wouldve been too late to find it anyway.   So I guess Id have to revise my thoughts on this place and say that you should stay elsewhere. Actually the Doubletree Phoenix hotel at Phoenix airport has great service provides nice amenities and a free full breakfast buffet. I like it there much more and will move my business stays to that location.',3
'Could not recommend them more  Since my last review we had our 14-year-old Shepherd/Grayhound mix pass away. She lost lower body control experienced seizures and couldnt potty or eat.  We eventually had to make the decision to euthanize after watching her struggle so much one weekend.  The vet and his crew were amazingly kind and considerate. The emphasis was on making Chloie comfortable.  Our 13-year-old Cocker Spaniel who was dealing with liver failure stopped eating much directly after.  Working with the vet we made her as comfortable as possible and spent a good amount of time playing a little and cuddling.  She just seemed to miss her sister too much and would lay in Chloies spot and sniff around for her.  Malie died peacefully one morning about two months later.  Again the PVAC was supportive throughout-- meds to take away pain and keep some weight on helped us take care of the body no crazy procedures with little chance of success and sent us a condolence card afterward.  So in two months we saw a world of compassion from Palm Calley Animal Clinic.  Animals and their families are respected in every way.  We were lucky to have found them.',5
'I took the lady here for our 1yr anniversary after hearing good things about it. She actually wanted to go to the Melting Pot since that was where we had our first date at - but hey Im the man here right? And I say that we are trying something new!  Entering the door and going through the kitchen is different... and weird. If I hadnt read about it here on Yelp then I would have thought I walked in the wrong door. The girlfriend swore I was lying and we actually did come in the wrong way. Even after seeing people come and go through the kitchen she was still skeptical! LOL. It is a nice touch though - my comment was it makes it a bit harder to spit in your food with cusomers walking through all the time huh?  I know the way I think of things is weird.  The garlic bread was good. I generally dont like a bunch of crap on my bread but I actually really enjoyed this break. I could have made a whole meal out of it (Ive heard that from others).  The taters were good as was the steak. The searing+flavoring was phenominal on both her Filet Mignon and my New York. It was probably one of the better flavorings Ive had on a steak to be honest.  I actually undervalued the bill too. I figured Id be hit with a Delmonicos (Vegas) tab but it wasnt so bad. Service was good too - I drink a lot and my water glass was never empty. My alcholic drink (Long Island) was also good as well as whatever fruity drink she had. Not too alcoholic but still very tasty on both drinks.',5
'Sanwiches are good except the bread is horrible.  It always tastes stale.  Bad bread ruins a sandwich even if everything in the sandwich is good.',2
'The First Second Saturday went very well.  They had almost 100 local artists.  I was most impressed with the fact that there were only a couple that were more craft than art.  The art was unique and very interesting.  They were supposed to have music in 4 different locations.  Only one of those locations Grinders  was successfully playing continuous music from 5pm til I left around 8.  They rotated between a Celtic band a blues band and belly dancers.  I enjoyed all three but I admit I liked the blues band the best.  The coffeehouse owner Dennis played harmonica and sang with them.  I had no idea he was so talented.  The bands at the other locations were always tuning or talking whenever I went by.  I think one was supposed to be jazz.  Im not sure about the other.  This was the first Second Saturday Art Walk. and the turnout was great for an unknown event.  There were tons of people wandering.  I was really surprised to see such a broad range of ages.... I expect that the event will grow.  It was a nice way to start a Saturday evening.',3
'Food is great service is great.  Met the owner awhile back and shes real friendly.  My office used to be down the street but unfortunately we moved to Chandler so I dont get to eat here as much as I used to... Ive had almost everything on the menu for breakfast and always satisfied.  Keep up the good work!',5
'03/18/10  Met a couple of Thai coworkers here for lunch.  Ordered side of eggrolls for Mom and friends to enjoy.  She didnt and they didnt even try.  The Viet food connoisseur/home cook liked the food here but didnt care for its hygiene reputation (lacking); She just went w/ the ease of location instead of suggesting a cleaner establishment (she likes Com Tam for pho and Un-Pho-Gettable for rice plates).  Back to the food...  Mom and I split a combination pho.  Itll do.  I also ordered a plate of lemongrass chicken which Mom and I found very tasty.  The home cook wouldnt try it and instead told the other if you like that I can cook some for you.  O-kay.  Atmosphere is stripped-down-to-bare-essentials and theres nothing wrong with that since menu prices reflect this.  What I dont like is having to walk away from dining out smelling like IVE been doing all the cooking in the kitchen.    Please install either  1. a great ventilating system! 2. storm doors to keep bugs out and air circulating in! or  3. crack open some screened windows!  Thank you for listening!',3
'Fell in love with this chain while in Atlanta. This location didnt let me down! Great atmosphere and service was good. Love those steak frites.',4
'Ill be honest I was NOT thrilled when my husband let me know that his friends from work had chosen this place for dinner. For the most part I think stuff like brats and sausage are GROSS (with the exception of a little hide the sausage. lol) and German food to me just sounded weird with the schnitzels and spatzles and kraut etc. but I decided I could at least have the cesar salad.  Im so happy I decided to branch out and try something new.  I had the steak schnitzel (a schnitzel I learned is a lean boneless piece of meet ... steak veal pork or chicken breaded and fried) which was covered in a Gorgonzola sauce...it came with a side of German friend potatoes and green beans with bacon/onions.  All of it was very tasty!  I split mine with my hubby and he shared his Schweitzer schnitzel (pork with a layer of ham and swiss cheese) with me.  His came with wirsing which turned out to be a cabbage and cheese dish that sounded awful but tasted great!  The service was wonderful....there were 16 people in our party and we never felt we had to flag anyone down for service.  The place was HUGE but did not appear so from the street and it was completely packed so they must be doing something right! The only thing Id suggest is that they add a little glossary to the front of the menu for those of us (pretty much our whole table) who didnt know what the various dishes were.  That would free up the servers for more important stuff than explaining all those crazy names of dishes!!!!  I wouldnt hesitate to go back.',4
'Pancheros!!! Theyre franchising now??? I lived on this in Iowa City back in the early 90s when I was in law school. How cool that they (and Jimmy Johns!) are now national from such humble beginnings.  Their freshly pressed hot toasted chewy tortilla is their trademark (plus the mixing of the ingredients with a special spoon but thats a bit gimmicky). Either you love their tortilla or you dont. I love it a lot! But its not your standard tortilla out of the plastic bag so to each his own. Other than that its the usual Chipotle/Qdoba-type fresh ingredients (which are awesome).  I wish you guys would bring back the grilled chorizo option from 20 (!) years ago in Iowa City  and start cutting the carne asada directly from a rotisserie again (also from back in the day). Another way to distinguish yourself from the other burrito places...  Go Hawks!',4

'More of a joke than their bait-and-switch tactics that Dollar pulled on my employee at the time of the rental is their customer service after the fact.

'I have lived here for going on  two years now and my goodness they have done a stellar job. Let me give you The Good The Bad and the down low on Monterra.  ~What To Do~ Its an apartment complex.... :)  ~The Good~ First main positive is the physical location in relation to driving. You are twenty minutes away from each major city in Metro Phoenix. It is right off the 202 literally. This helps me on my daily commute to work only 15 minutes away. My fiance she is even closer at less than a 8 minute drive. The management here is great they always are smiling! Smiling lease agents??? Yes! They are kind and helpful. When we had an AC issue last summer they allowed us to sleep in their promo room near the front. THANK YOU FOR THAT! The maintenance team is always fast with turnaround times and they never quip if we feel like there are still lingering issues. They are non-hesitant about coming back and double checking work done. The rent is also very cheap compared to others in town its striking to me. Overall a really solid complex who havent done us wrong.  ~The Bad~ Not too much. The location we live in although very nice for commuters like myself is situated in a not-so-nice part of the valley. I am not afraid to go out at night but I wouldnt necessarily blame someone if they were. I have never had issues with any neighbors and I have yet to hear any gun shots. This is a pretty low socio-economic area though which is why the price is so much lower. Also they are far away from a nice grocery store. The closest is a Food City which I prefer not to step my feet in. We have to drive a bit to get to the Frys out off of Camelback which is 15 mins away but worth it. The local residents also seems to forget to pick up their dog(s) poo which is nice when you step in it at night. They put out ample dog waste areas and baggies for free so its just laziness on their end. Lazy neighbors sigh... The pool also has a bit too much chlorine it it....OK at this point I am just stretching to find something bad about the place.   ~The Down Low~ I am seriously impressed. They get a solid 4 stars. Its great that they rate out this high but they deserve it. They lose a star for the neighborhood and the distance from a local nice grocery store. But thats really it guys. Its safe very affordable and the staff/maintenance take amazing care of their tenants. Please call them if you are looking for something in the area you will be taken care of!',4
'I stopped in for lunch at the bar a couple of weeks ago.  I had the small harvest salad and the small plate sweet pasilla chile shrimp.  The salad was quite substantial with roasted beets candied pecans and tons of blue cheese. The citrus dressing was light and delicious.  The 3 huge shrimp were perfectly cooked with a lovely cilantro tortilla slaw.  This item is only $6 at happy hour--a steal!  Husband and I had dinner there last night.  The special was a homemade braised leek and ricotta cheese ravioli.  These were outrageously delicious!  Our server was sweet and helpful.  Owner Ken stopped by a couple of times as well.  We are so excited to have a real foodie destination in Chandler.  I will be telling all friends and neighbors to make this a regular night out location.  Oh and the prices are extremely reasonable for super fresh substantial portions and delicious flavors!  No need to drive to Phoenix or Scottsdale for great food anymore!!',5
'Vegetarian burrito AND grilled Vegetarian burritos are both made with animal lard (in the beans).  One employee shrugged her shoulders another said thats the way it is and a third said Id just have to order it without the (lard) beans.  Why make this naive restaurant mistake?  Dont call it a vegetarian burrito if it isnt vegetarian.  Just call it a veggie burrito.   Its especially annoying because vegetarians tend to gravitate towards more gringo places like this one that are more likely to have vegetarian items than the more traditional Mexican places where lard and chicken stock is put in everything.  Grilled veggie burrito had cold cheese inside.  Not melted not lukewarm but cold.  Tortilla wasnt the slightest bit warm either just as if it was served raw.  So theres this cool to the touch tortilla with cold cheese inside and then the grilled veggies.    Tables receive salsa which is nice the hot is really more of a medium but then a small portion of chips.  The one-top next to me had the same chips portion and we had 3 in our party.  Why do this to people?  Youre going to hear a request for more chips within the first few minutes and people are going to wonder why the table only had one little portion in the first place.  Atmosphere is clean with huge mirrors on some of the walls and a flat panel TV on the other showing a nature documentary.  A few fake Macaws hanging from the ceiling.  It still has a trace of the Pick Up Stix feel that used to be here but went out of business.  Ordering procedure is the same.  Staff was entirely unlike most Mexican places - vast majority of people were caucasian or gringo if you prefer and that raises an eyebrow in an ethnic restaurant.  Maybe that matters to the reader here maybe not.  On a positive note the employees did check on tables as folks were dining and were over the top with politeness.   Thats incredibly rare these days.',2
'This really is the only gay bar you could take your mother to (although I dont know why youd want to go drinking with your mom) or any of your straight friends.  Its tame it looks classy and its pretty much the opposite of the seediness and lameness that your straight friends probably expect out of a gay bar.  Just dont go on any day other than friday or saturday or youre probably gonna walk right in the middle of a drag show (too often at this bar in my opinon).  The inside bar is cool if you can get a seat but tends to be too loud if you arent drunk yet.  The back patio is my favorite area when the weather is nice...you can watch the crowd and videos and hang out with larger groups of friends.  The Miami dance club is a little pointless; its too small to actually dance and is a really awkward space that would probably make a better lounge.  The bottom line is that Amsterdam is a great place to start out the evening on a Saturday then head to Burn for some dancing later in the evening (its close enough to walk from here) and let loose.  If its just you and a bunch of straight friends (or conservative gay friends) stay here.',4
'This is a great family owned business! They are always so nice & helpful. The owner always makes conversation & make you feel like a person letting you know your business is appreciated. The lot with goodwill & big lots is super sketchy but dont let that shy you away from this dry cleaner. They also do alternations which makes it nice to take everything to one place. Their prices are good no need to go to a z cleaners or a prestige. In fact the short time I was taking my clothes to Zs in north scottsdale was sooooo expensive it literally would have been more than worth the time and gas to drive down to Arcadia & drop them here.',5
'If I could give them a NO STAR -- I would. They do not deserve ONE star. I went into the service to get a car wash was going to buy the next level up and it was ready for detail. So when the guy told me he could detail the car and get the minor scratches out and do a complete interior detail as well -- for 149 -- I paid it and made an appointment to get back today.   They quoted me 2 hours.  The guy who took my car said I needed to buy another 119 to get rid of the scratching on the hood and right side of the car -- hell-o NO. That is not what I was told/sold two days before!   I went back after almost 4 to see my car just ... sitting them. I was told it was done and had been -- didnt anyone call me -- uh.. no.   It was dirty inside -- headliner was not touched (there were some minor smudges) nor were the visors (My daughters finger prints -- still there! Dirty dirty dirty inside the glovebox and consoles. They told me they only do rugs and upholstery and dash! Hello that is NOT was I was told. The car was clearer with just a regular car wash! They did not even wipe the door frames on the inside!  Then - do they not even TRY to remove the water from the seat? I put THREE towels on the driver side seat -- and it SOAKED THE TOWELS -- all of them and a blanket I put there. Still soaking.   They stacked the SOAKING MATS (water still running from the mats) in the back of the car -- and told me to leave them outside to dry.   Worst of all. My right window was rolled down. It would not roll back up! The entire right door electrical no longer works! NO one told me Hey we could not get the window back up = nothing -- I had to discover it after I went to a store and parked -It may or may not have been them that did it. I dont care. At least TELL the owner :Hey the car window is not working: Right?   The manager was wish-washy -- did not offer to fix anything did not apologize. Nothing. THAT more than anything is why I am leaving this review. I have hundreds of people and places I can go in the valley = If I cant trust you to do a good job. Will not go there again!',1
'I constantly find myself here ordering the spicy Teriyaki chicken bowl. Its amazing. Best Teriyaki Ive had I love how spicy they make it. Good price too.',5
'As others mentioned this FedEx is a 24 hour service location. Staff is helpful and friendly. We had to snail mail a letter and werent sure about the options with FedEx. Staff took time to explain shipping options and prices.',4
'Location is a bit hidden but the salon itself is wonderful! The staff is knowlegdable and friendly and although the location is relatively small there are plenty of beds and bed types to choose from.  There has also been a dramatic improvement in the overall appearance of the salon over the past few months.  Very clean :). I would recommend this location to anyone looking for a new salon for bed/spray tanning.  Also if you have never been to any of the 12 valley locations your first tan is FREE!!',5
'I would like to say that this quaint dental office is the best in Maricopa for this small town there is an excess number of dentists and it can be hard to choose. I have severe anxiety when it comes to dentists and I got lucky I found them to be honest there office is hard to see and not much advertising like those other big names in town. So I want to be sure to put a good review on here so others know too just how amazing Dr. Taylor and all the staff there are! they are nice gentle and accommodating. The office is state of the art with tvs in the room in front of the patient and above on the ceiling to view while you are either staring straight ahead or lying back getting your teeth worked on. They are also the only dental facility in town Accredited by the Better Business Bureau with an A rating take a look at some of the others and you will be surprised some have an F with many complaints!',5
'Whoa! This place is cool! It brings out my inner child. I went in there a few months back with a couple friends and we sat in there and played with the legos. There are shelves and buckets of organized legos and things that I never knew existed such as lego girl hair something that would have really came in handy back when I played with legos on a more regular basis.',4
'2/13/12:  I downgraded my rating from 5 to 3.... It wasnt as good the 2nd time there. Everything is so damn greesy!  Mandarin Buffett at Bethany Home & 15th Avenue is better.  This is really close to our house on 7th Avenue & Osborne right accross the street from Mi Patio... Dinner prices are $9.99 & its all you can eat... Great selection even 8 different kinds of ice cream for dessert icluding green tea ice cream. Cant wait to go back!',3
'This is the place I would go if I were choosing my last meal...it is fabulous!!! I have been going here since I was young b/c my family and I would be downtown all the time because we would be at Suns games...all the pizzas are to die for and I mean that literally...I do not care if I have to wait for 2 hours and I do not care if its raining I am going to wait and enjoy it!!  The owners are so sweet!  I love how they have not changed things or done a lot of expanding!  Everything on the menu is imcredible and if I could I would move in right next door...TRY IT!!!',5
'Awesome place! Called in and told them we would be heading over and we were running late and they held the restaurant open for us until we got there. Truly nice people and great management. I seriously recommend you go. Love their appetizers!',5
'Before using Arizona Exterminating Co. I used the cheap $35 service through Enterprise pest control. All they did was spray for the $35 and nothing more. I dont think one bug died.  A friend recommended Arizona Exterminating and the guy that came out came on time and asked me what the problem was. He went inside and spread a can of stuff in I guess high traffic bug areas of the house. then he went outside and got rid of all spider webs then spreaded a granule thing all over my yard Then he sprayed everywhere. I signed up for a year contract with them and they now come every other month. occasionally I see a bug inside and call the technician and he comes over the following day even if it is a month I am not supposed to have them come. I cant believe the customer service of this company and highly recommend them.   I learned you go cheap on pest control and you dont get rid of anything.',5
'The employees here are really nice and I like the island feel. The food is pretty good and I like it because there arent many other places in town with Hawaiian food. I also like that you can get beer here.',3
'The long awaited much anticipated CenPho brother to Green is HERE!   While this isnt another Green location (dont worry! they will open soon!) Nami serves a huge menu of their delicious tsoynamis and a variety of other baked goods.  This little cafe is all vegan and while my vegetarian diet allows me to overindulge in regular ice cream -  these tsoynamis could convert me. I had a flufflernutter (note: NOT a sexual term but instead a mixture of peanut butter and marshmallow cream) tsoynami that was heavenly and huge. YUM!  I did not try any coffee but am very excited to. They offer soy almond and rice milk - with promises to add more nut varieties soon. Nami offers a beautiful selection of pastries - cupcakes whoopie pies cookies.  The staff here was amazingly friendly and welcoming.  I felt like they genuinely cared about my business as well as any comments or suggestions that we had.      I am glad that I get to be the first review since I was their FIRST customer. This vegan-niche is much needed in Central Phoenix and I am so stoked for what Nami and Green will bring to it!',5
'There was weird pictures of the owner at war (probably about 20-30 pictures) not the most appetizing thing when eating. (Pictures of blown up cars and him holding guns) also the Fattoush salad was very substandard and the dressing was tasteless. And there was an eyelash in our food.   But its an ok place for a cheap meal.',2
'Their rolls are super inventive....and they stay open later than most Sushi Places in the Valley (2am).    Their Happy Hour is insane! Ex: 99 cent beers on Tuesday!  Ive never had a disappointing meal here and I am pretty hard to please when it comes to sushi.  Recommendations: Signature Roll Squid Salad Yellowtail Collarbone Drinks Drinks...drinks.  They have a little karaoke room and full bar you can make use of as well.  1 Thing: When its busy be prepared to order everything at once...or you will be waiting.',4
'After seeing the reviews here on Yelp I decided this was the restaurant the family would try this last Sat (5/31/08).  Sat night church followed by dinner has become our family night.  The ordering system does take a little getting used to.    The kids were a little concerned that there was no hot sauce and even suggested taking out to ensure they had some...the concern was a non-issue since there were some sauces by the soda fountain.  The kids loved the Cuban black beans.  I couldnt get past the look and texture.  Not sure why its not a texture any different than a refried bean guess I just dont like to see it so dark.  Kids had the popular Jade Red Chicken and Carnitas quesadillas.  The hubbie and I stuck w/ bowls.  He had the Chinese BBQ Pork and I had the Chicken Diablo.  Both the hubbie and son didnt think the Diablo was too spicy but I found that it is a cumulative hot that builds as you eat more; my mouth was on fire by the time I finished my meal.  We also got big snickerdoodle cookies with our meals.  Consensus was the food was good and we will probably return.',3
'The space is really cool I love the open loft type look and high ceilings and glass.  On the other hand...  - Parking is all paid parking - parking meter. Teh suck.  - Dont go here if you like people watching - its dead probably because not many people want to pay as much to park as it will cost to buy a coffee.   On the other hand the music has been stuff like The Clash and Depeche Mode.   I so want to like this place - I think its a victim of geography though.',2
'Am I really the first to review? Well I feel honoured. The British honoured.   I recently moved to the Downtown Phoenix area and during my search this is the place that really stuck out. Awesome location new build younger scene and decent neighborhood. It is close to a lot of my favorite places. The Roosevelt Lost Leaf Sens Matts Big Breakfast. The list can go on and on.   I have been living here for about a month now and dont have any complaints. I am in a studio apartment on the 3rd floor of the building. I have an awesome view of downtown straight down 3rd and the Westward Ho to the west. Being a new build I am the first to live in my unit which is very nice. They are a very pet friendly building. Everyone seems to have a dog and they have two doggie clean up stations on the grounds. The pool is nice and open 24 hours. Heated also but I havent had the chance to try it out yet. I have been using the fitness center. It is a little small but they do have free weights machines and 6 cardio machines and a yoga room.   There are spaces on the ground floor for live/work tenants. I believe only 3 or four of these are currently filled and hope some other businesses will move in there. Arizona Center is also directly across the street. I have already walked to dinner and the movies.   If you are moving to downtown please give this place a look. They offer move in specials and discounts on rent when new residents are recommended by current ones. *coughcough*',4
'Three years ago I would drive for 20 minutes to fulfill my fro yo fix and now I can practically find one on every corner. With that intro let me welcome the newest yogurt to enter the block; Menchies   While waiting to go into a meeting today I checked out the latest shops to enter Scottsdale Quarter and noticed this new shop staring at me from my car. Its got prime real estate on the corner and right by H & M which I think is pretty fitting to the brand.   I entered and was immediately greeted by an enthusiastic staffer. I asked for some sample cups and she asked me which flavors I would like to try and got them for me. Although this is a self serve yogurt shop Ive noticed that some run by this regulation where only the staffers can pour the samples. However its a complete hit or miss with each shop I visit. So I tried several flavors and as I made my frocision on flavors took note of the following:  1. Creamy good. Their yogurt tastes like solid cream.  2. They have several fat free options but be sure to pay attention because not all the flavors are fat free...only a couple.  3. They have a decent amount of toppings in dainty little covered containers.  4. They have a loyalty card so be sure to grab one if you plan on making several visits: buy nine and get the 10th free.  5. Randomly enough they sell chap stick at the front for around $1.80. I guess you never know when chap lips will hit!? 6. The prices are relatively decent. I paid around $2.00 for my snack.   And here are a couple final thoughts:  I typically could down a gallon of frozen yogurt if my will power had a day off but today I actually couldnt psychically finish my dinky little cup of it! I didnt even get that much of boysenberry and chocolate mix but the flavors are so heavy and creamy that a couple bites seriously feeds my addiction and fills me up.   Along the lines of heavy frozen yogurt I felt like I was in the frozen yogurt episode of Seinfeld where they claimed the yogurt was fat free until everyone started gaining weight and Ellen took it in to be tested. There is nothing fat free tasting about this frozen yogurt and it tasted like I had just eaten ice cream rather then a healthy frozen snack.   So with that I say goodnight and will see you again Menchies!',4
'I think its about time I wrote a formal review for this establishment considering I have recently bestowed it as My Favorite Restaurant - thats a big title to carry.   I often judge Mexican restaurants based solely on their chips and salsa and Gallo Blanco passes that test.  They have a delicious green tomatillo and smoky chipotle - as well as the typical hot sauce and fresh pico.  Their chunky guac is delish and summery as they put orange slices in it.   Although the chiccharon gets a lot of buzz (I think it taste like Cheez-Its) their best appetizer is the Elote - grilled corn-on-the-cob with cheese on it. It literally melts in your mouth! Oh and it doesnt get stuck in your teeth like most corn-on-the-cobs tend to.   The orange cake is AMAZING and reminds me of my beloved red velvet - except you know orange.   I love everything about this restaurant - salsas food drinks atmosphere prices entertainment (on Wednesday!) - they just need to get rid of that damn giant ugly silver air conditioning thing they have running through the bar.',5
'I took a group of about 15 clients to North in October. The doors were open and the weather was great. The decor was super cool. Although the staff had put my reservation on the wrong day it was a Tuesday at 6 so we were able to get a table. The server was really nice and I have to say the food was DELICIOUS. I think almost everyone at the table really loved the apps entree and dessert. Ill be heading back when I feel like Italian food. :)',5
'Visited this place during happy hour on a Saturday.  Seated in outdoor dining area.  Even though it was cool outside the heaters kept us warm.  Started with the baked goat cheese.  It was very good but had a little too much tomato and not enough of the goat cheese.  I had the pork chile verde.  Not huge portions but it had great flavor and the meat was very tender.  Husband had the french onion burger and it was yummy.  The table next to us ordered the flatbread and it looked delicious.  I might have to try it next time around.  Our waiter was attentive.  I will be back in the future.',4
'Secreto is one of my favorite restaurants in Ahwatukee especially because its hard to find non-chain restaurants around here.  The atmosphere is really cool and the food is amazing.  Im not a big fan of beef or pork so that really limits my options but the Madres Pasta Favorito is amazing!  It has the best sauce Ive ever had and the shrimp and guacamole salsa add the perfect touch.  Make sure you save room for dessert because the flan is to die for.  The only negative thing I would say is that we made a reservation and they forgot about us so we waited for a long time.  I dont really mind though because we were enjoying drinks at the bar.',4
'Try the lunch bagels!  The Northern exposure and Tempe turkey are excellent.  The chicken salad is really good too.  They arent real expensive and the service is pretty good.  They also have outdoor seating.  They are new and as far as I can tell not a chain.  I recommend you try them.  Oh a dozen bagels are half priced after 2pm.',4
'I owe a debt to a friend for recommending Bootleggers to me. The first time I came here was for AZ Restaurant Week. I was absolutely bowled over. When I came in and said I wanted to see the Restaurant Week menu the waitress took the menu out of my hands. I said Wait I wanted to choose something. Then she said No you get EVERYTHING. What?? Can this be?! Everything was delicious but the cuteness of the tasting proportions was deceptive. I was almost stuffed after the first course! The first plate had a mini grilled cheese and turkey sandwich a baked potato soup and a very tender short rib with brussel sprouts and grilled pear. You could tell real thought went into the menu. The second course included a quarter section of a pumpkin waffle with chicken. I had to save that for the take-out box. But I miraculously found room for the smoked pork belly steak. So fat but so good.   The second time I went there was for the Bacon Board. What a great offer. Unfortunately its the reason I cant go back there too often hehe. I truly heart the Bacon Board.   I also love the decor. This is another instance of a restaurant that is too good for its strip-mall location. Its a kind of rustic feel with a lot of wood and metal but they use empty bottles for the light fixture that add a cozy ambiance. This place is conveniently located right by the Shea exit on the 51. I would take visitors here for sure that is if their cholesterol levels arent already on the edge. ;)',4
'wow i am impressed every dish i tried was was wonderful. King buffet 2000 ranks right up there with the best of them.They had a wide selection of trays and a mongolian grill.some of the ones i really enjoyed were a pineapple shrimp dishbacon and potatoes which was more like smoked ham rather then bacon but none the less very yummythey had that baked crab and cheese dish you see at alot of chinese buffets but here the crab meat was not imitation.They had more seafood trays then your average chinese buffet all of wich were good. i had a bowl of soup and six plates of food wich is alot for a skinny guy like myself but the food here keeps you wanting more.So if you go to King Buffet 2000 make sure your hungry.',5
'My first and only visit so far to Sams Cafe was quite nice. The house margarita is a bit pricey but they offer some good happy deals so be sure to get in on those. I had the Black and Blue quesadilla and it was delicious. Our server was bit quirky but friendly and attentive. The atmosphere on the patio is wonderful. With the fountains nearby and plenty of opportunity for people watching you can easily relax and enjoy your visit. I wont say Sams blew my mind but I would definitely visit again. Especially for hour happy.',3
'Am I the only person that CONSTANTLY gets static electric shocks at Costco???  Costco is pretty much the same where ever you go in the valley.  Where are the vegetarian options??  Thats nice you can get a 20 pack of Italian sausages but where is the multi-pack of tofu??',4
'Tried Scrambles after reading good reviews.  Unfortunately food was cold bacon was under cooked biscuits and gravy was just slop and it too was cold. Eggs were OK but it is hard to mess up eggs. Drip coffee had a very off taste like the carafe had not been cleaned in weeks.  Overall the place was clean but it seemed as if they were not ready to be open this morning.  Another thing to note that is not very clear is that it is a walk up service restaurant.   You order then find a table and then they bring out your cold food.',1
'We stopped off for dinner with our kids.  I was immediately impressed that they served Peroni on tap.  We ordered the Arugula and Prosciutto pizza and I have to say that it is one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten!  I had the manager come to our table and told him how in love I was and at the end of our meal he brought us a fabulous cannoli desert.  We took a bottle of their house Pinot Noir that was equally impressive.  Hands down if you are in town you MUST eat here.',5
'The food was amazing however the server was ridiculous... she hit on my boyfriend the entire time we were there and did not acknowledge my existence. I know most girls would have become upset by this but it was so obscene that it was just humorous and rather pathetic on the servers part. She managed to make my boyfriend uncomfortable even going as far as to rub his shoulder.',3
'I stopped in to get my  20 Month old sons haircut.  The only lady barber in the shop had a seat open and I plopped my boy in.  She did an amazing job with his hair and he looked quite slick and ready for school pics at daycare.  I decided to jump in and get my hair cut since i was impressed. Miss Barber did a great job on my whig too.  I couldnt believe it I looked like a sane man that someone might even stop and ask directions from.  I wish I caught her name  but I will take my son back when he and I can no longer stand our hair tickling our ears and necks.',4
'Ive driven by this place so many times and kept meaning to give it a try so I finally stopped in last week.  The only two people in the place were the women who work there and they were chatting away when I entered.   I just wanted to get a quick eyebrow wax but I was told the girl who does the waxing had already left for the day (it was only about 1pm at the time).  I asked if shed be back tomorrow and they said yes so I told them Id be back at the same time the next day.    When I returned the next day the same two women were the only ones in the store and busy doing each others nails.  I asked about getting my eyebrows waxed and they told me the girl who does the waxing was not there.  I reminded them I had been in the day before and was told she would be there.  Finally the woman I had been talking to said she could wax my eyebrows if I gave her a few minutes so her wax kit could heat up.  Why couldnt she have heated up her wax when I was there the day before??    It took about 10 minutes for the wax to heat and she actually did a very good job on my eyebrows.  The cost was reasonable as well - only $10.  I just wish the service had been better the two women acted like I (the customer) was interrupting there gossip time.    I might go back to try the $17 pedicure because lets face it - thats a good deal.  To be continued...',2
'Very nice interior. I Love the bar with oyster shooters and the deli and lobster tank!  Im aware of what fish have the highest mercury which are substituted and which are lying low on the overfished list. I know what water areas are most polluted and which are not.   I WANT to know the country of origin my fish is from and whether it is wild caught sustainable or farmed. When Im paying for something with my own money I make informative decisions and want to know exactly what Im getting.     They serve the EXACT fish that they have on the menu--NO Substitutes. I think that the majority of consumers arent aware that restaurants AND grocery stores can serve fill-ins or substitutes for the actual fish and essentially lie about what they are serving. Yeah thanks to our lazy and corrupt USDA.   Excellent service from our male waiter--the best Ive ever had!',5
'wait for ever for nothing',1
'Sluggos is a great Mesa sports bar with a Chicago theme.  The perfect place to grab a drink with your already wasted Cubby buddies after a spring training game since the field is just blocks away from the bar.    Decent bar food (I like the wings and chicken fingers...see a theme? cluck cluck) and a juke box so you can pick your own tunes.  Friendly staff and a bunch of regulars who will make you feel at home right away.    Kind of tricky to find so mapquest the address before you waste time driving around Mesa.',4
'I was a virgin until today... that is a Zs Greek virgin!    So was Christina P!  We decided to try it for the first time together... and I think we were both pleasantly surprised.  Im actually rounding up from a 3.5 rating since Im in a good mood... but if youre in the mood for Greek I recommend trying this place; especially if you dont care much about atmosphere.    The place itself feels a bit like a fast food restaurant.  Its a fast casual concept where you order at the counter and they bring your food to you.  They also check-in to make sure everything is ok; extremely friendly staff.  We shared a hummus appetizer and I had a large Greek Salad with chicken.  Christina went for a falafel pita.  Their pita is fresh and moist and I ate more than my share of it... the hummus is good too but maybe missing a little something.  My salad was perfectly dressed and came with lots of chicken.  The chicken wasnt the best Ive had but Im extremely picky when it comes to chicken; i ate most of it anyways.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  The reason I am rounding up my rating?  WiFi and drive through... yes they have a working drive through and I can guarantee I will be taking advantage of that sometime soon!  I will be back; nice to have another solid Greek restaurant in my hood!',4
'Best sit down pizza place in AZ. love their sicilian. calzones are great too.',5
'Great food and beer are a great combo!!  Best chicken dish I have ever had is their parm crusted chicken!!   Caesar salad is always fresh and huge portion  Pair it with a Piranha Ale!!  We go atleast once a month!',5
'+ 35 minute wait was 10 minutes + Waitress was really friendly  + Exposed brick! -  A little on the small side...even with the back room its small for a sports bar  (This seems to be an ongoing thing here...cram as many tables as possible into once place leaving no standing room) + There were 4 huge LCD tvs within 10 feet in each direction - They were clearly showing a stretched out non-HD broadcast + Sam Adams on tap - Sam Adams is an import and $4.50 a pint not $3.00 like domestic  (Boston is that much further than St Louis or Milwaukee?) + The place emptied out when the Suns game started + They kept playoff football on the TVs even though there was a Suns game going on simultaneously Weird - The Suns game was on the TVs in the bathroom - The medium burger came out completely disgustingly charred - The bun was HUGE and the burger itself was meager - for $9 you expect at least a 1/3 or 1/2lb juicy burger not a charred Happy Meal sized patty. - I dont understand bacon in Phoenix this is the second time its been so totally overcooked its brittle and hurts to bite into - Rum and cokes turned into Captain and cokes  In summation I would say that its a good place to go for a drink and watch a game but get dinner elsewhere.',4
'The food is phenomenal and the sauces are magic. Words cant describe. Just go and eat.   Ive eaten here more than any other restaurant. This place carries with it more memories then I can count. My bros and I have spent hours upon hours sitting in this restaurant talking about futures relationships and lives. This place is more than a restaurant. Its a place where relationships are built.   Just go and eat.',5
'Well after visiting for an office hours for yelp ..I am ready to give my feelings on Oakville ...not impressed.  The items I would buy there are over priced ( 6 dollar mark up on Queen Creek Products really? )  Maybe if I was a seasoned wine drinker who knew the labels I would like it more  but I think  AJs carries enough of the stuff I adore and only slightly gouges the prices.   The food was okay but unimpressive and no soda on tap...',3
'I ALwAYs shop at Frys! This frys in particular. There are always great weekly deals as well as sales such as the mega sale happening right now. I have the frys food app on my phone so I always look up coupons before shopping. I LOVE the free Friday downloads they have also. I dont know of any other grocery store that does that. I would go back to this store every time I can.There clearance section in the back of the store is also great :)',4
'Best best best !!!! Tina and her husband are excellent. Fast efficient and fair price. Huge selection of nail designs but also simple active length French manicures. My manicures and pedicures last forever. My husband asked if they use airplane paint (joking) because the color is so glossy and lasts so long. I have been going now for almost 2 years and have been very happy every time. Final word kudos to Tina. I have never known her to be anything but absolutely sweet. She is a real pro.',5
'I would pass... The service was horribly slow and well just horrible.  I cant say it was completely the girls fault as the entire bar & restaurant was being manned by her alone.  They are really missing the mark on serving their customers on this one.  Get more people on shift to take care of your customers.  We waited at least 10 min before someone came to our table.  We were told right away that they were out of most of their beers so only had a few to choose from.  After we ordered she came back to our table and told us they were out of pizza dough because all they had was frozen so we had to re-order something else.  Our appetizer came out with our food.  The food wasnt bad but the sweet potato fries were over salted.  That sea salt goes a long way and you dont need that much.  The lighting in this place is WAY too bright for a tavern bar.  And the seating is very strange and awkward.  The place just isnt somewhere I would go to hang out cause its not comfortable. Gave it a shot but it just didnt make the grade.',2
'I like this place for a casual meal.  They have sweet potato fries which is always a plus for me.  The service can be a bit slow at times so may not be the best place to go when youre in a hurry.  Sporting events are always on the big screen TV and there is a live band that plays on the weekends.  I wasnt sure what to expect the first time I went but I have returned a few times so they must be doing something right.  As a girl from New Mexico I highly recommend the Green Chile cheeseburger.  I wish they had gluten free buns but I just order the burger without a bun and its super yummy.',4
'I love this place!  They treat my car if it were their own.  They are family owned and VERY concentious and pay attemtion to detail.  I do not have to babysit them like other car washes.  I was most imoressed by the fact that a manager is out with the detailers when finishing a car and looks over their work.  THEN askes you if all is satisfactory?   Michael M should have taken a proactive approach and brought his concerns to the management so they could be addressed and thus he would ahve been satisfied.  These are the type of people that if he had called them the next day I am very sure they would have comped him another wash at no charge.  But to trash them here is just rediciulious.   Ive been pleased every time Ive gone and now do not feel comfortable taking my car anywhere else.  Ahem  BTW  I have an XTerra too and they do a fabulious job on it.',4
'Always a great experience when we come here breakfast or lunch definetley a new favorite!',5
'Out to lunch with 5 of my co workers seated on the patio and served chips and salsa quickly. The salsa was great although several in my party requested one with a bit less heat go figure. From that point on our service was spotty at best. The appetizer I ordered was forgotten about and was comped by our server ( A Nice Touch ). The entrees arrived and received a mixed review from our group.   A chicken salad that had no dressing ?   A chicken taco salad that also appeared to be missing something  salsa maybe ? The tortilla bowl was limp and soggy.   Whats with the guacamole ? looks like they cut it with sour cream.   Also our drinks went unfilled. The server was very rough around the edges not very knowledgeable and seemed too busy to serve us properly.   Overall. an average experience. My 3 stars is a generous rating for this visit.',3
'Discount Tires will check and fill your tire pressure for free while you wait anytime. Thats a nice service. I found out that they will also repair your flat tire for free. Thats a great service. I had them repair a flat. The tire had a huge drill bit sticking in it. Over the next week the tire lost air so I returned and left the car for them to take a look. They called an hour later to tell me that they had replaced that tire free of charge since they did not repair it right the first time. I hadnt purchased the tire there nor did I have their road hazard coverage. They just gave me a new tire valued at over $150. Thats above-and-beyond customer service. 3232 E. Cactus Rd. PHX',5
'Delicious pizza. Didnt expect such a find while in Arizona.  Cant wait to go again next   Im in the area.',4
'Wow after reading good reviews and looking at the menus on line what a bummer here.  All the interesting looking preps but food was bland dull typical of Valley.  For instance the beet salad with blue cheese.  How do you ruin that?  Boiling the beets into mush balls and putting a rock hard block of cheese next to it.  Some greens no dressing but some sort of gelatinous goo on the side.  Fish with harissa?  There was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate.  I had to put on my bifocals to see it.  Fish was taste-less.  Ditto for hsb duck dish. Not cheap either $140 for dinner with 2 glasses of wine.  How this place is in business for 25 years would amaze me like an alien invasion if i didnt already have experience with this valleys dumbed down food.    Nice to sit outdooors but thanks Ill sit on my balcony and order something from Sals or Marcos or someplace that puts some flavor in.',2
'4.5 stars. Id like to give Tea Infusion 5 stars but I cant. I blame the location for this refreshingly cool place gets lost among the retail stores at Tempe Marketplace. Tea Infusion would be a great off-the-street place to go. I can see it situated in the LGO or Central/Camelback Ave or Biltmore area. Or even tucked neatly off Mill Ave. If it were in any other place but Tempe Marketplace Id become a regular - especially because they have free wifi.  I ate lunch here today with a friend. We both commented on the striking decor - the soothing blue/gray walls and dark wood. There are even a couple of quotes painted on the walls along with vibrant art hanging on display.   Tea Infusion also sells tea cups mugs and tea pots. But is that really why youd stop in? No. Youd stop in to sample the tea check out the menu and wager if youll like this place. At least thats what I did.   I like this place quite a bit for the tea selection is large. From black to white to chai to oolong you have many possibilities to satiate your tea appetite. I ordered a hot pot (two cups worth) of their chocolate mint chai. I also ordered egg cheese and ham on an english muffin (from their breakfast menu which is served all day). The tea arrived shortly with a little orange hour-glass which is used to tell me when the tea is ready (3 minute seep is standard). Once the sand fell down to the bottom I poured the tea into my glass. And I sipped. It was just the thing to offset the chilly afternoon.   My sandwich arrived later. It was just okay. I nibbled on it happily though. My friend ordered the Tuscan chicken sandwich which came with an artichoke sort of tapenade and a small splattering of goat cheese. She said the multi-grain bread was delicious. We both encountered a small problem though: our sandwiches wanted to fall apart. A piece of mine even leapt from the table onto the floor. Messy.   Being one of the few patrons there we were able to relax slowly drink our tea and enjoy a free-flowing conversation. Then it happened. A fresh organic fruit tart appeared and we just had to have it. My friend quickly jumped up to order one for us. In order to make room in the display case the girl behind the counter offered up a sampling of some chocolate truffle-like dessert. I gladly snatched up a sliver for us to try. And then we melted into the pleasures of fresh organic fruit on top of a sweet custard surrounded by a flaky crust. There was also the bliss of the chocolate treat. This would be absolutely perfect with coffee I said. My friend agreed for the chocolate dessert was the perfect amount of cream and cocoa to complement a cup of hot coffee.   I would recommend this place for a brunch or afternoon escape. While the lunch menu does offer up sandwich and salad options I think youd do better sticking with the obvious: the tea.',4
'Great service.  Our dogs were well cared for and we had excellent communication with our nanny.  We will use this service again.',5
'Ive been coming to Little Saigon for almost 20 years. In that time I have experienced several other Vietnamese restaurants in the valley but consider only one the best - Little Saigon.  The place: A family run business located in a quaint converted house that has a great vibe. Lots of warm feeling wood and decorated with traditional Vietnamese art and items. This is the only Vietnamese restaurant I have been to that cares about its appearance as much as the food. The bathrooms are very nice and clean. Other Viet restaurants are usually found in strip malls having all the ambience of going to the DMV.   The staff: Always friendly and attentive especially John and his wife. Johns dad is usually in the kitchen making the fantastic food that has kept me going back for years. If you ever need guidance through the extensive menu or need help on what to order John will hook you up.  The food: Now lets talk about the best part of Little Saigon the food. From the Pho to the Bun and clay pots Little Saigon has it where it counts.  Fresh herbs and vegetables (nothing canned) and tender meats make it a great experience.  My personal favorite are the Bun bowls (Rice noodle salad).  The meats are marinated and gilled having lots of flavor.  Noodles are done to perfection and the lettuce greens and herbs are always fresh.  The Pho (soups) are the perfect thing for a cool day and even in the summer. Flavorful broth with noodles beef slices or meatballs (yes meatballs) and more of those great herbs like mint and cilantro. Yum!  My wife is a fan of the clay pots for the slightly more intense flavors found with these meals. I enjoy them as well.  The beer I prefer to drink with my meals is the Vietnamese 33 Export they serve. Similar to Tsing Tao but seems to have a little more kick ;)  If you are trying Vietnamese food for the fist time I highly recommend Little Saigon.   You wont be disappointed and probably will get hooked like I did years ago.',5
'Love this place its on our dinner rotation. The owners and wait staff always greet us since we are regulars. Great place and cheap too. Try the #100 its the best ever.',5
'I like it! The broth was great. They give good portions of pho noodles and meat. Service was great. I think the lady liked it when she found out that I was vietnamese. =P All in all another great pho place to frequent while im here in Mesa.',4
'You have to love all of the public library systems we have available to us in the Valley.  I am a member of the Phoenix Scottsdale and Chandler Public Libraries.  I have recently started frequenting the Chandler Public Library Sunset Branch as it is very convenient for my work.  I go online put the item(s) I want on hold and they notify me when they are ready.  Picking them up is a breeze (although like all libraries their parking lot gets full) as I just grab the item(s) off the hold shelf go to the self check out and leave.  The Staff is friendly and helpful and this branch has a very nice atmosphere.',5
'Good happy hour specials good service average for a sports bar. We happened in on a Friday on a Battle of the Bands night and enjoyed that. My sons have a band and I made some mental notes to tell them when I got home. It was a young crowd when we went but it may be different on different nights.',3
'This is a great value for the money.  My boyfriend and I go here probably three or four times a month.  They have great low carb choices if you stick with soups or salads (some require a little modification though) but they are very accommodating with that.  If youre not low carbing then you can enjoy their absolutely wonderful bread and the chocolate-covered strawberry that comes with each meal.  I also really like their unsweetened tropical iced tea (but wished they carried Sweet N Low and not just Splenda).  I typically get one of their chicken salads or a piping hot bowl of soup.  I really enjoyed their cauliflower cheddar soup.  It was hearty and delicious.  I also like their BBQ chicken salad.',5
'This place is one of my favorite eateries in town.  Their specialty is the bruchetta board with a choice of 4 thats enough to feed 2 people.  Consistently the food is amazing.  With a glass of my favorite muscato I am a happy girl.  A rounded out meal must include their yum-mazing creme brulee.  The simple dessert is perfectly done each time.  The service is great and the staff seems to work as a great team.  The Monday night Bruchetta and Wine special is really a great deal but that also means it is very very crowded.  I usually aim for lunch hours.',5
'CLOSED. So sad. Loved this place.',4
'My husband and I enjoy visiting and eating at Pho Nhat. The owner/cook often takes time to talk to us and over the 5 years or so that Ive been eating at Pho Nhat we have developed a friendly relationship.  We often jump in for Thai iced tea Vietnamese spring rolls vegeggie Phoand lemon grass chicken.   Very tasty very fast.',4
'My first time!  Your first time is always a little scary but when it makes the hair stand up on your arms (and elsewhere) you are truly hoping you have found a love to be savored.   Thats how I felt about my first time with Rubio. Rubios is a new love (fast food) that is better than just about every other choice within a five mile radius. Some have been ok some have been good . . . and others have been downright unsatisfying!   Rubio is fresh and oh so savory! My first time was quick and very satisfying. Boot scooting boogie good!',4
'Where should we go now?  I think Drift is nearby...have you guys ever been there?  No...where is it?  Let me look it up on my phone....it says its less than a mile away...  ***5 minutes later...***  Um where are we?  This looks pretty residential....are you sure this place exists?  The GPS says to make a left lets just keep walking...  Are those....are those Tiki Torches?  They are!  Thank you technology!   If you didnt know where it was there is no way you would know it existed.    I stopped in with Bonnie G Erica O. and the Poop Guy after SMoCA and I really enjoyed myself.  We had a great little booth in the corner ordered some very strong and interesting drinks that came in fun glasses ate some yummy vegetable spring rolls watched a drunk douchebag hit on the hostess (shes the hostess she cant get away!) and talked about our television habits when we were 11.  The makings of a good night indeed.  The kitsch factor is high which is good because I love me some kitsch.  Dare I say its also surprisingly almost authentic touristy Hawaiian.   Our waitress was friendly and checked on us often and the food came out super quick.  I didnt think that the DJ was that intrusive.  It was good people watching (not as good as other places in Scottsdale) yet surprisingly laid back.    I will say that they really should add Don Q to their Exotic Rums list.  That would have garnered them a 5 star review from me for sure.',4
'We loved the food here and agreed it was the best ethiopian we have tried! $13 for the meat and vege combo plate leaving 2 diners stuffed! The ethiopian spiced iced tea was also very nice and flavorful. Some soccer game was playing on a projector. Love sharing and eating with our hands. The only downside was the lack of service (we had to ask for napkins and hope for refills). Still we would be back in a heartbeat. Great place for parties of up to 20 at one table (if you dont mind waiting).',4
'Organized clean ... and expensive. For me at least. I can find similar things for less. But quality items and good staff!',4
'Great bunch here. I was a moron and made an apt for another locale online they took me in quick anyway. They are friendly and quick!',5
'I took my chihuahua puppy here last Sat. and it was her (and my) first time at a dogs park. We felt so welcome by the people that was there all very friendly. They recommended us to start at one of the enclosures that is reserved for small or timid/shy dogs. Eventually my dog felt more confident about interacting with other dogs so we went to the other side.  In the other enclosure the area is bigger and there are training obstacles. In both areas they have benches and tables. We are definitively coming back!  Excelente lugar para traer perros pequeños y para primerizos o con poca experiencia socializando ya que cuentan con dos areas separadas para perros mas activos y para perros timidos. La gente ha sido muy amable conmigo y mi chihuaha de 4 meses y medio. Importante tener en cuenta que el perrito debe tener mas de 4 meses y todas sus vacunas antes de traerlo al parque!',5
'Great knowledgeable staff taste bud explosion must do when in Phoenix go on weeknight if possible!',4
'I was out shopping with two of my coworkers last week when we all commented that wed been in Phoenix for a week without once having Mexican food!  This was the closest thing we could find to remedy that situation so we plopped ourselves and our bags down at around 6 on a Wednesday.  The place was pretty much empty inside so I was a little confused why our waiter always seemed so busy.  We had to wait quite awhile for our check but the service wasnt so bad as to diminish the enjoyment of our meal.  We ordered chips and salsa to start and I ordered the mushroom enchiladas and my friends ordered a salad and the mac & cheese.  The chips and salsa were good we were pleasantly surprised to find out they were half price (our waiter didnt mention that they had happy hour prices on drinks or appetizers!).  My enchiladas were darn tasty although they were so rich I almost felt like I was eating pasta.  We all left happy and stuffed - Id definitely come back here again.',4
'Great food Great value and one of the best locations on the West side. It actually has some character which is pretty rare in the strip mall/franchise world we live in. The Bar is great Its one of the original building from the early 1900s when the WigWam was built.',4
'If you are headed to the Scottsdale or Carefree area you MUST walk into this small shop and check out the wares.  Its eeeettthnniiccc. Filled with funky hand-made wares that celebrate the crazy Latin culture... we spent a good 10 min in this little store oohing and laughing and calling each other over to look at this...and this...and this.  LOVE the crazy art that takes classic old-school paintings and makes them fun. LOVE the unique metal jewelry peppering the walls. LOVE all the crazy esqueleto kind of Nacho Libre vibe little hanging dolls painted prints photo frames painted handbags...who DOESNT need a thick knitted scarf with a little crazy Mexi gremlin face on it? Come on people think outside of the box.   Came home with a few small gifts for the family. Almost everything in this place is made by local artists so you are supporting AZ talent when you shop here.',4
'Scale of 1-10 (multiple visits): 3 Food 9 **Drinks** 10 Service 7 Atmosphere 7 Value  Im solid on Sidebar but I dont really get excited by the place.  Ive always had great service at Sidebar and the drinks are pretty damn good.  But the fact that they dont serve any decent food makes them just a watering hole - and frankly since theyre a half mile down a pedestrian-UNfriendly road (McDowell) from a light rail station and on the far side of 7th Ave - not a very convenient one b/c I dont drink & drive.',3
'I had the Kobe burger with fries and it was really just okay. There was way too much lettuce on it such that the flavor of lettuce overpowered the beef. Not something you want when youre eating Kobe beef. So I removed some lettuce but was still not wowd. And for $15+ for a burger I hope for better.',3
'Asked for spicy Teryaki chicken and receive a pile of burnt red peppers on top. Whole dish tasted like burnt food. Bummer. Owners seemed nice.',2
'AZO has many strains at great prices.  Professional budtenders who are very knowledgeable!',5
'I have been remiss in not giving a review to a place that my coworkers friends and of course myself spend so much time at.  This review is for the Chandler location only.    The list: - Service - always great!  Greeted promptly always checked on and it seems there are 2 waitstaff per table.  (I did have a friend tell me that one time only...he was left waiting at his table but that as soon as the waiter & manager found out they went out of their way to make up for the oversite.)  - Food - Let them bring the bread!!  Save your non-carb moment for another time!  YUM!  The spinach salad is wonderful and big enought to split especially at lunch. (besides...you have the bread!) Ive had a couple steaks and the prime rib the fish and even dessert.  I swear Ive never had bad food here.  Always meets or exceeds expectations.  - Beverages:  OK selection of wine (see happy hour below).  The do have some high end wineries on the menu but I find they have good standard wines and throw in a few odd balls that you dont normally see on a mid priced menu so try one of those.  They do also have a full bar. - Atmosphere - can be a bit loud.  Especially if people do not remove the screaming children.  :-(   - Happy Hour - definately do the patio.  When its chilly they have heaters and a big fireplace.  The sliders are a complete meal!  They also do (I assume they still do) 1/2 price bottles of wine on Mondays!!    So...dont let the fact that its a chain deter you.  Give them a try.  I think youll be pleased.  Cheers!',4
'Divey pub with a decent atmosphere.  A little too smokey for my taste and the beer selection on tap is nothing to brag about.  The crowd was a combination of skater types and preppy types.  It was interesting but not that exciting.',2
'I have difficulty sleeping in hotels if there is noise coming from vending machines ice machines noisy neighbors parties... So I add a request for a quiet room to my reservation in the comments section.  I guess I forgot to mention street noise on this reservation.  Rooms facing 44th Street get considerable street noise all night.  And o.k. I get it... were trying to go green (everyone applaud).  This hotel does not allow you to control heat vs. air conditioning.  Yes you can set the thermostat WHEN THE SYSTEM IS TURNED ON BUT...  When the outside temps are above 70 they turn on A/C.  When they are below 55 they turn on the heat.  When they are in between everything is shut off.  Cant even get a fan to recirculate the air in the room.  It would be nice to be able to decide for myself whether I need heat or air conditioning or turn on the fan to circulate air and get some white noise to cover the street noise.  I wont be back.  There are plenty of other choices in the area.',2
'Burger was quite nummy.  Fries not so great.  Decent price.  Fast service.  Small dining area.  Great people watching.',3
'First time there and they lost a jacket- an expensive suit jacket.  Initially the girls there did a pretty terrible job following through but once I spoke to the manager and the owner was involved they did a great job staying on top of it and tracking it down.  It came out great.  While I didnt pay for the cleaning and I was offered a credit the pricing is definitely on the upper end of dry cleaning.  It is about double what my normal dry cleaning costs but there are benefits of the organic cleaning I guess.  Anyhow it wasnt a smooth transaction and they made it right.',3
'Overall great!',4
'These guys are great....they have every battery you could possibly want from watch batteries to laptop batteries....and all for great prices. I went in the other day to get a laptop battery after finding one online through my wifes employee discount purchase program for 101.00. However since I dont really like to wait on things....I went to this locale to see how much it would cost because I knew they had it. The battery originally cost 100.00 bucks but when I told the guy behind the counter about the deal I got online....he sold me the brand new battery for 89.00....with a one year warranty to boot. So I left the store with battery in hand....one year warranty...and a big smile on my face. Eat Drink. and be Merry my Friends!!!!',4
'A sober Saturday night when all my friends were out drinking led me to this restaurant. 30 minutes on the train and a 5 minute walk and I was here. Upon walking in I had high hopes.   Khai Hoan has the typical we arent trying to impress anyone Vietnamese restaurant atmosphere. It was filled with a lot of Asian folks speaking their native tongue unlike a lot of places full of whitey.  The woman who owns the place was very cordial and although her english was somewhat broken she was tremendously helpful to me. A walk through the kitchen to wash my hands revealed how clean the place has to be kept. Obviously they wouldnt want anyone walking to the restroom and seeing a dirty kitchen. Hopes still high!  My bowl of bun came #19 ($7.25) with egg rolls and pork my usual bowl at any Vietnamese restaurant. Usually the bowl is oversized giving you room to mix up your ingredients once you put your favorite condiments on it. Unfortunately the bowl was packed to the brim so I had to make some adjustments on how i eat the dish. As for taste the overwhelming flavor of barbecue pork dominated everything in the bowl which was a delicious flavor but somewhat disappointing that I couldnt taste the sauce.  This restaurant is also in a pretty skeezy neighborhood. Id forgotten how long it has been since I have encountered your run of the mill trailer park white crack/meth heads in public. They kind of scare me. Id rather deal with a drunk bum anyday.   +2 for the service  -1 for the overwhelming taste of barbecue -1 for the awful neighborhood',5
'I loved this car wash..once I figured out how to get into it (easiest to enter from 44th street).  No Cheesecake Factory menu that takes 20 minutes to read and figure out what the difference is between the $4 wash the $7 wash the $12 wash...you get the idea.  I took my husbands vehicle in while he was out of town.  I know Im nice like that.  $25 for an SUV complete wash.  This is a true hand wash.  No conveyor belts or automated water squirter things.  Guys with hoses who do a really good job.  They use compressed air to dry and I watched them go over and over the car to make sure nothing was missed.  I was hard-pressed to find any water streaks.  It can be slow but its worth it.  The only downside is the waiting area is outside (covered) so I dont anticipate his vehicles next wash until November.  Luckily my 10 year old vehicle has no aversions to machine washes.  But then again It would be lucky to get washed before November anyway.',4
'Sure we have one by us back in the South Bay that we never go to so we saw the commercial before leaving and I added it to the itinerary as a b onus it is not far from the resort we stayed at. I think we found a new seafood restaurant to add to our list. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. The place is not very clean though. We watched the servers as they cleared the tables around us just drop the stuff they wiped off onto the floor. One table had a puddle under it and they tried to seat some people there but they asked for another table and they never cleaned it up and sat another couple. But enough of the negative (Just check the seats and under the table before accepting table). The food was great I ordered the fishermans platter so it had Popcorn shrimp a generous fish filet Great balls of fire (handmade seafood and crab with jalapenos mixed with cream cheese and coated with breadcrumbs fired up and served with Ranch dressing) and fried calamari (The calamari was a little overdone) but the overall meal was amazing and generous. I think we got our moneys worth though we were too stuffed to order dessert. My wife ordered the Skillet Paella it sure looked great clams mussels shrimp scallops and sausage with a tomato based sauce and served over rice. YUMMY! Well definitely go back and try the ones closer to home.',4
'I have since returned to Rositas after my bad/mediocre experience and it seems to be just fine.  Just fine as in it would be amazing if located in a northern state but here in Arizona where delicious Mexican food is plentiful it doesnt stand out.    I appreciate that they offer two types of beans rather than just the standard refried variety.  The service and food have been fine lately.',3
'Ended up here twice in one week. The first event was happy hour with a large group of women. The sunset was beautiful from the patio. Great HH food menu and couldnt believe the higher end wines at HH prices.  I ordered the hot and buff salad - AMAZING at only $9.00. All 13 women were pleased with the meal they ordered - no small feat! The wait staff worked hard to get everything right and were very pleasant as well. We noticed that as the sun went down the patio got VERY dark - there was really no extra lighting out there.  Also when you are seated close to the open door leading to the inside the blowing fan was so loud it was very annoying. Luckily if you just move away from the door it quiets down quickly (but unfortunately it gets darker). Went back Saturday night with hubby. Went out to patio. Once again very dark. Pretty empty people smoking really no ambiance although it was such a beautiful night. Also competing music with stereo system and live music at neighboring sushi bar. Waitress was VERY friendly!  Food was EXCELLENT! We ordered a pizza that was so good and the side salads were huge. Again - nice wine selection for a pub atmosphere. So - if you want good food and friendly service this is the place. If you are looking for nightlife or ambiance PHG needs to work a little harder. this could be a seriously fun popular venue for all age groups. It is huge great indoor/outdoor spaces and nice location for South Tempe Ahwatukee people. Maybe It just needs some live music more lighting and ambiance outside etc. We would love to see this place succeed.',4
'below average BBQ. Had two meat plate. Pulled pork was dry. Had to wet it down with a lot of BBQ sauce. Sliced Brisket was so dry it crumbled apart. Not even BBQ sauce could save it. Jalapeno Beans are VERY bland and not even a HINT of jalapeno.  Original Potato Salad was just OK. Ive eaten at Dickeys in other states and really enjoyed them.  Here...not so much. Very disappointed.',2
'What more can you say about a menu that is Mexican and Greek?  I love this restaurant everything Ive had (Mexican or Greek) has been superb.  The service is awesome and even though the joint is tiny they move the folks in and out quickly.  If youre ever in the area and hungry for Mexican (or Greek) - dont hesitate to stop here!',5
'I love it!  Great atmosphere excellent food and drink and an awesome waitress Ashley!  This was our first time the place is huge.  Lots of seating with everything from the sitting at the bar to large hightop tables near the bar to regular sit down tables.  We went for lunch on a Saturday and were able to get right in.  Our waitress quickly greeted us and provided a couple of beer samples before we settled on my favorite Sonoran White Chocolate Ale....yum!  The menu was fairly extensive with a wide assortment to choose from.  I decided on the California roll appetizers with a house salad.  The house salad had a lot of extras in it not just lettuce and they have practically every salad dressing you could want.  My meal was very good.  My husband got the Reuben sandwich.  Hes somewhat of a Reuben connoisseur and he professed that it was the BEST Reuben hed ever had.  Im going back in a couple of days for a work HH and think everyone is going to love it was well.',5
'Amazing selection of beer! Good specials too. I was able to find my favourite Maui Brewing Company Mana Wheat here which made my day! The food is very good and portions are more than ample so you can easily split something or just have a lunch for yourself the next day. Service is really friendly and the vibe in here is really relaxed and fun. I came in after a race and didnt feel at all out of place in my racing gear and all sweaty and tired. My new favourite post-race place!',4
'Great place some of the friendliest folks around a wide variety of reasonably-priced choices and some awesome presentations make for a wonderful place to congregate with your vegan / vegetarian friends... that is... if you guys can carpool as their parking lot is tiny. Who needs meat when there are places like this that use color spices flavorings and lots of pizzazz to make their food stand out?',4
'I have a love-hate relationship with this Starbux. For a long time it was my absolute favorite place in the valley. To come and read study have coffee with a friend ... It is spacious nice great atmosphere. Then they started hiring some slow pretentious morons and it all went down the drain. Lines at the register and drive thru were annoying beyond description. At the same time a lot of people started coming there and on weekends it is almost impossible to find an empty chair. On top of everything they crank up AC that you literally freeze if sit longer than 30 minutes.  Well thats the bad. But it is still best place for casual coffee date in the area. It is never dull or boring and atmosphere is always uplifting enough.   Update;  The new stuck up management can suck it. Im not pain in the ... about customer service usually but when newly hired shift supervisor comes to a customer that comes every day (multiple times) for years and says if he leaves tea bag on the floor again (it happened maybe 2-3 times better than on the tables I would say) she wont serve him again then I have problem with that. It happened to a friend I was present and the rudeness and attitude she gave was just disgusting. Im writing a complaing for this one for sure!',3
'I took takeout so my review will be somewhat limited.   First impression ... you come in and the place looks tired. Not bad but kind of like I wish you would go away so I can rest tired.  Wouldnt want to actually eat there but for the 10 minutes it took it was ok. Didnt try Mongolian but it looked ok.  Cant beat the takeout. $6.99 (takeout or reinstated price?) for a 3 section styrofoam box that you can fill to your little hearts content. As long as the lid can close comfortably ... there is a sign to this effect.  The buffet was average. I stuck to the appetizer-type stuff and filled it up. Ultimately it was enough for 2 or 3 meals. Not bad for a set price. However if youre craving quality Chinese this is not it. Not by a long shot. Good for a day when youre not picky about taste (not bad mind you) or content.  Takeout also came with a container for soup. The hot and sour did look awesome with large chunks of tofu and it was one of the better ones I have tried. Upon request the attendant also filled a large bag of crispy noodles for me to take along. They did have little cups for sauces but the hot mustard looked plastic and congealed. Scary to eat scary to taste so I left it there. And there was no plum sauce to mix it with.    I was surprised that they didnt have a regular menu also but all buffet all the time ...   will I go again ? one of lifes questions yet to be answered. And asked ...',2
'Culinary Adventure #2 in Phx went MUCH MUCH better than #1.   This is a place my dad frequents and kept talking about all day so I was eager to give it a shot. As we were driving up I noticed it was in a stripmall-esque area and I was like Daaaad...why always the strip mall places. But as soon as we got in - definitely a different atmosphere than I expected. The front area is a decent bar and a waiting area; the TV in the corner was showing the ASU/UofA Bball game. There were about 4 tables full in there but it was after 8pm on a Wednesday so I didnt hold that against them at all.   Everyone knew my dad and greeted our table with warm smiles. Some quips about the Cards and we ordered; my dad pretty much knew what was good so we went with that.   Bread was awesome - a nuttier bread which I am always a fan of. Get the garlic butter to spread on - mmmm. We got a special meal that my dad concocted that hes evidently had there numerous times - grilled (not breaded) eggplant and a side of penne with peppers/mushrooms in an al diavolo sauce. Very good. The sauce was especially spectacular.   The service was nice - attentive yet not intrusive. Best. After clearing our plates and bringing out dessert they brought over some amaretto on the rocks to wash down our meal. What a nice touch!  I had nothing bad to say about this place except for I dont think people know much about it since its tucked into a stripmall next to (I think) a dry cleaner or some other inane business. Highly recommended and I will definitely be back the next time Im in Phx!',5
'I usually like to give a specific recommendation on what to try at places but thats just impossible because everything is so darn good at Carambas',4
'I have never been here before and wanted to check it out. We walked in and the place was absolutely filthy. Every table that we walked up to was dirty...not just a little...i mean there was trash on the tables ketchup drinks spilled on the floor. It looked like there was a food fight.    There were about 5 employees behind the counter playing around and when I asked if someone could please clean a table I was told that there should be a clean one somewhere.  Ok...see ya !!',1
'I was a huge fan of their Desert Ridge location.  I am so sad to see its not around anymore.  My first time at the Snottsdale location and I was pleased.  I ordered a mango martini and it was fresh and yummy.  My wife and I did the biggest no no you could do at a first time establishment.  I am not talking about sex in the bathroom.  I am talking about ordering the same thing at a family style place.  We both got the Pad Thai it was out of this world.    I looked around at other things people were getting and I was amazed.  The presentation of the dishes and smiles on their faces made me realize its all good here.  Well be going back again sooner than later.',4
'I stumbled upon Romantasy Cabaret online & decided it looked interested. I purchased a set of tickets took my boyfriend and was both entertained & amused. Romantasy Cabaret puts on a truly fantastic show the performers are wonderfully talented. We have been back a few times and plan to go to more upcoming shows. Get tickets early as they go fast and you really do want to get a seat. The show is a few hours long and for our first experience we stood the whole time. The best seats are VIP but the reserved seats arent bad. Either way this is a show well worth seeing time and time again. Each time we go its better than the last.',5
'Amazing food! Strange location with just enough ambiance to feel like its worth the prices. Our server was knowledgable and friendly though she could have been a bit more proactive in making recommendations to some people who were clearly in over their head. I loved everything I had but the pork belly and crispy pigs ears stand out as clear favorites. I wish I was rich so that I could dine here regularly!',5
'Kierland Commons and now Scottsdale Quarter (across Scottsdale Road) is one of those great outdoor Malls. Lots of shopping upscale and eclectic mix. Great restaurants if you want to eat better chains include Cheesecake PF Changs Mortons Tommy Bahamas Restaurant as well as smaller trendy places. The shopping has chain stores such as Anthropologie Banana Republic BCBG Chicos Coach Michael Kors etc. as well as smaller shops. Wonderful way to spend some time (and money) outdoors. Across the street at Scottsdale Quarter you have more great shopping and eats. The Kierland Commons condos located directly behind the mall are high end beautiful modern condos that you can rent or buy. They are quite pricey but what a great area to be in....',5
'Ranch market is one of the best authentic Mexican places in Phoenix. I love there refried beans. I usually get the grilled chicken with rice and beans meal. Very delicious! My fiancee gets the carnitas meal and the meat is cooked perfect. They have many different flavors of horchata and there is always a line for there fresh corn tortillas. Every meal comes with warm corn tortillas and they are really what make the meal. I would recommend just about everything except I think Food City has better pan dulces.',4
'Three stars says A-OK but it aint A-OK so it gets two stars. Food is well pub food. Salty so you can get thirsty for more beer or ale or whatever youre drinking. Go play some games with your friends it works well for that but get ready for louder than decent atmosphere with below average service and a great feeling of vertigo from the obnoxious music pumping in the air and you have pretty much a picture. Great place to start your drinking and driving days seen people do that there...',2
'good but not great.',3
'I love the food at Andreoli but sometimes it seems that if you dont speak Italian that youre actually somewhat of a nuisance to the folks there.  I ducked in today at about 1:30 and it was pretty quiet. There were about 8 or 9 people total in the shop but it looked as if theyd already eaten and were hanging out with Giovanni.  Figured I was going to be able to get in & out quickly. So not the case.  Took a quick look at the board and decided on the porchetta panino and the awesome fried potatoes & leeks.  Ended up standing at the counter by myself without acknowledgement for about 5 minutes (with multiple people on the other side of the counter). Now Im all about food so service typically doesnt affect me too much.  While I was there I counted 5 people behind the counter/in the kitchen and Giovanni out front hanging out with regulars.  I definitely dont expect him to jump or head around to take an order but it seemed a bit excessive to wait that long without being spoken to when there were a good number of folks back there.  Eventually my order was taken & I sat down.  I totally get Andreoli by the way.  I love the food I love the atmosphere. I get the Italian club scene there.  All makes sense.  Ive been going there since they opened and have always been a huge fan of the food. I know that Giovanni is a great chef and has food/product of ridiculous quality. I also get that their preferred clientèle are relocated Italians and that Italian is definitely the preferred language in the shop. I also get that Giovanni is the kind of a guy who is going to do things his way the right way and you can pretty much take it or leave it.  The thing I dont get is that I ended up waiting at least a half hour for my panino & fries without any real explanation or really any acknowledgement at all. The folks just didnt seem to care. There was even one fellow who came in and looked to be a regular who ordered maybe 15 minutes after me and then got his to go food a good 10 minutes before I did.  He was the only one who came in throughout.  One of the guys in the kitchen whod been walking around behind the counter even came out with his plate of bread meatballs & sauce sit down and start to make himself at home while I was still waiting.  Eventually they seemed to remember me & remind the folks in the back.  During this time I took a couple trips by the display case and the other display shelves.  My food when it came was as always stellar. The panino was excellent & the fried potatoes & leeks were amazing.  The thing I dont get is that I would think a restaurant/grocery would still gladly take as much traffic as they could handle. Maybe Andreoli has all the business they want or can handle with ex patriot Italians and they are not really looking for more but I just dont get the complete lack of appreciation welcome that is often exhibited (never this severe before though).    If the folks there exhibited just a bit more welcome to folks that arent their daily crowd I bet Andreoli would absolutely blow up. Maybe thats something they are trying to avoid though?  As far as my rating I give Andreoli 5 stars for the food & a 2 for the service.  Im sure Ill be back as I do love their food but I just wish I could love Andreoli as much as I want to.  Bums me out.',3
'My wife and I have going to this restaurant on Thursday night for past three months to have a beer and a slice.  A couple weeks ago I went there for the usual but there was an NFL game and a World series game on and the restaurant was busy.  I put my name in and waited for my wife and the table.  30 minutes went by and wife had not shown up and the table had just become available.  Hostess said I cant seat you unless your other party shows up first.  I called my wife she cancelled.  Hostess would not seat me as a single...TERRIBLE..Hostess did not tell me this when I first put my name in.  WONT BE GOING TO ANY OF THE ZIPPS EVER AGAIN.',1
'Id been holding off on a review because I love this place so much and I didnt want to let the cat out of the bag and have the demand foil my ability to enjoy weekly wine tastings but I think its time to share the good news.   Cave Creek Wines has a great tasting/wine class on Fridays. They start at 6 p.m. and its $10.   Heres what you need to know:  Its casual. The most popular question is often what is the alcohol content in this? If you get there too late for the sofas or tables you will be seated in white plastic lawn furniture accompanied by TV trays.   They can only seat 45 people. The tasting starts at 6 but people start getting there as early as 4. Depending on what theyre tasting it could be full before 5 certainly 5:30. You can find out what theyre tasting by subscribing to their email blast or reading it here: http://cavecreekwines.com/discussion (You can also read about the other fun stuff they organize here).   Fair warning: Theres no warm fuzzy apology or begging you to come back another time if you get turned away.   You can bring your own snacks and buy a bottle (or glass) to enjoy while you stake your claim to seats for the main event. There are quite a few regulars but they are welcoming and friendly. Dont be afraid to share your snacks with them.   Shortly before 6 Bob (of Bob & Lisa the owners) will make an announcement that the food is ready. You can help yourself to bread olive oil cheese grapes and usually some hot item like brisket ravioli or meatballs. Though sometimes it is a cold item like pasta salad.   Tasting starts promptly at 6. Make sure your cell phone is off and plan to pay attention or youll get teased. Another warning: there will be a joke of some sort.   Usually it is a distributor doing the presentation. Sometimes its the actual winemaker.   Each of the 6 generous pours (probably close to 2 oz. each) is introduced. You will learn something about the grape varietal growing conditions the winemaker the region the process... and by tasting it and hearing the explanation so close together over time you will learn to discern what you like and why you like it! You can and should ask questions! Thats how we all learn!!   Finish your pour before they come around with the next one. Theres no waiting. You snooze you loose. And for Gods sake its not like its a full glass - no dumping! If you dont like it surely someone else near by will finish it -- at least offer! ;)   The wines that are tasted are 10% off that evening.   One last tip on how to find it: its on the northeast corner of Cave Creek and Rose Garden. The first light north of the 101. Its behind the Shell station and the most visible sign simply says WINE in red letters.   Seriously its a great value. Ive been going for about 3 years. For about 2 of them it was my Friday evening ritual. I learned a lot as a result. Im grateful. Im paying it forward...',5
'I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me Good brakes! Whew!   For my lunch I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form.   I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants dont warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes this Blatina can tell the difference. Second the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro.   Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum!   I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good and the food is ok.',3
'My parents took me here when I was visiting them in AZ.  I think they love the fact that the beers are cheap...which is nice.  But I thought the food was fair.  My burger was greasy and over-cooked.  I think the fact that they serve the burgers on paper plates is fine but the place is just DIRTY - I didnt even want to think about the kitchen.  If you go here DONT even go in the bathrooms - they are totally gross!',2
'Im applying to Grad School and I am so excited that most of my classes will meet here. Its right off the light rail and just a few blocks from downtown for those of us urbanites. It really doesnt get more convenient than this.  There are ample coffee and alcohol vendors closeby by for blowing off steam or cramming. Food options not so much but Bowl of Greens is a good healthy alternative.',4
'Dined at CPK on 1/9 with family havent been there in at least 2 years.  Tasted everyones food (!) and it was all very good.  My Jamaican Jerk pizza on a thin crispy crust was the hands-down big winner of the night everyone wished theyd ordered it.  I had asked that the onions be left off but they were not...otherwise the service was excellent (thanks Greg!).  The Thai Crunch salad was awesome (must have it next time) but order the 1/2 size unless you havent eaten in 2 weeks; the gorgonzola & pear pizza is deliciously different; the habanero carnitas pizza was tasty and spicy and the two traditional pizzas ordered by our cant-eat-outside-the-box diners were pretty good too!',4
'The humidor at Ford & Haig is extremely small when compared to the gazillions of tobacconists around the Valley.  Their prices are also a bit high probably due to their location in Old Town Scottsdale.  From what I understand their pricing on rolling tobacco and pipe tobacco is pretty good...... but dont spend all your money on cigars here... there are just too many places that beat them!  The most recent review until mine said their cigar prices must be good too because I see these tourists... walk out with bagsful of cigars.  I REALLY hate to be the one to break it to you all...... but tourists in Scottsdale is NOT the way to measure whether or not people are paying a good price for something!  If youre in the area forgot your stogies and just want to snag one... go for it... the staff is very friendly........ but if youre actually looking for the best price best selection best lounge....... Ford & Haig isnt at the top of ANY of those lists...',3
'An okay cheesesteak  definitely not the Worlds Best as the sign says. I think next time I will try a hoagie. Ive had the Cheesesteaks with gravy (red sauce) which they recommend and it was pretty good. Im really a Cheez Whiz fan and they did offer it the 2nd time I visited but it didnt taste as good as others Ive had. Not sure it was even real Cheez Whiz or just hard to tell cause they didnt put much on. I like it smothered! Not as good as the ones they have at the Suns games.   Overall  they were very friendly so I will go back because its close by. Also nice pics of historical Philadelphia buildings on the walls. I agree with the other reviewer. Probably best cheesesteak at Alma School and Ray would be a more appropriate sign.',3
'Looking for quick moderately priced Mexican in Old Town?  El Molino is your answer...  Its nothing fancy but it hits the spot.  Ive had chips and salsa guac a chicken taco salad and most recently a bean and cheese burro... I hear the breakfast burritos are pretty delicious as well so I may be back soon for some am fuel or to cure a hangover.  Either way El Molino is a step up from fast food but its no frills.  Oh and the people in the Yelp office are huge fans... they are the ones that turned me on to it.  (Gracias amigos!)',3
'Excellent food served well by a personable wait staff. Great ambiance albeit noisy. Shrimp Bisque was Outstanding. Some marvelous craft beers with too limited a Growler offering. We be back.',4

'What great place to come for a quick breakfast!  I must admit when we pulled up I saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that I didnt want to go in cause there looks like a line.  But he convinced me that we should just go in.    We walked in and the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes I surprised how fast they seated us.  There was soo much to choose from on the menu but I am such a simple girl I just wanted to egg bacon and potatoes and thats what I got! And the Decaf wasnt too bad either!  The real reason why I chose to eat here was because I read Gabi Ms review who is the community manager of Scottsdale/PHX area.  The funniest thing is that just as we got our coffee a guy walked by and I noticed that it was Gabis husband then who should be walking behind him GABI!!! Loved that! always great to see you Gabi!!! Thanks for your review!  Great place!',4
'We go here pretty regularly so obviously our opinion is positive.  The service is friendly if not hyper efficient or attendant. The food is consistently good quality w veg dishes generally stronger than meat.',4
'Exceptional service= 5 stars Im pretty picky about what I like and appreciate great service.  The staff here went out of their way to make this experience wonderful. I took my parents out who love Chinese food for their first trip to a PF Changs.  Ive been to a couple in the US and abroad; this ones decor was nice and it wasnt busy at all (around 3 pm). I informed the server it was my parents first trip and she must have told the manager because he came over introduced himself then continued to talk a bit about the store and the food.  The staff was happy which really kept the mood up.  If we needed something we didnt need to ask.  When I looked up to find our server someone would make eye contact smile and inform her.  Oh yeah and the food was great but thats why you go to PF Changs because its delicious. Beef and broccoli Beef al Sichuan and some chicken and shrimp deal with vegetables were had.  The first two were so good if made the chicken/shrimp dish seem lacking.  Healthy but lacking. I wouldnt expect that kind of service from anyone so well done.  Thank you for treating my parents so kindly. Well definitely be back.',5
'Love the look of the place and the staff was very polite and accommodating. The food however was less than desirable. We had the Fajita Pizza and the crust was very greasy and soggy. Would probably go back for beers only.',2
'I especially enjoy the sashimi here... I still think about the salmon.  The atmosphere and service isnt anything special and Im not a fan of the dessert but the main dishes are good enough to keep going back for.  Be aware that youll be paying for the quality of the food.',5
'I highly recommend Skin By Jessica to all.  Jessica is knowledgeable professional and does an awesome job.  They do not come any better then this lady and   I promise you you will not be disappointed!',5
'Go there every month it is the best in the valley for sure. You are not gonna get an awesome service but you are paying a cent for the delicious food be grateful.  strongly recommended.',5
'Fastest lunch ever.  Great vegan options.  Friendly service.  I wish my wife liked Chines because it would definitely be a dinner option.  For now its my quickie lunches at the bar.  Fried rice and crispy tofu!',5

'You know what youre going to get when you go to a Starbucks. This is a clean location with a drive thru window and speedy service. To get to the drive thru you do have to drive around to the back of the building. For the most part I try to avoid Starbucks for local independent coffee shops. In a pinch though you know what they have and can get your caffeine fix.',3
'Good selection of dry goods personal care products and household items in a smaller Japanese market. I just moved here after living in Asia so glad that this market is so close to my apartment. Ill try the sushi next time. But I did check out the sake selection. That was nice too! I do yearn for fresh fruits and veggies there but Im still a fan. Nice smiling guys working there too.',4
'Visiting for a week my wife and I had a date night out to Tonto.  Knowing Binkleys was down the street and being from the Bay area where good food is king we didnt not want to get all caught up in a meal.  Instead going to Tonto the food was good and atmosphere very nice.  I recommend the Corn Chowder soup but the Pork Chops I had were a little overdone.  Otherwise if you are looking for a $100+ dinner for two....I would recommend if in Cave Creek.',4
'This place draws a great crowd. Its totally casual with locals relaxing laughing over good cold beers. Super fun trivia night! Sports playing on many large screens. Its a great time!   The decor is not my bag. And I wasnt a fan of the food. In fact the pretzel was just SO opposite of the menu description it was ironic and I laughed at it. I paid $6 for those frozen pretzels you get at Costco and that generic nacho cheese. The burger was ok. Veggies were fresh and it was cooked correctly but the bun was stale and dry. Ick. Seasoned fries were good.  Now the highlight of our evening was the draft selection. Very impressive. They have Dogfishhead! Yum!  Service was pretty good too. Our food came out really fast and our server answered our questions about the different types of brews got us samples and was very friendly.  Gosh I wish the food was better here. I wouldnt mind coming back for happy hour or just to drink.',3
'I am in Tempe a number of times a year and I love this bar staff are good food is awesome. A little over priced but it is still the best bar in Tempe in my opinion.',4
'Service was mediocre and it wasnt too busy for a Saturday night. We ordered tuna nigiri spicy tuna rolls and the king crab. Crab was good but the spicy tuna rolls were small and nothing special. The tuna nigiria was also pretty standard run of the mill. If Im going to spend that kind of money would rather go elsewhere though like Sakana.',3
'Highly recommend my wife and I went here for a mid week dinner. Food was great Justin chef/owner stopped by table. He explained the menu and sent over a few tasting plates. Service and food especially were great. We left well fed.',5
'South Mountain why you so far!?   South Mountain is probably the largest hiking and biking grounds around the city.  I think the longest hike is about 14 miles long across end to end but then again you have to hike your butt back!    Needless to say as a hiker and trail runner South Mountain offers so many trails I dont think I can get bored.  All the hikes here are moderate and if you take your time youll eventually finish.    One of my favorite is North of the mountain called  the Holbart Trail which eventually leads up to the Dobbins Lookout.  Theres an old rock building there where most people enter to take pictures.  Another one on the North is called Geronimo Trail.  This is pretty scenic and desolate trail but again once you reach the top to Buena Vista Lookout its a nice view.    I havent been to all the trails here in South Mountain but I think its worth a visit since its good for all hikers and trail runners of all levels. - Enjoy!',4
'International shipping is awful! Was charged 77 dollars brokerage on 170 order because they ship with DHL. If you are from Canada or anywhere else international stay away at all costs! Customer service was rude and dismissive.',1

'Losing a longtime pet is an emotionally brutal experience that makes ultimate pit fighting look like a lively game of patty cake.   Without going into emotionally overbearing or even morbid detail I will say that Fairwinds exists to help you take care of the final details for your beloved companion. First and foremost I was very impressed with Marys professionalism kindness and deep sincerity. She explained and ensured that we understood the details of what was happening and what was going to happen.  The process was very well organized and she stayed in contact with us throughout. It is also worth noting that Fairwinds offers a good array of services and resources with respect to giving you the opportunity to say good-bye in your own way.  Obviously its impossible to be completely emotionally detached when youre writing a review of something like this; as such all I can say is that I felt that Mary and Fairwinds helped us take care of our family in a time of need.',5

I have long thin hair and she knew exactly what to do to give it more volume and had some helpful tips on how to style it on my own.  I walked out of the salon feeling and looking like a million bucks ; ).  She is very personable and friendly too.  Highly recommend!',5
'Great food I would come here for the handmade tortillas. The service on the other hand is terrible. On the 4 occasions I have been here I have always had some problem with the service. They do not communicate with each other well. I wanted a veggie salad and the first guy put meat on it than the cashier charged us for the guacamole (which comes with the veggie option) and she charged us for the meat after we told someone 3 different times that it was suppose to be veggie.  It is a cool environment but service needs work',2
'I love this place!  My husband and I found this place and loved it back when we were eating anything we wanted.  After finding out about some food allergies and health issues what we can eat is much more limited - and True Food is one of few restaurants that can accommodate our needs.  Because of my extensive forbidden foods list I order like Meg Ryan in When Harry Met Sally - substitute this for that put this on the side add that - yet the staff never treats me like the pain I know Im being.  Instead they politely take my order and get it right every time.  I would recommend this place to anyone!',5
'This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches  I cant seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers yet they regularly offer footlong subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.  If you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery.',2
'Fillys is exactly what it says it is - a country western bar/eating place with CW music and a dance floor.  My husband loves their hot wings and they are what I would order.  I had ordered the friend chicken once and it came too brown so it was dry.  I had a hamburger and it was OK.  Order the hot wings - drink some beer and watch people dance. Every time I have gone the service has been very good and friendly.',3
'SOPAPILLAS!!! so so good!!!   Enchiladas were good.. chips were spicy and tasty! Loved the patio dining ambiance! Its a little further away from Old Town but worth it!',4
'I must first say that I am from cajun country (born and raised in Vermilion Parish cher). So I rarely try any cajun restaurants outside of south Louisiana. Places like Mimis are as authentic to me as Taco Bell is to our south of the border friends.  But this place is close to hubbys office and I saw something I NEVER see on menus...BOUDIN. This got me excited. If they have boudin theyve got to be legit right? The best thing was their crawfish etouffee. Hands down. They do use cream of mushroom soup in it. Depending on the recipe your momma uses this may be cheating. But it was good.  The shrimp poboy was good. I cant give a place 4 or 5 stars based on a poboy since thats pretty hard to screw up. And you can get poboys at places like Bubba Gump and Lucilles.  The gumbo was okay. But I am biased and rarely like any gumbo as much as my own (even at restaurants back home).  The boudin was terrible. Seriously terrible. Even if youve never had real boudin you wont like this. Maybe it was bad? It had the same flavor as some dressup lipstick I had as a kid. I had to spit it out in my napkin.   I do like that they fly in crawfish. And I like the decor. Its simple...just like many of the hole in the wall places Ive enjoyed in Louisiana.  Id go back for a poboy or etouffee if I was in the area. But wouldnt make a special trip for it.',3
'I know that hundreds of you wait everyday for a new review by me checking yelp several times a day in hopes that Ive been generous enough to share my whit and culinary expertise.   For all of you my fans I have some news that may rock your world.   I went vegan 5 months ago.   Margaret Cho does a stand up skit about people you should not F*** with. On the list are gay men lesbians vegans and Bjork.   Do not f*** with vegans... Do not look vegans in the eye.. If you get in an argument with a vegan say youre sorry and back away slowly. You dont mess with vegans because theyre F******* hungry!  This is true.   I was hungry for 6 weeks until I realized the only two foods that satisfied my hunger are refried beans and hummus.   So.. why two stars for a restaurant that caters to vegans?  The prices.   I am not a cheapskate. I spend a ridiculous amount of money on food. I once spent $500 on a meal for three people - and didnt feel ripped off because it was worth it.  I ordered a vegetarian plate. Humus tabouli falafel & dolmeh served over white & brown rice. Falafel is topped with tahini. Humus & tabouli served with fresh veggies & homemade nan.   So... most places... a meal like this would be 8 dollars. Maybe 14 at a good restaurant. $20 for this... I expect the best on earth and a huge portion.  It wasnt.   The hummus was pure tahini - awful really. The baba was smoky and kind of gross The falafel I didnt think was that great. The dolmeh were good.   The portion size was a normal Styrofoam take away box with one piece of pita.  I will say that the rice was divine. Saffron - y and perfectly cooked.   The price was not equivalent to the quantity or quality.   I was mad. Baiz market sells a whole Styrofoam box full of exponentially better hummus for 5.99.  Vegans are a hard bunch to please I realize but charging this much for less that perfect food will not win my business.',2
'Was treated to this little diner on a trip to Phoenix and was amazed! Great diner food and priced just right.',5
'Been a fan for years ate here yesterday to get my regular hot dog but the bun was a little different.  It was hard on the edge but it still ended up pretty good everywhere else.  This place has been cleaned up pretty well over the years.  I even noticed the health inspections have finally gotten better.  I would be lying if I didnt tell you that this is my favorite hot dog in town and occasionally crave it.  The area is scary so you may want to exercise your second amendment right when you come here.  Also parking blows since there is always more people that want to go here at lunch than spots to park.  It is a very casual place that you order at the counter and seat yourself.  This place used to be a fried chicken fast food place I think about 20 years ago when I was a kid.',4
'I Love Loco the patio is great for people watching the staff is friendly and I always get great service.  The food is FANTASTIC!  The salt & pepper wings are my favorite which is weird for a Mexican restaurant but I swear you have to try them.  The fish and beef Tacos as well as everything else I have had so far is super yummy!  I would HIGHLY recommend this place too everyone!',5
'Never go here! I was denied being sold alcohol because they assumed I had been drinking because I mentioned that I had just left a club where I had gone to line dance.  Please keep in mind it was 10:00PM on a Saturday night they wouldnt even sell me fruit!!!!',1
'I was here for the weekend that Joel L. was the chef. I was greeted at the door by the hostess for the weekend Marianne and seated promptly. I still had to wait for Kirti D. so I ordered my drink and it came right away. She got her drink right away too but it had lipstick on the glass. Ew. There were pre-printed menus on the table of the meal. It was a fixed price meal but there were a couple appetizers you could get while waiting for the rest of the food. I had poutine made with tater tots watermelon gazpacho walleye flank steak and strawberry-rhubard pie. I hadnt had rhubarb in a dozen years and was soooo excited!  All of the food was amazing but the poutine is something I am still thinking about and it was over a week ago! It wasnt easy to find because I didnt realize it was in the Lexington Hotel. For some reason I thought it was a free-standing building. The decor is pretty cool though. The walls and pillars are covered in chalkboards and there is chalk everywhere for you to go draw whatever the heck it is you want to draw. Its a pretty open space which I like. Oh and the booths are huge. Im a booth girl. Why are so many booths red? I wonder. Even though the food was amazing the place loses stars because of the THREE glasses that came out with lipstick on the rims. Three. I know lipstick is hard to wash off but if I am paying $50 for dinner (without drinks) I should get clean glasses. For only a dozen patrons our service for drinks should have been quicker.  I will definitely go back as I am an avid fan of several local chefs. I love the pop-up concept and being able to try new chefs food without leaving the Downtown/CenPho area.',3
'Great to see the new artwork up!  It feels so alive and full of energy!',5
'My Persian sister-from-another-mother took me here for the first time and I am mad at her.  Not because this place is bad - oh no its spectacular.  Im mad at her because of the fact that I crave these kebabs fortnightly.  I think I even dream about them.  Next time I see her Im going to hit her with a skewer of lamb koobideh.  And then eat it.  Persian Room is literally a palace with a fountain in the middle of the dining room and golden plates.  The servers are working at a steady clip (although its been evident on some visits that a slim few are way out of their league in terms of keeping up with the hustle) toting out fluffy mounds of rice and simply grilled meats to tables of customers dressed to the nines and dressed down in denim.  All have a place at this feast whether its date night or late night kebab craving.  We typically get the Shallot Yogurt or Eggplant with Whey as a starter so that we can sop up the deliciousness with the warm bread that is baked right in the dining room.  Of the kebabs Im madly in love with the chicken tenderloin kebab the mahi mahi (which I have learned that in Farsi translates to fish fish - yes I love the fish fish) and the aforementioned lamb koobideh.  You can stick with the fluffy white rice that comes standard but I always sub in the Sabzi Polo (or green rice) that is studded with every herb in the garden for a glorious accompaniment to the kebobs.  If you can make it to tea and dessert more power to you.  These portions are killer and the platters are behemoth.  Although I have to say that in addition to feasting on the majesty while I am there I do look forward to the leftovers later.  Its like the Persian gift that keeps on giving.',4
'We have a couple of favorite dishes from the Taquito Basket mixed both beef and chicken. The bean dip is great with the Taquitos. I switch between Combo Numero Uno which has a taco cheese enchilada and a pork tamale. My other favorite is the Burro de Casa with shredded beef. Both come with refried beans and rice. The burro is served enchilada style. Desert has been so so but my idea of Mexican desert is a Chi-Chis fried ice cream and no one does it the same way. Service is hard to predict often during the lunch hours well get great service however just yesterday we waited 15 minutes just to meet our waitress.',3
'This place has a serious identity crisis. Gay is not a sufficient theme for a nightclub. Everything inside was really haphazard. There was no rhyme or reason to the layout or decor. Four go-go dancers crowded one stage and only one of them received tips. There are two level and an outdoor area yet the dancers grouped in one area. Its not that big of a deal though. They should get rid of the dancers altogether and hire hot dudes to work the bar. Dancers at gay clubs are just...well its been done. A lot. And a lot better. By worse bars. Additionally they let in bridal shower parties and then announced them over the PA. Um Im married to another man but its not legal in this state but a gay bar is going to celebrate some annoying drunk girl and her friends? Sorry but Im from Chicago and bridal parties should be banned from gay clubs until we have full marriage equality. And finally the drinks were extremely weak. I doubt I will ever go back to this place.',2
'YUM!  Seriously?!  Yes this place rocks.  Love the food here.  Great environment -- soooo glad that I have friends who live in the area who took me to this fab place so long ago.  Was just there this past weekend and missed out on another mouthwatering meal was terribly bummed.  Most definitely going again next time Im in town!!!!',4
'Chef James Porter is a great inspiration in the way he is dedicated to using quality local ingredients at Tapino.  To top it off his kitchen masterfully executes the cooking to bring out the best in each ingredient.  Even something as simple as french fries was super addictive with the creative use of Indian spices delicious aioli and most important of all not-your-average potatoes that tasted extra potatoey.   Happy hour is served everyday 5pm-7pm and even though the price of everything else has gone up (as a small food biz owner I know all too well) small plates and wines are still only $5.  I have no idea how he makes any money at these prices.   The portions were perfect for the two of us and we order 4 plates (corndog carpaccio duck confit tacos and clams) plus the fries.  Outdoor seating is beautiful and relaxing.  Service was friendly and professional.  Ive already planned my next meal here - the white truffle dinner on Nov 12th which is only $125 for five courses with wines paired.  Theres no way you can get that low a price for that kind of a menu in LA SF or NY.  Were talking lobster pot pie pork belly sous vide veal and even truffle in the dessert.   Boy do I love living in this city when we have restaurants like Tapino.  By supporting restaurants like this we are also supporting local producers which keeps much needed dollars in this state.  Forgive me if I sound like a politician - must be all the debates...',5
'What is it with this place?  Why do these particular employees of this store have such a weird attitude towards customers?  My husband whos the most mild mannered guy goes into the store to order a salad today .  There were 4 people behind the counter over by the pick up area.  They were talking or milling about who knows.  Waited 10 minutes then you had to finally say hey can I order something?  They said oh sure did you want to buy a paper?  He said I wanted to order some food actually and the girl says oh.  So that was enough to piss him off he said screw it I will go over to Wild Flower right next door.  Apparently they had just screwed up 3 orders and my husband overheard someone asking hey whats with this order whats with this one and each person behind the counter replied I dont know i dont know etc.   So all of that was just not worth it to him.  He didnt want his order screwed up too.  just wanted to get that out there because the experience is almost always the same there oh and I am PISSED because I wanted a fuji apple salad!  I was mad that my husband didnt take the torture and get me my salad so I now put the blame on you Paradise.  Do something about your people or your processes.  Teach your employees to greet people and to treat each person that comes in as if they are going to order something!  Make it so that it is not uncomfortable for us to go into your store and try to interact with your unwilling and uninviting employees.  Teach them some teamwork.  Why do each of them act like oh thats not my job.  That is so weird and even gross behavior.',2
'We had a few minutes to kill before our flight and El Bravo looked to be the best option. I was excited to see they bragged about their tamales and decided to try the tamale burrito with beans and rice. At first bite I was impressed. The tortilla seemed to be homemade and I got a bite of the masa shell. Unfortunately the next bight I got meat. It was the greasiest worse-than-taco-bell type flavor Ive ever had. The beans and rice were nothing special and I had that awful meat flavor in my mouth the entire flight home.',1
'Classic sports bar...great bar food (wings are the bomb!!) service is good for food type...its not a steak house people!!!! Love coming here with friends to have a drink play pool or shuffle board and catch up with sports. Fun happy hour specials...come check it out!',5
'Service is iffy. Sometimes I get a great waitress sometimes a terrible one. The beer is great but the food is overpriced and some dishes are really not good. My friend had to spit out the calamari. I thought the quesadilla was gross (had the taste of processed cheese).   Some dishes are good though. Burgers are good the beer bread is great. Their pork and bean dish is very good (but the beans are bland).  And the parking situation oh lord dont get me started. Prepare to park 1/2 a mile away on the street. Seriously. And turn in your side view mirror or some drunk college student will break it off.',2
'Quick cheap and utterly DELICIOUS.  I regularly visit Fiesta Burrito to curb my desire for (you guessed it) a big ol burrito. You can get a huge plate of tasty Mexican food here for only a few dollars. And your food is usually ready in less than three minutes. Im being serious. This place is gold.  Try their chimichanga plate or the rolled tacos with guacamole and order a pina drink to go along with it. Its great for lunch dinner or midnight snacking.',5
'Good place to hang out and catch a few beers.',4
'Even one star is too much. I consider myself to be a regular to Grassroots since it opened but will never be going back. The OWNER Chris is a hot-head and a jerk. He banned me from ever eating there again because I complained to him about the poor service I received at his other restaurant Wallys. Chris accused me of badmouthing his employees. If that is the way the owner of a restaurant treats his regulars I want nothing to do with it.',1
'Ive been to this Baskin Robbins many times with the same moderately acceptable service every time. The last few times the punks behind the counter were especially loud obnoxious and went out of their way to make us feel uncomfortable. Truly unfortunate for the owner who should know how his/her business is being tended to. After last nights ludicrous display of teenage angst i will never set foot in that place again..',1
'25 degrees Fahrenheit  is a bit cold for me  25 degrees Celsius is the typical San Diego day that I miss so much  but as any Chef knows 25 degrees as it applies to meat  is the difference between a medium rare and well done burger.  A few days ago I had a mediocre burger at Lush Burger in Scottsdale so when my trusty pal Mikey suggested we drop in and have a burger at 25 Degrees in City North I was a bit reluctant. After spending some time at the bar with the menu and cheerful staff I realized my reservations were unfounded.  Getting rite down to it I ordered Bacon wrapped Dates ($8) as an appetizer and we all know my feelings vis a vis anything prepared with bacon and/or butter.  Along came a plate of crispy bacon wrapped around sweet dates stuffed with both bleu and marscapone cheeses.  Without the need of dipping sauces they were delicious I could eat somewhere in the neighborhood of ten thousand of these little bits of  sweet salty creamy tastiness!  So many burger joints get the fries wrong but not 25 Degrees the 50/50 fries were on point!  Skinny as fries should be these hot little burger sidekicks shared a carton with their sweet potato brethren and arrived hot and full of flavor accompanied by garlic parmesan and spicy aiolis (couldnt get the Chef to tell me what was in it though I suspect red bell pepper and cayenne).  The fries arrive before your burger so that you can judge them on their own merits.  25 Degrees raison dêtre is the humble hamburger ordered either by number (as we Americans have been conditioned to do) or in combination with any of three meats thirteen cheeses fifteen extras (including jalapeno bacon and Hatch green chiles) and/or fifteen sauces.  My order was ground sirloin prepared medium topped with stinky Red Hawk triple cream cheese (from Cowgirl creamery) crisp bacon (again my love of this salty culinary necessity is well documented) and Hatch green chiles.  Few things are better in my opinion than a juicy properly cooked burger.  This one had great meaty texture and was quite frankly huge!  One thing stood out the Red hawk cheese is very fragrant but if you can get past the olfactory assault you will find a tangy rich cheese with a creamy texture that ties the other toppings together superbly.  If your in North Phoenix and in the mood for a great burger a cool atmosphere and a tall glass of Sonoran draft root-beer make it a point to stop by have a seat and ask for General manager Courtney Cowan.  Tell her Tony sent you!',4
'My husband said Every restaurant owner should come in here to see what clean means you could have eaten off the floor.  Friendly staff and attentive to gluten free requirements.  The beet salad simple was excellent.  The Cordon Blue schnitzel was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful pork flavor.  Ample serving size allowed both of us to share a meal so that we could also share a dessert.  Both my husband and I would highly recommend this restaurant.',5
'Despite some of the negative reviews I didnt think this joint was all that bad.  I saw Chris Isaak here the other day and the sound was fantastic.  The spotlights were a little weak tho when illuminating certain members when prompted.  I wasnt sure what the think of the revolving stage at first based on the reviews Ive read but I actually didnt mind.  It does give everyone an opportunity for a great view.  Because it moves rather slowly I dont know if its worth it to sit towards the front.  We were about 10 rows back in the first section and we had a great time.    We got there fairly early parking was $5 (thats a steal compared to L.A parking!) and was able to hang out downstairs in their lounge until they let us into the venue.  Nice memorabilia on the wall.  I cant say anything about the drinks because all I had was a bottled water and my uncle had wine.  Bathrooms were clean.  Overall I would go to another event at the Celebrity although it would depend on the band.  I have heard that punk bands have played there and personally I dont think a revolving stage works for a punk show.',4
'We really like shopping at this Costco.  Great product assortment Great location Great prices Great service Great people Great food Great gas prices Great return policy  and their rotisserie chicken is darn good too!',5
'Hadnt been here since college (sadly weeeel over a decade ago).  Still as friendly and delicious as ever.  The one complaint is that the two pinball machines are broken and that I feel old when I come in.  Okay that is two complaints and neither is about the dessert so it shouldnt affect most people.  Sometimes you just want colored sweet snow.  You can mix and match a gazillion flavors complete with sugar free options.  You can top things off with a little cream too for that extra indulgence.  Not as perfect at Hawaiian shave ice where you can get ice cream red beans and ling hing mui powder but for a light dessert after a heavy or super spicy meal its awesome.',4
'I like coming here when I want to pretend to read and then do some grocery shopping.  I say pretend to read becase invariably I start eaves dropping on people seated near me.  Usually these people are either a) real estate professionals on a lunch meeting or b) families with small children who are saying ridiculous things.  Ive also run in to a guy my friend used to date while he is on a date... that was pretty strange.  I like their salads the breakfast sandwhich with feta and the portobello sanwhich (on ciabatta not the recommended bread).  I am in love with the sweet potato sandwhich but it is huge.  I recommend ordering a half or sharing it... even then it is a lot of sandwhich.  A scone will fill you up for the entire morning and afternoon.   My mom requests a trip to the place next to the cool bookstore  whenever she comes to town.  (p.s.  the cool bookstore is Changing Hands... and I agree with my mom -- it is very cool.)',4
'I have waited up to 15 minutes in the drive thru here for an iced coffee...  I gave this place 5 stars  I have been late to work threatening my career with a company Ive spent almost a decade with...  I gave this place 5 stars  I love Dlish the food the drinks everything here is fantastic.  I could eat the California club 3 times a day and only drink their coffee and be happy the rest of my life Ive considered moving to be in walking distance and due to the housing market have almost rented a commercial space to live out of even though it will cost me 3 times as much.  I think Im gonna do it and quit my job.. I love Dlish',5
'My new favorite lunch spot!   -$0.50 Iced/Hot coffee! *** -Fresh Salads/Sandwiches -My favorite: Egg Salad on Wheat or BLT on Chabatta Bread -Apple turnover was flaky and full of big chunks of fruit!  You order at the front and they either give you a number or bring the food to your table.',5
'So I think I have been to most of the Chipotles in the state.  The one thing they all have is consistency.  It is always great to pop in real quick and grab a bite.  At high noon at most locations you can wait a little longer but it still isnt bad.  Their chicken is good with next to no chewy bits.  I have been on a Carnitas kick of late.  Always juicy and never dry.  It is a little more expensive then most fast food joints but the quality is way better.  Love Chipotle!',4
'I have been going to this place for a few weeks now.  Phenomenal middle eastern food.   Its my favorite and I consider myself a connoisseur of middle eastern food.  My favorite was Sabuddys in Tempe.  Its long gone now but its food was of similar quality.  Middle Eastern Bakery and Cafe has the freshest salads and tabouli with just the right proportions ingredients and dressing.  Their meats including beef and chicken kabobs lebanese chicken and lamb are marinated nicely and grilled to perfection.  Their humus and tahini have great texture and flavor.  Their falafel is fantastic.',5
'Birthdays are always a great occasion to celebrate and Phillys is a great place to do it! (haha I said do it)  Last night was a friends birthday so we came down to Phillys (which I am pretty sure is one of her favorite bars and I can see why). This place is pretty cool! Its your typical local sports bar.  Drinks are cheap strong and the vibe is very fun. Long Islands are $4 all day every day. Cant beat that. I smell $20 blackouts on the weekends. Or $20 bad decisions. Whatever you want to call it I call it one hell of a good time....just be responsible.  The beer selection is decent. About 20 taps with some craft beers. Fat Tire Blue Moon and a couple of selections from Four Peaks. Solid.  The food is your typical bar fare with a Philly twist of course. Lots of Philly-type sandwiches with lots of fries. Very tasty. I had the managers special sandwich which was topped with jalapenos. Had a nice little kick.  The outside patio is pretty fun as long as its not too hot. Luckily there are misters. Score.  Id definitely come back. This is the place where you can just chill with your friends. No need to dress up. Wear shorts flip flops.   Guys leave your douchy jeans in Scottsdale. Girls leave your slutty dresses and high wedges at your house. Everyone leave your attitudes elsewhere. This place is for normal people.',4
'I had a two night stay at this location. Check in is at 4pm check out is at 11am. It seems that the hotel is under the process of slowly renovating itself? I dont know. But I guess the lower floors are more modern and new while the upper floors are older.  I came here with a group of classmates we reserved two queen bedrooms with 3 people in each room. We arrived around 2pm and the room I was in was not ready but the other groups room was. We go up to their room on the 16th floor so we could leave our bags in there while we wait and they were given a junior suite. Its nice and spacious and it included a sofa coffee table breakfast table for four the two queen beds fridge & freezer---the works.   After seeing the room THEY got we were super excited to see our room! Once our room was finally ready we headed down to our room on the 12th floor and to our disappointment we found that we just had a regular room. Womp womp. To me it seemed pretty small there wasnt much room for us three girls and our luggage. The room was supplied with Aveda products (shampoo soap etc.) so that was nice.   The only downside for me was that the room DID NOT  COME with a fridge ._. Hello we bought all this alcohol at CVS and we didnt have a fridge to cool it in. Well I was verbally complaining about it to my friends in the hallway (I dont understand I went to a $75 motel in EAST LA and THEY had a fridge for us wtf?!) and one of the bellmen happened to overhear. I felt bad that he had heard us (or me) complaining but it worked to our advantage because he hooked us up with a fridge and stocked it with apple juice and cranberry juice.  I basically liked everything about this hotel except for the fact that the elevator made me nauseous... and also because it didnt come with a fridge! ... and you have to pay for wi-fi!...and they did not have a jacuzzi (but I guess it makes sense that they dont have one since Phoenix is HOT)...  Boo!   -R',3
'Flavor yo.  This place actually uses fresh herbs and spices and food tastes like it.  Most places food is bland.  This place you taste the garlic you tast the pepper.  I honestly think the best thing they do/have is the bread and olive oil wtih herbs and seasonings they bring out.  Serious stuff.  Lasagna is pretty good too.  Here is a tip.  Do not order brushetta.  way overpriced toast usually a little too crispy (burned) and the bread and herbed olive oil is better free and unlimited.',4
'We have been to Spitfire twice in two weeks now.  First time we biked over with the kids on a Sunday for an early dinner and were one of a few tables of people there... but that is where the concerns ended.  The beer selection is by far the best I have seen anywhere in the valley.  The food was awesome... my husband and I split three of the bruschettas (red pepper hummus with artichokes and roasted yellow peppers the goat cheese and apples/figs with molasses and the tomato jam with arugula and balsamic syrup) which were a healthy portion of food as well as delicious.  Now I have nothing bad to say about LaBoccas or Postinos because I love theirs too... but this was just as good people!  I had the beet salad (no bacon on mine... veggie gal here) and it was so yummy that I tried to recreate it at home the next day for lunch.  My husband had the half-chicken and he thought it was good too.  My kids loved their field green salads saying they were the best ever and the kids choices of main courses could have fed an adult (we took home leftovers for sure!).  And our waitress was prompt friendly and seemed knowledgeable enough about the menu... So we decided to bike back over last night for our anniversary.  We repeated our bruschetta choices but my hubby added the duck as well and he really liked that.  I had another salad with gorgonzola pecans apples and a fig dressing) that was delicious.  My hubby had the beef tender (grass fed)... he commented that the flavor was great... a little tougher than he is used to though (I told him that is the difference between grass-fed and corn-fed fatty and unhealthy cows - not that I will eat them anyway!)  Our server was great!  It was a Tuesday night and while there other people there it was not crowded.  We met the owner... he was super nice.  I would encourage all you South Tempe folks to give Spitfire a try... for the food the drinks the atmosphere and to support the local folks rather than all the chains out there...  Keep our awesome local establishments in business please!!!',4
'I love this place.  Produce is a little overpriced with some few exceptions. Salad greens/spinach is $3 but oh so worth it. Really fresh taste and will last in your fridge for 2 weeks because it doesnt have to travel millions of miles to get to you. Bread is good too at $1.99. Dont buy milk or eggs thou. I know what a shame. They are way overpriced. Hickory farms eggs are almost $3 when I can get them for $1.99 at the Mexican store on Price and 5th. I would come here more often if they had the basics right.',4
'My hubby and I are self- proclaimed Foodies. We loved Chef James at Tapino and were thrilled when we found out they were opening this. As many others have stated the atmosphere is charming and cozy. Reservations are recommended especially on weekends. We have had dinner and brunch now and both were excellent! The Vicchysoisse (hard to find in Phoenix the hottest city in the country) is superb as is the Steak Frites. Tradtional french just like Paris. For brunch it was the salmon pappilotte (delicious) and beignets (for our 11 year old) and a different twist on eggs benedict for hubby. Really wonderful and authentic. We are bringing our college son in this weekend for Croque Monsieur. Chef James and lovely host Wendy have hit the nail on the head this time. Laurie and Rodney',5
'The charm and decor of an old time ice cream  parlor with the horrible service of the present day. The silverwear was dirty and my ice cream was used with a dirty scooper while else would cookies and cream have hints of praline flavor? Nevertheless ice cream is ice cream and who doesnt love that?',3
'This play is decent for thai the menu could be a little bit more in depth but the yellow curry was lacking flavor but the Massaman Curry was awesome!',3
'Great food and an extremely warm inviting environment.',4
'I would just like to say that this place is amazing!  I am a pizzaria bianco fan and this place is very close...I want to go back soooooooooo bad!!!  I love good authentic pizza!  I cannot say one bad thing about this place.  I had to get my food to go but it was delicious when I got home!  If you love pizza and I am talking about GOOOOOOOOOODDDDDDD pizza you need to go here!  I love it and I will be returning!',5
'Freeeeeeezing indoors. So I sat outdoors. It was 100+ degrees outside . It was comfortably cool with the parasols and misters and fans.   The only annoyance sitting outside was the huge disgusting fly that kept charging at my food and landing on it. :( Sigh. You need to hire a professional fly swatter if youre gonna sit outdoors. I would want my food too if I were a fly. Its so yummy!  Very fresh pita and hummus. Food comes out warm. Excellent harmony of taste w/ the fresh cut tomato hummus and pita.  I thought the grape in hummus looked tasty so I consumed it whole... only to find out that it was an olive! (it had a huge seed in the middle followed by an extremely olive-y taste)  I got the southwest style chicken on pita seasoned with cheese. It was really good. Chicken was a little bit dry but the seasoning was done well. I liked the taste and texture of tomato beans corn and seasoning that gave this dish its unique flavor.  I ended up having 2 and half meals out of this one dish. (but then again Im a size 00p if that tells you anything)  Would totally go here again.  Its a classy place with friendly service. I would recommend it.',4
'I went back and tried a suggestion that I was told do...  Apparently if you are in a rush and not planning on to stay any longer then 5min the valet guys will allow you to park at the curb. I quickly went in grabbed my ice coffee and left with no hassle. I was with my friend (Manny G.) and he thought the coffee trip to Royal was prettttty cool..idk why but he liked it. +1!  I am pretty sure its not something the valet guys will allow if its happening on a busy day or rush so if you time it right the Royal coffee shop could just pull it off to be a quasi-drive thru cafe ya?  maybe..nevertheless its a sit down coffee place and it will and should stay that way...  R\_  [next] the cappuccino test...how good is good?',5
'What I like most about this place is the girls here speak English and theyre so friendly! They run a clean and efficient business and Im definitely coming back. i had the french done on my toes and i was pleasantly surprised that it didnt chip until the THIRD week. SOoOOooO worth my money!',5
'Have you ever had one of those moments?  You know the ones that melt away all of the tensions and make you realize how lucky you are to live where you do and be with the one you are with doing whatever it is that brought you there.  These are the best moments in life.  Tonight was one of those moments.  It lasted forever.  From the moment we walked in the door immediately greeted by two of the most welcoming smiles to the casual stroll back to the car...holding the hand of that special person that has shared more than half of my life with me.  Service: Prompt friendly attentive and unobtrusive Fare: Perfection to the last detail from preparation to presentation Price: What did it matter?  We both had filet mignon.  Hers with shrimp mine with blue cheese sauce.  They blended nicely with the soft feel but robust taste of the Zin.  They brought us an extra bread hot enough to melt the butter instantly but soft and subtle enough to taste and feel more like an entree than a free appetizer.    Ive been here three times and this is the second time that I felt in the moment.  Our last visit was memorable only in its mediocrity.  Two out of three is pretty good.  I know well try for three out of four.',5
'One star for the most terrible service in recent memory.  Our server DK was outright rude and horrible and outright ignored us when she wasnt making us uncomfortable.   As a former waitress of 14 years I have the utmost respect patience and tolerance for my former bretheren - but this woman needs to go.  BAD DK!  Otherwise our Teppiniyaki (sp?) chef was wonderful the food was delicious and fresh and a solid four stars.  I have been going to Kyoto since 1995 and it remains a fun and festive place with very reasonable prices.  Too bad it was ruined this time by DK!   DK needs a different job more suited to her personallity like euthanizing kittens or something.',1
'I stayed here for a conference in January this year and the initial site visit last February. While I liked the previous decor with the bunny/people statues the new modern stuff is fun too. We had basically the entire hotel booked for our conference and the staff was very accommodating in meeting our needs. Rooms were comfortable enough to sleep 4/room but I didnt get much sleep until after the conference was over.   This conference was the first time I was behind the scenes and I felt some of the prices were outrageous - internet in our conference headquarters was so expensive we only had 3 laptops with internet and it was a fight based on deadlines and needs. A group needed a polycom for a conference call and they wanted to charge us a crazy amount for that as well. For the dining side catering and food was great! Staff serving us during meals was all very nice and it was great working with them. Bar downstairs is great to relax post-conference as well!   Location was convenient for the places we needed to go except for the late night printer ink runs my friends had to make. Great weather in January would love to hike again at Papago or visit Camelback next time.',4
'The Union finally has opened at the Biltmore Fashoin Park. Located by Stingray its a unique area with Royal Coffee in the front area. I do like their coffee. Inside was a small cafe whoopie cakes vendorolive oils and Phoenix well known stores-Frances and Smeeks. I do think the stores need to be a bit more aggressive in sales and educating those walking into the stores so they will buy. They are at the Biltmore people will buy if you give them a reason to..local and uniqueness stand out the most.  I did purchase a few items as gifts this past season b/c they were unique and made in Arizona.  Hopefully this will encourage other malls to have the same type of area for local businesses!',3
'My favorite sandwich place in the valley! I LOVE the veggie turkey sub because it comes with vegetarian deli turkey slices and I dont know of any other place where this is available. A vegetarians dream come true!',5
'I love my AJs. Free cookies for the kids free wine tasting for me.  This is my luxury grocery store. Frys down the street is my bread and butter. Here I get hot fresh soup. My favorite being clam chowder. The salad bar is connected so I will scoop an extra  ingredient to put in my soup Shhhh! Im notorious for a dozen sliced black olives on top.  This is my go to sto for beer. Last night I enjoyed a kick ass pint bottle of Belgian Ale 2010 Cuvee du Chateau 12. Pours deep brown. Aroma is Belgian yeasts. Flavor is candy sugar and spices.  The beer is balanced and the alcohol is well hidden.  Another rarity favorite of mine still available is Dogfish Head Namaste 12. A Belgian-style White made with dried organic orange slices fresh cut lemongrass and a bit of coriander. This beer is a great quencher.  And Dogfish Head Pangaea. 12.  Brewed with ingredients from each and every continent this is slightly spicy ale with a mouthful of rich flavors. Pangaea is a great food beer.  Gouden Carolus 12. Classic pours a dark brown with frothy head that settles. Looks great smells malty and tastes like a great Belgian ale. Silky smooth with a warming sensation.   You can get hot meals like pizza by the slice that destroys most local parlor pizza. And of course sandwiches or dinner entrees. I found mini cupcakes last night they looked pretty good.   I have a favorite checkout person too a high school rival student from the way back machine.',5
'Good food and great service!! Jordyn (yes YN) had a great attitude and could take e jokes in stride.  Even played along with one.  I you go to CPK at Tempe marketplace ask for her!!!',5
'Had a group of 11 at Cask 63 on New Years Eve and were fortunate enough to get a private room. With a big group we got to try a lot of different things... and I loved them all! The mushroom flatbread is a MUST try our whole group loved it!  I had the scallops-- they were ridiculous!  The rest of the group had lamb duck steak and ahi tuna-- everyone loved their meals and we had several of us needing to-go boxes!   I would definitely visit Cask 63 again-- it was fun and so fabulous!!',5
'Still daydreaming about the food. Best ever! A little pricey but worth every penny. Convinced I need to include Cowboy Ciao on my list of monthly must eat at restaurants. Yum yum yum!!!',5
'Ridiculous amounts of bottled beers from all over especially rare for AZ. I cant believe they had some brews that I cant find in SF or Oakland geez. Not to mention a lot cheaper! Must be some CA distributing issue. I havent tried their house beers on tap sorry but with all those bottles how could I. Atmosphere leaves a ton to be desired they could make the space awesome (like beer revolution in Oakland). Honestly I dont get the people who come here but Ill give them credit for drinking good beer. Seriously though why so slutty/messy looking? Did they just come from the river? A little too bro/ho for my style.',4
'The parlor has good pizza and you know what you get is always consistant. Service is friendly and the patio has a nice feel to it. We like the specialty drinks in the bar area',4
'Green is pretty tasty with high marks for the strawberry soy shake. I do agree with the poster below that some items are hit/miss. My Artichoke dip was way WAY too spicy (I could not eat it). My eggless eggrolss were tasty but ..fluffy. They came with a sauce that i enjoyed.  This is one of the essential places for Veg food in the Phoenix area.',4
'I went to this festival this year because I saw the free admission coupon in the newspaper and I have kids so anytime I can get in free with my kids is a plus!  Con:  Parking 4 blocks away in the 100 degree weather.   Pro: Gorgeous church and out of this world moussaka!  I wanted to take cooking class from them right then and there!  My 2 year old daughter liked the moussaka too!  The bouncy houses were nice and fairly priced.  There was lots of room to run around and play.  I loved the food  variety they offered including hot dogs in case the little ones didnt care for Greek food.  The loukamades though were too expensive. The dolmades were unbelievably a bargain.  Three meat filled grape leaves for $2!  They charge $6-7 at a local restaurant for the same 3!  I ate 3 in their cafe and took another 3 home.  Spanakopita was also delicious.  Better than the restaurant!  I am so lucky to live in AZ with so many great festivals.  Not homesick anymore!  Ive lived here in AZ for 9 years now too.',5
'I never made it to Lisa Gs but my visit to The Main Ingredient made me forget that.   Simple Menu some apps salads and sammies.   I ordered Sophies Salad easily made vegan with no cheese and no onion......field greens local tomatoes artichoke hearts fresh mozzarella red onion toasted pine nuts & fresh basil tossed in balsamic vinaigrette.   I dont often get excited about salads but I was pleasantly surprised at the generous portion. It was dressed better than me and LOADED with artichokes tomatoes toasted pine nuts and basil.  There was no skimping on toppings or fishing through the greens for the goods every bite was magic in my mouth.   I will be craving that salad in the near future and theyve got a Veggie sandwich that Id like to try as well. Cant wait to go back!',4
'Of the 3 locations oddly this one seems to be the busiest. Still excellent Pizza. Highly recommend for dining in or taking out.  Great salads too. Love everything about this place. Anyone who says there is no good pizza in Scottsdale has never been to Grimaldis.',4
'Im pretty easy when it comes to my yogurt needs. Give me a cup of the original flavor with some sliced almonds and a bit of dark chocolate chips and Im good to go. I dont need none of that crazy Cheesecake flavor or boba or pound cake mix-ins. Theres just something very satisfying about the tangy original flavor with the crunch of almond and the sweet and bitter dark chocolate. Fricken yum.  Unfortunately yogurtology didnt have any almond slices so I went with mini dark chocolate chips and coconut. Which is not a bad combo if I do say so myself!   Note: youre supposed to ask an associate for any samples which I did not realize at the time because I dont read signs and there wasnt an associate around at the time anyway. Whoops.',4
'Ive been looking for a new reflexology since my last place closed. I thought I would give Golden Feet a try because from the previous reviews it sounded very similar to my old place.  I am socked at how high the previous reviews were. This place was strange and the opposite of relaxing.  To start the rooms dont have full walls or doors therefore they are bright with natural light and you hear everything.  Next  I wanted foot reflexology my feet is the area they spent the least amount of time on - my nose did get a lot of attention.  Additionally the tiny Asian woman who was giving my the massage had the power of 100 large men - I actually have some bruises. At one point she whispered in my ear you like or you want it harder it made me feel like she was asking me if I wanted to be on the client list.  Finally I go to places like this so I can keep my clothes on and be comfortable she threw that away for me when she pulled my shirt up and was rubbing my lower back (ok) then slipped her hands down my pants and rubbed my bare bottom and then played with my hair. WTF? Never again.',1
'Went here by accident because my co-pilot cant use iphone GPS. All I got was beer and wings. It was hapopy hour Beer was $2.75 (YAY) and wings were $5 (double yay). And maybe I came on an ON day but they were dang good Service at the bar was top notch.  I cant vouch for the other food. We all got wings cuz they were cheap and we all loved them. TVs everywhere for sports and OFFTRACK BETTING!!! Big place again with the GAMES FOR KIDS SO PARENTS CAN GET TANKED! DISCLAIMER:Do not drink and drive with kiddies in car. Call a cab. And do not let them gamble while you are busy eating wings. They can learn that later.',4
'So this place is not a great place to take your kids for some ice cream .  I give the Ice cream four stars because its wonderful. The service gets three stars... not so great.  The food gets two stars...stay away from the turkey burger the meats gray and has no taste.  The daily special is your best bet if you are really hungry and cant wait to go someplace better.  The decor is nice and authentic for its time but I dont understand why it has an antique shop attached to it.  There isnt even a door separating the restaurant from a huge amount of vintage clothing.  Vintage cloths and kids with sticky fingers dont mix.  Of course my son wanted to look at all the vintage stuff and when he tried on an old hat (with my permission) an older woman(maybe the owner) yelled at him and told him  the vintage cloths are not for dress up.  I was going to buy the hat for him because I could tell that  he really liked it but if he cant even try it on I dont see the point.  We left the so called Ice Cream shop/Goodwill disappointed and a little angry that we had spent so much over $100 on food and ice cream for the family.  Even though this is an ice cream shop I wouldnt take your kids.',1
'The queen of Phoenix baseball eateries is closed. A sad sad sad day. The stories that were told in the place could fill the Hall Of Fame. In the 50s 60s 70s and 80s it was out the door crowded. It was THE PLACE TO SEE AND BE SEEN.  Alas the economy and competition have done their best to shutter history. So long sweet baby Ill miss your special charms and Scottsdale is a lesser place for your demise.',1
'I think 4 stars is fair. The lettuce on my salad is fresh and the red bell peppers are crunchy. My favorite is the kale salad but tonight I opted for the chopped salad instead. My kids love the potato cream cheese soup. The coffee was lukewarm but the gal at the counter fixed the problem right away. The food and service is always good. We will be back!',4
'The food was excellent the staff was friendly and the place is clean and inviting. Helps they have wifi too! I will most certainly be returning!',5
'The internet is dog slow but the staff is very friendly and helpful and the breakfasts are what you would expect. They even have social hours at night which I havent attended yet but they do serve complimentary food and drinks. The rooms are decent...a bit dated but generally comfortable.',3
'We started coming to Houstons on Scottsdale Road in 2004 our first trip to the Valley of the Sun! Fabulous atmosphere with the Scottsdale buzz of locals and tourists alike. Beautiful room with intimate booths and tables cool jazz playing in the background and the best barbecue baby back ribs of any where I have tried from Arizona to Texas! Try the Thai Steak and Noodle Salad and the Chicago Style Spinach Dip! Service is always excellent and this place is not to be missed!',5
'The service at this store was amazing and the saved my wedding dress shopping experience.  The first store I visited was I do I do and it was horrible.  The service at An Affair to Remember is awesome.  They are very knowledgeable about their dresses and are a full service store that stands behind their product.  As the previous review states they only carry two lines but they are decent lines with good quality dresses for reasonable prices.  If you like Maggie Sottero or Casa Blanca then this is a wonderful store to visit.',5
'If I could give 0 stars I would.  The food is good but at this location the service is HORRIFIC!!!  The last 2 times it has taken over 90 minutes to get a lunch.  That is insane. This last visit it took 25 minutes to get a Coke and Tea.  Servers are rude and probably cost them a lot of service.  I really like the food but I will now have to find a new place.  I gave them a 2nd try but this serve was the same....Pure disappointment!',1
'Great service affordable prices and quality work. I always take my shoes to Broadway Shoe Repair!',5
'Supposedly Delux is the only place that sells lobster bisque in all of the Valley.  After a week of craving lobster bisque a friend of mine told me that Delux sells this soup.  Ive been meaning to go to Delux for awhile.  I hear their burgers are the best in the Valley. I got crap on twitter because my friends knew I was going to Delux but getting the soup instead of a burger.  Cest la vie...last week my cravings were to strong and I had to give in.  Burgers will have to wait.  I went to Delux 2 Go specifically for the soup.  I decided to surprise my boyfriend with lunch and ordered him one too.  Delux sells soups daily.  They make lobster bisque on Wednesdays. A schedule of their soups is on their menu which can be found on their website.  I also ordered the tomato mozzarella salad.  I can never pass up a caprese salad.  While I waited for my order they offered me a water or iced tea.  I thought that was really nice.  The soups hit the spot.  The salad not so much.  The tomatoes and cheese were fresh.  I had problems with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Both came in their own containers.  I tried mixing them without success.  I tried dipping it.  Not luck there either.  It was very diappointing.  All in all I will be back.  Just to try the burger and for a bowl of lobster bisque.  I loved the soup',3
'I got the ahi sliders and they had a lot of inedible sinew in the them...yuck.  The server was very friendly and attentive but surprisingly unconcerned about the poor quality of my fish.  My dining partners had the tempeh and turkey burger and enjoyed their selections.',2
'4 1/2 stars actually...  I really enjoyed Rokerij. Our server David was fantastic and even though we were seated at the bar for dinner the level of attentiveness was super. Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.  Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my vodka surprise on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)  I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak one chicken one shrimp) and loved their dish.  I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!',4
'Who doesnt like a Torta once in awhile? The inside at this location has a giant eating area for families and then some and is decorated with lots of fun colors. There are several TVs that you can stare at while zoning out to your special occasion. Interestingly festive music envelopes the room. I think I even saw a small stage with speakers. Hmmm?  Giant menu with lots of different items and pictures to choose from if you are not in the mood for a Torta. Im hungry already!  Free salsa and chips arrive at the table instantly and are very tasty. I did the Man vs Food last time and it took me over the edge. This time ordered the Nortena de Res which is steak with onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce melted cheese refried beans tomato avocado & chipotle dressing. I always enjoy the fresh radishes and cucumbers served as a garnishment.  Service was quick and friendly. I liked the way the inside was so clean. Even saw someone doing some touch ups on the front window which is always good. Just need a pinata to whack full of candy as you leave for giggles. They are so much fun. Enjoy!',4
'The owner/chef of this place sold her soul to the devil...thats the only possible explanation I can logically think of to wrap my head around how Mexican food can be this good. So...why four stars you ask? Well...this is one of those cases where I have to consider consistency; and weve only been here once...so after a couple more visits more than likely Ill be tacking on that coveted 5th star.   We checked this place out the other night and first thing I have to mention is that it was dead...the whole time we were there nobody else came in...which is scary; as others have mentioned a place like this should be a mad house with the type of food theyre serving up...God forbid someone from Cocoas (which is next to it) actually grew some taste buds and walked over there for some real food.   Anyway Ill get off my high horse...here is what we tried:  -Chips/Salsa - Chips tasted fresh...both salsas they brought out were very flavorful. One of them which I believe was the roasted salsa was basically just a chunky mash up of roasted peppers and onions and was spicy heaven in a cup.  -Carne Asada Tacos - Wow. Seriously...MY GOD. This is probably the best carne asada Ive ever had. Tender flavorful glorious toppings...served on a soft and fluffy flour tortilla...foodgasm.   -Barbacoa Tacos - Melt in your mouth good...just like the carne asada tacos I pretty much didnt know what to say after biting into it it left me speechless.  -Quesadilla w/ Carne Asada - They used three different types of cheeses...that combined with the tasty tortilla and flavorful carne asada made this yet another winner.   God was cruel to me and made me allergic to avocado...so I didnt get to try the guacamole but Katrina thought it was great. Overall we were just very impressed with this place and cant wait to go back. The owner even came over and talked to us for a bit about how the food is made fresh daily and she seemed very proud of the way she cooks it was inspiring...and it helps that she was super friendly and personable. I really really hope this place succeeds like it deserves to.   4.5/5.',4
'They have boba! I have been searching the valley for a bubble tea place and someone told me that Bosa has it. I had the Thai tea with boba and it was delicious. I do miss my boba being in a sealed cup but happy to have found a boba place in the Valley.  Also had the chance to try a donut hole and it was yummy. Ill definitely be going back here to try more of the menu.',4
'Stayed here for a free night and made a few bucks! The room was clean and the casino was not busy at all. I would definitely stay here again if passing thru and need a place to stay.  The food  was pretty good.  There are many slots and about a dozen table games... Lots of parking and valet.',5
'OMG! Stay away from this location the bathroom is a mess! The toliet seat is broken in half  and they were out of toliet paper except for the bunches on the floor.   I sent a email to Carls Jr as well as calling their guest Hotline asking them to fix the problem before someone gets sick. I asked to be contacted by the GM or district management nope I did get a a very nice email from Carls Jr COO Carl LeLecke tell me he was sending me some free food coupons...  I waited two days do post hoping the would fix the prooblem I went back in today and the toliel teat is still  the broken one and most of the toliet paper is off the floor.   You know what they say about bathroom conditions and clealiness of restaurants.  Yikes!!!',1
'Went there the other week on a Sunday and learned it was under new ownership.  My husband and I both loved the new menu and creative drinks.  The tacos were amazing and we will definitely be going back for more.  The green chili mac and cheese appetizer was to die for - I could have licked the dish.  We both had margaritas and my husband especially enjoyed his as he doesnt like them on the sweet side and these were perfect.  Trust me if you want some unique and delicious Mexican food this is the place to go.',5
'This place is either hit or miss. The first time I was here my soba was soo salty that I couldnt finish my noodles and Im a girl that loves her noddles. I came back again and got the curry and it was really pretty decent. I friend ordered the pad thai and I know its not authentic but there was something in the sauce that made me think wow maybe this place isnt as bad as I thought.   I went back earlier this week to get my own pad thai and was disappointed once again. I dont know if its the change in the moon cycle the way the wind blows or which chef is making the food but it totally stumps me how this place can be so on and off. Overall more off times than on so Im going with 2 stars.',2
'People love to hate this venue.   I love to love it. No its not cool like some of the establishments in the Valley (the CB) but it consistently has great acts it bears no pretension and Ive never had a bad time.   I like that the floor is sticky they attract seedy individuals and brutal metal bands will play here.  5 Stars.',5
'Again another find based on reviews and again not disappointed!  Stopped for a late lunch one day and shared an order of dumplings to get started.  Then totally enjoyed the Panang Curry and the Steak Tacos.  Both were perfectly prepared.  Service was great but then we were there at an off time.  Bevgasmd the Ginger Margarita but at $11 enjoyed just one!  The prices are pretty steep which is the reason for one less star.  Lunch for two with a shared appetizer two entrees  one cocktail  a club soda was pushing the mid $60 range!  But....the flavors and execution made it worth the investment!',4
'The biscuits and gravy are one of the best Ive had in Phoenix.  A little bit on the pricey side for breakfast though.',4
'I am a New Yorker and I approve this PIZZA.  Seriously legit - these guys know what theyre doing - prob b/c theyre also from NY.    Plus they have veal parm heros - seriously like the only place in Phoenix that does that.  Good sauce good crust fresh cheese. (Did I mention fresh pasta?)  Seriously this place is the ONLY thing I miss about living in Ahwatukee.  PLEASE PLEASE open a second location in Downtown Phoenix????  Ill even run it for you!',5
'I am giving Juans 3 stars. Only because I have came here for 8 years now. Way before the crowds and the long waits to get a seat (very annoying). When a Bean & cheese burrito was just $1. Time after time I have given in to coming here because of the Green Chile Burritos and Beans. This last visit I had it. I am sorry. I know the family who owns this place work hard. The father mother and children we have seen here constantly trying to keep the place afloat. But please hire a few more people to help you out.. You are gonna lose loyal customers. I couldnt believe almost 20 minutes waiting for a table then another 30 to get cold food :( Very disappointing.',3
'Took 1.5 hours for an oil change asked if it came with a tire rotation and they said yes they said my car was ready and I asked if the tires were rotated and they said yes.  Left and went gas looked down at my tires and noticed they didnt rotate them.  (I had different brand tires on the back then I did in the front).  so had to go back and it took them another 1/2 hour to rotate my tires.    When I went to pay they had some recommended maintenance things I should do all the fluids flushed transmission brake  etc.  and my oil pan gasket had a leak which I knew about.   I said I just got my transmission fluid flushed 3 months ago the guy said oh well since your oil pan gasket is leaking they put that down as a recommendation.  Since they didnt try to upsell me too much Ill give them 2 starts but these oil changing shops really need to get their business together.  Then they run out and greet everyone that pulls up in a big truck.  car people...',2
'Not being a drinker this is not a store I would ever really think about checking out. But there are times one needs wine and some hard liquor for company. This place has it seems everything and at reasonable prices Not knowing much I asked several question of an employee so I would be getting things our Friends would actually drink and they answered everything with enthusiasm.',5
'One of my favorite places to eat sushi and drink Saki. This location is amazing. Located in the heart of west gate plaza. The architectural style/ theme they have going to very entertaining to the eye. Every time I walk to the restrooms sober I feel drunk. haha. Great happy hour times and prices. Love this place. Try the Philly Roll its my all time favorite.',5
'I have to say I didnt really expect great things from a suburban Scottsdale pizza joint - but the Yelp reviews were high and I was starving so...  I have to give it up for Pomo - its really honest to God authentic. I was in Rome in February and this pizza was very close to what I ate there. Perfect chewy crispy crust. Perfect crushed tomatoes. It even has the slightly soggy center the Roman pizzas had.   They take great pride in their ingredients and preparation -  they have the official VPN certification displayed and all of the ingredients are proudly called out as to type and origin. I had a Margherita with Salsiccia - delicious!  It is pricey though - a pizza + iced tea set me back $20.',5
'Wow what can you say about this place that has not been said. It is awesome in every area. There is so much going on here that I will just review for today the Restaurant of Tanzy itself. The beautiful setting is amazing. Plus free parking in the covered Garages. The staff is lovely and all the Managers really care about this place and your dining experience.  Which makes all the difference. We had a lovely table and the wine here is so nice spectacular actually. The food is really good  The Braised Beef Short Rib is simply the best to me. I am not really a huge fan of Red meat either but this is awesome.  The Gnocchi they serve with it is unreal.  Even though I know I am packing on the pounds I cannot stop eating it. Next time I think I will try the Muscovy Duck Breast and candied Fig.  It too looked wonderful.  The Risotto is very good as well  and my boyfriend had the Mediterranean Chicken Penne. There is something here for everyones taste. Plus the chef will totally make something in your direction if you are a vegetarian.  A flour less Chocolate cake is my absolute to die for.  Second time I have had it and I love it.  I could come in again just for that.  The restrooms are beautiful and clean. High end price but good for a fancy night out.  Dress up because you just feel better when you do. HAPPY NEW YEAR!',5
'Perfect experience. I made an online reservation the day before I needed a 4:30 a.m. pick-up for SkyHarbor. They called to confirm shortly after (offered coffee and doughnuts which I passed on) and called exactly a half hour before the pick up as a reminder. The cab (minivan) was super clean and the driver very courteous. Overall a great experience.',5
'If you go to LGO Grocery on a Sunday morning for breakfast or brunch and you see the parking lot is full and there is a line out the door please dont turn around and go some where else please! You will not be disappointed with the wait! Or just pass it by so there is one less person in front of ME!!!   The quality of food is untouchable! Okay really their homemade english muffins are what is untouchable! Try the commuter sandwich yes it is on one of their AMAZING homemade english muffins. If you have been to LGO next door for a meal then you know the quality of the food is top notch well there is nothing disappointing about their Grocery!  Oh and please dont forget to pick up a Tammy Coe Red Velvet Cupcake they are the best I have had to date! The cupcakes can be found in the glass case below the menus. And they are full of the most divine treats you will come across.  LGO Grocery you are truly amazing and addictive. I find myself making excuses to pass by just so I can stop in for some tasty treats.',5
'Mamma Mias is good if you are poor hungry and dont care if you fall asleep after lunch which I dont because my job is meaningless.   All Ive ever eaten here is the pizza and its not bad depending on the time.  If theyre busier they tend to under cook it because maybe they assume a customer waiting eight minutes instead of five is going to send you into a fucking Hulk frenzy and youll chew off someones face and then give them ONE star on Yelp.  And fuckin A theyd be right.  I didnt wait eight minutes though I waited five and my shit was undercooked.  Typically people like their pepperoni crispy take not Mamma Mia.   The other reason why sometimes I avoid this place is because its so tiny and closed in that when you order your pizza to-go and the seats are full you end up standing awkwardly in the middle of the room mindlessly fucking with the fountain machine and gazing at the nonsensical wall memorabilia until someone says EXCUSE ME?!  By that time though youll have your under cooked lunch and it will hit the spot if youre in the mood for greasy New York style pizza.  Then I fall asleep at my desk or think of adopting an eating disorder and vomiting in my works public restroom.  But instead I just eat another slice and look up crazy cat on Youtube.  Either way the lunch special is like 3.50 so its always totally worth it.',3
'ive been searching for the Reebok Easytone shoes for about 2 weeks now. everyone and their mother is completely out of stock. i even got desperate and attempted department stores like Dillards and Macys. no love. and before you start no i dont think my butt is going to look as amazing as that chicks in the commercial. no i dont think this crap will work in a week and i can wear bad ass mini skirts. no i dont feel that now i can eat ho hos but as long as i walk my ass wont be fat! i get it. its a small thing i can do to supplement my current regimen. suck it fantasy. im a realist.  so i spend about 1.5 hours roaming through Chandler mall with no success. as a last ditch effort i vaguely remembered a Dicks in the Fiesta Mall. i walked in fully expected sheer disappointment but to my surprise they actually had 3 sizes left! and one of them was just my size!  staff was super friendly and very helpful with explaining the shoe. i was in and out of the place within 30 minutes fully satisfied with my purchase and ready to get my booty burn on. thanks dicks! i still feel really weird that dicks used to be chicks though. just sayin.',5
'Its slipped.   My husband and I have been going here for years it started out as a special occasion restaurant. Then we just started enjoying it randomly throughout the month. After awhile we noticed the quality slipping. Frozen potatoes would show up in the vegetables and the meat was overpoweringly marinated. Some of the nicer items began disappearing from the platters.  Then we dropped our visits back to special occasions namely New Years. Weve been for three years in a row and have noticed a steady decline. Prices are rising quality is falling and we were surprised to find out that booths would cost us an extra $35 per person (we passed a few empty ones that remained that way for the rest of the evening).   They werent even able to give us our traditional photo (which is part of the New Years package) and they had switched to cheap paper frames.  Honestly they have gone down hill. If you are used to decent quality food for your money there are better places. I suggest Firebirds (much cheaper) or Mastros City Hall (delicious but expensive) if you like steak.   The New Years package includes $25 off a meal one per table coupons and honestly we are so disappointed with them we wont even give them away to friends and family.   Our server was wonderful by the way and our disappointment in no way reflects on him.   For the money you are paying they should hold themselves to a higher standard.',2
'You think they would have some decent competition and more higher end health clubs to choose from around the phoenix biltmore arcadia area but apparently not so everyone in phoenix seems to go here if you want a step up. I disprove of the layout a bit.  The women rushed me to join because she said the discount to join may or may not be available the following week after my trial membership great sales tactic but this ticked me off because I hated being rushed to decide because the price might go up.      For everyone complaining about the $600 or more fee to join this is really not allot of money compared to other better health clubs and it is in place mostly to just keep the riffraff out.  I wish it was higher so there would not be swarms of people every hour of the day...(kind of joking)     They designed this place to be able to cram a obscene amount of people in it from the huge locker rooms ( a bit confusing layout ) to the many many machines.  So a good thing is you shouldnt have a problem finding a machine The focus does not seem to be as much on quality as I would like for the money.   Some of the machines/ equipment are in need of an upgrade. Who wants to join 24 hour fitness ballys or any of the greasy chain gyms not I so this may be your best option.',3
'Went there on sunday at 2pm they were closed. Hours are 12pm-9pm on sundays. Waste of time',1
'Anyone that has spent any amount of time in Chicago or its surrounding suburbs knows about Portillos.  These folks will not look to Yelp for a recommendation.  The Portillos beef is legendary.    For those not accustomed to Portillos this is the place to go for a true Italian beef.  Ive had a few out here.  With the exception of Dazzos Dog House I have not been impressed.  Portillos delivers the goods.  You can also get Chicago dogs Italian sausage burgers chicken sandwiches catering shakes malts and killer fries.    The restaurant is large and will accommodate a lot of people even with the hoards flocking to a new restaurant.   For my money you cannot beat the beef sandwich dipped with mozzarella.  Its my standard order.',5
'I ONLY GET SUSHI HERE!  Never tried anything else.  My expierence have been okay. Sometimes Ill get a good waiter/waitress  So its kinda a hit or miss on good quality service. The sushi that is made here is delicious. I recommend going during happy hour. Not worth the prices other than that.',3
'Van Gogh show was great!!',5
'Great place to eat seafood now im from Alexandria Egypt on the meditteranean born and raised so sea food is in my blood i was very impressed with this place the rockefeller oysters were great and the atmosphere is very cool.  The place is a bit loud and busy but that just adds to the experience!',5
'We went there last night and were quite impressed especially given the other reviews on items we ordered. I ordered a flatbread and caprese. The caprese had large tomato slices excellent mozzarella that matched their size sliced cherry tomatoes and a delicious balsamic reduction. For presentation size quality of ingredients and price it ran a close second to Cibos for best in town. The Meat flatbread was very impressive. Absolutely no excess grease especially considering it had pepperoni sausage and prosciutto (sprinkled very evenly I might add). All ingredients were of superior quality including cheese which lay underneath the meats and in logical proportions. The overall effect was one of the best richest examples in recent memory. My friend had a cheeseburger which was cooked correctly per request and sweet potato fries which were the best we have ever had.  Beer selection was eclectic to say the least with lots of variety. Wine list was also interesting. Service was highly attentive very personable and accommodating. Asked us at least 3 times how things tasted and how we were doing. High marks. Ambiance was fantastic. The surroundings were reminiscent of Postinos and Pizzeria Bianco with a bit more humor. Several TVs and surprising (almost eccentric) music collection piped through a quality sound system.  Definitely worth a second visit!',5
'I tried to think of an interesting intellectual and unique word to describe Nobuo but all I could think of was meh. The food was unique but not special. It was eerily similar to blue hound in that it was a funky weird. The tater tots I must say were very Meh two stars. The Japanese fries Meh two stars. The ox tail house special was extra Meh bland tuff sadly weird. The eggplant was good i think because there was bacon in the sauce 3 and 1/2 stars. The grapefruit and himachi was the best dish: mind you Im not fond of avocado grapefruit or Himachi but this dish worked well 4 and 1/2 stars. A young lady was our server and she was really meh. At a restaurant that serves unique dishes the server should be extra helpful and knowledgeable and she was neither. It seemed as though she didnt want to be there.  The restaurant was basically empty on a Friday night at 730 not a good sign. Do I regret going no. Will I return no.',3
'If your from NY stay away from this joint. I was mislead by my dining companion on my first visit to believe the thin crust pizza resembled a real NY version of pizza. When the pizza arrived though it was basically a cracker crust with cheese on top that slid off when you bit into the odd sliced square pieces. It wasnt appetizing and especially if your pizza pallette is east coast you will be really disappointed especially after hearing the hype from my date. Oh she is from New Mexico so I should have know better. I barely ate a slice because the crust is seriously the width of a dime. We started with the deep fried ravioli which was well cooked but jalapeno cheese probably doesnt belong inside if you like them the traditional way. Seems like Oregenos tries to hard to be fancy with cute names but this is more of a concept joiint than a good food joint unlless you grew up in Chicago. OregoeNO.',2
'Wish I was able to give  1/2 of a Star!   I dont know why the Yelper in me failed to check  out Golden Coin prior to giving it a shot.  However I craved an all you can eat Chinese Buffet and went to Golden Coin because it was close to work. Probably the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to I take that back  No Probably about it Golden Coin is the worst Chinese Buffet I have ever been to!                                       Eight Items on the Buffet   Fried Wontons Rice Lo Mien Vegetables Chicken Chicken Wings Egg Rolls & Sweet and Sour pork   As I took my first bite of rice a single thought ran through my head: How can a Chinese Restaurant not cook rice right?  If the rice wasnt bad enough the Lo Mien sure was not sure how to describe that taste but its not Lo Mien so I will stick with tasteless soggy noddles. The eggrolls were equally bad small cut in half and horrible and once again a taste that is hard to describe so lets go with tasteless again after all it worked when describing the Lo Mien. Moving on to the sweet and sour pork this dish consisted of  smalldried out  hard pieces of what  I am assuming was pork covered in a reddish sauce that had the consistency of water.  Tasteless doesnt begin to describe that dish! The Wontons can best be described as greasy crispy noddles and dont even get me started on the chicken and wings. How in the world does Golden Coin prepare that stuff? Its awful.   So there yo have it thats it. The entire Golden Coin Buffet. Dont think you can wash down a bad meal with soda....no refills on the sodas at Golden Coin!!!!',1
'Wasnt hard to find at all my boyfriend found it quickly. Love the whole atmosphere.  The lighting and all that was romantic.  Super cute.    I got the vegetarian tostadas. Ehhhhh. It was just like salsa and dip basically.  Spicy which I love. But still.. ehhh.. lolz.  I was so bummed though. :( because my boyfriend ordered the fuego pasta with chicken on the side (so we can share because im a vegetarian. And the waiter knows that. )  the food came looking super delicious as I was going to take a bite. There was sausages in it.............. um okay. The waiter didnt say anything about sausages in it knowing we were going to share.  :( booo.    The bill came out. It was $35.74. I had a Groupon so end up paying $5.74. :D I just left a $20.   Other than that. My boyfriend like his pasta.  Lolz.',4
'My prom date brought me here 10 years ago. Hmm...I wonder what he was expecting at the end of the night. Although he thought that tanning until he was as red as a lobster was the new black this was one of his better judgment calls.    We had a window seat and I mesmerized him with fascinating facts about the city which were on little plaques along the windows. It really took him until the end of dinner to figure it out. Anyway I am sure the menu has changed but the salad and shrimp with angel hair pasta I had that night were yummy. Cool view. I will have to come back sometime to see how the valley has changed from this view.',4
'This has been my favorite Greek place to eat for almost wow 12 years now. I first have to start with the great customer service I get every time I go there. I have brought friends and family here because of it (plus the food of course) and I get asked every time I go about how they are doing or about how my life is going. She remembers great details about her customers and now-a-days thats a rare find. She knows exactly what I am going to order (Yes Im predictable) and has it already written on a ticket before Im at the counter. Just amazing personable service.   Now to the food which is just as amazing. If you enjoy a classic gyro thats what got me hooked in the first place. The Tzatziki Sauce is flavorful and sauce like not thick and has been the best I have tasted. I love getting an extra side and dipping my fries in it or pouring it on my rice. If you want to try something a little different get my favorite which is the steak pita. The steak is marinated in some delicious concoction  and its won me for good. They have plenty of other options for people who arent adventurous in the food category like hamburgers and what-not but I havent had them. I would only imagine they are tastey if thats what you are going for ;)',5
'After checking into our lovely suite at the Montelucia my hubby said he was in the mood for some chips guac and a margarita. I think he had mistaken Scottsdale for Mexico and unfortunately the restaurant at The Montelucia (Prado) had none of the above. Instead we enjoyed a glass of wine (Riesling for me) a bowl of gazpacho and shared the snapper ceviche.  Service was a bit on the slow side but the tasty food made up for it...  We ended up back at Prado the next morning for breakfast- we were quite starving after hiking Camelback (or part of Camelback).  I was a bit disappointed with their breakfast menu. They had very few things to choose from besides the $25 breakfast buffet. I wasnt in a buffet kind of mood but it didnt seem like we had a choice. However I seemed to get the most out of my $25 after stuffing my face with an omlette mini breakfast burrito fruit yogurt parfait etc.  Our waiter did a bit of a disappearing act but fortunately we didnt need him much for the buffet.  They do have some good food but they could use some more options...and better service.',3
'Olive and Ivy is such a find in the Phx airport. Great prices ($4.00 for a glass of decent Chard) good food super friendly staff cool music and outlets under every seat...made for a pleasant 2 hour wait.',5
'Ehhh its ok. The best thing about this place is the service. We were in a large group of people and everyone was taken care of as if there were only a few of us. They even put our outside cake in the fridge for an after dinner celebration.  The food...it doesnt taste bad...and then again it isnt remarkable. I always end up (this wasnt my first visit) with the same thing Garlic Green Beans and Fried Tofu. This is the most critter-less dish i can find on the menu. I dont know how you get so much grease outta green beans and fried tofu...Im talkin pork dish grease. Ok so thats my gripe.  Im pretty sure ill go back for another birthday celebration or when theres a large group of people trying to decide what will satisfy everyone or when i need a quick lunch thats not drive thru.',3
'I was actually pretty shocked to see any negative reviews for Fate on here.  The whole bun scenario listed a few reviews down sounds like a fiasco but thankfully ive never had a negative experience there and ive been there god only knows how many times.  Fate is my favorite restaurant.  i discovered it late one night (well early morning actually) after helping a friend shoot a burlesque show downtown.  I was amazed that they were open that late (I think it was one...maybe two A.M.?).  He insisted that Id be amazed and I was.    I have had to wait a few times to get in but usually that was because it was First Friday.  Its understandable because its a small place (like most of the places downtown) and its pretty popular.  Besides you can always call ahead and make a reservation if you dont want to wait.  Its not a big deal.    The service the first time and each subsequent visit was excellent and the food was brought out ridiculously fast.  The crab puffs are to die for and I honestly have trouble narrowing down which martini is the best.  The pad thai martini is just amazingly weird enough to be good but the spicy cucumber is out of this world.  Ive tried a number of dishes but I always come back to the spicy Saigon with shrimp.  Im glad I dont live nearby or Id go there all the time.  This way its always a treat when I go.',5
'Run dont walk to Roma Garden.  You could miss this if youre not looking carefully (hint:  it faces 40th street)  as it is just a strip mall storefront but inside it is much better than expected.  Just the decor itself will wow you.  We went in without reservations and it happened to be prom night but we were seated ASAP in the front section which was just lovely.  Our server Jen and her assistant El Magnifico were so friendly super attentive even though they could have been all stressed about the big groups of prom kids in the main section.  No sweat just another night for them.  Just loved the service.  Be sure to check in on Yelp and show them the 10% off coupon.  Free amaretto at end of meal.    I guess I should talk about the food.  It was our first visit so we played it safe but the basics were good enough to plan for a return.  My spaghetti/marinara/sausage  (which was recommended by Jen when I told her I just needed to try the red sauce on my first visit)  was perfectly fine.  Hubby had stuffed peppers and we both loved them.    We like going to local places that are a bit more fancy and after being completely disgusted by Belfiore we were extremely relieved to have our faith restored in nice Italian restaurants by visiting Roma Garden. Spinatos is closer to us but this place is more fitting for date night.  The place just simply made us happy;  please go here and support them!',4
'I tried Smashburger after hearing great things from a coworker.  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the volume of ambient noise; Its very loud. The second was the prices on the menu.  I had a 1/3lb Spicy Baja burger Smashfries and a drink coming to about $11.  The burger was very tasty; Not the best burger Ive ever eaten but rather enjoyable.  The fries didnt reach my expectations; they were very oily and I ended up leaving half of them on the plate.  While the food was decent it wasnt worth $10 to me.  Ill probably eat there again but not soon or often.',2
'Love this place. Sit at the bar and hang out with our favorite bar manager Chad!  Absolutely the best service you will get in AZ oh and the food is freggin amazing too!',5
'I was here for the Yelp event recently and loved it.  The facility was great and Yelp did a good job putting together the event.  I noticed there was a lot to do there.  I am already planning to come back with my nephews so I can have fun walking around the mock grocery store.  Im also looking forward to racing my nephews through the car wash on tricycles.  Bring energy when you come and prepare to have fun.',5
'As of yet accrual stars unknown.  This is information that is nice to know (most is available other places) FIRST TIME 1) Expect to be there 4 to 6 hrs. 2) Be at door as close to opening as possable. 3) Eat before going and drink water (24 - 32 oz min) 4) if you take aspirin max 320mg within 12 hrs (some uncertainty on time could be less or more I spelt the difference) 6) bring 2 ID with address or proof of addresses.  EATING ! Food will affect your blood.  Minimum 24 hours pre-plasma/blood giving: Do not eat the goodys we all love sweets high fatty foods (anything fried) high Cholesterol forming foods.  Foods you should eat are vegetables legumes such as lentils (high in proten) dried beans grains such as oats (grits is corn).  Fruits & Avocados eat in moderation. ( sugars in fruit fat in Avocados.)   Vegetables such as Kale is high in Vitamin K this thickens the blood along with being very very healthy for you.   My normal diet is high in these foods therefor I usually 1/2 an Aspirin and several cups of water before blood tests.   These are foods high in Vit. K: Broccoli  Brussels sprouts White cabbage Cauliflower Swiss chard Chives Collard greens Cilantro  Endive Kale Leek Bibb lettuce Red leaf lettuce Green onion Parsley Spinach Turnip greens Watercress Moderation is the key.   Coffee Tea and Soft drinks with caffeine are dehydrating and narrows the blood vesicles.  Carbonated drinks are also a no no the carbonation blocks calcium from your body therefore your blood.  Calcium has many jobs.  Just do not drink any of the above.    There are fats that are actually good for you but to be safe be moderate in the good fats no bad fats.  A personal note on eggs:  production eggs you buy in the store are not the same egg that was sold 75 years ago.   Just as with us chickens eggs gets there nutrition from what goes into the chicken along with its emotional state.  No sun high stress gives you a fatty high cholesterol egg among other things that missing.  Free range natural foraging cage free carnivore chicken eggs have:   * 1/3 less cholesterol   * 1/4 less saturated fat   * 2/3 more vitamin A   * 2 times more omega- 3 fatty acids   * 3 times more vitamin E   * up to 7 times more beta carotene.  (With special diet Omega-3 fatty acids can be much higher)   The eggs sold as higher in Omega-3 is do to diet and are more expensive to produce a bargain.  VEGETARIAN EGGS are a RIP-OFF they have the lest good nutrition.  The vegetable proteins in soy is toxic to chickens therefore has to be possessed to be non-toxic but the chicken still can not digest soy protein properly it is the same as giving dairy to someone that is lactose-intolerant meds make it so they do not get sick but they still can not use the nutrition in the dairy.  The must have bug fish or animal protein it is the same as making a cat a vegetarian ......  That is the same with a chicken.  [see short 49 sec video of what a chicken wants     http://youtu.be/nZRNJPdKmVM   They will fight over it]  A personal note on grains:  most modern grains more of the gain is utilized in nutrition unfortunately that means also it turns to sugar faster and more of it then grain 75 years ago.  In other words 1 loaf of modern bread is the same as eating 2 or more loves of bread 75 years ago.  (More diabetes)',3
'Love their chipotle gyro lunch special and flaming cheese & hummus app. My sister & I love picking it up to go or eating outside with our babies.',4
'Although I havent had the pleasure of dining at Vincents of Camelback I became a fan of his little brother Vincent Market Bistro after just one visit.  Although I thought there were a few too many tables in this small space I still found it cozy and intimate.  I had a hard time deciding between trying a pizza (the Four Cheese had my attention with mozzarella bleu brie and goat cheeses with pesto) or a full-blown dinner (particularly the Shrimp Crepe with avocado corn salsa).  But the Prix Fixe won with three courses for a very reasonable price ($25 I think).    They allowed me to substitute lobster bisque for the soup offered and it was very rich and buttery and lobstery.  The halibut/sea bass duo was my preferred entree.  Perfectly cooked perfectly sized given it was sandwiched between a cream soup and dessert.  The pot de creme was surprisingly and pleasantly not chocolate.  Although I like chocolate I prefer it as an element of a dessert not the main ingredient.  Only getting too old to remember shit me cant remember the flavor..I believe it was raspberry.  What I do remember is that it was very good.  Our server was delightful in responding to our 101 questions about the menu.  It was a lovely meal overall.  Note to self:  go back soon.',4
'This place was unbelievable!  I ate lunch there today and the gluten free menu was awesome!  I had the lunch combo which included a slice of gluten free pizza a salad (I chose the Asian salad) and my drink all for $9.  The gluten free pizza was to die for!  I have been to so many places where the GF pizza tastes like a sponge.  It almost tasted like their crust was made from a potato flour and was a little on the sweet side.  The portion of salad I received with my slice of pizza was rather generous.  It was definitely enough to fill me up for the price!  I highly plan on going back here and trying their gluten free pastas!',5
'Fresh ingredients friendly service a family-run breath of fresh air to our neighborhood in Glendale! The two of us ate (take out) plenty for just over $20 plus tip. All of the sauces and things I didnt know what they were rather than describe them to me they had me try! Just like I was in someones grandmothers kitchen; a good feeling. The kitchen is right behind the counter so you see your food being prepared cooked and served. All the better to ask questions while they do it.  On the down side they were out of falafel and a few other dishes when I came in around 7pm on a Saturday evening. The place was deserted I even asked if they were open.   All in all a charming place and nice find of a new restaurant and gracious hosts. We will definitely come again!',4
'-pink drink -freaking amazing. I want to copy this for my wedding! It is tart and sweet. -fig drink - also delish -******** fried chicken-omg good!!! ******** I think they only serve this on Wednesdays but you need to get it. Its like maple fried heaven. Best fried chicken I have ever had.  -crab stuffed chicken- acceptable    so-so wouldnt order again -candlestick maker drink: ok  -beef stew ok would get again. -yellow fin was ok (the hubby liked me    not much) -pretzel bites n fondue cheese holy    yum!!! Get this as your appetizer before you get the fried chicken!',5
'If you bake or love to bake you will love this store! They have everything you could ever need to bake anything you desire.   I recently made Boston Cream Cupcakes and I purchased my frosting and Bavarian Cream to cut down on time and their filling and frostings are the best.   I just cant say enough about the items here.',5
'The Greene House - Inspired California Cuisine  What in the hell does that mean?  Oh wait it must be referring to the fish taco on the menu.  But wheres the sushi?  We all know Arizona is severely lacking in these fine culinary experiences.  Perhaps that is why the good chefs at Fox Restaurant have brought us inspired California cuisine since us Arizonans could use some inspiration.  Well hoping to be inspired my aunt and I decided a break was in order from the Kierland experience and Greene House it was.  We opted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather.  We even got the special treat of enjoying someones cigarette smoke wafting toward us while another prospective diner contemplated going in.  Greene House can boast quite an eclectic menu offering something for everyone without having to resort to the catalog of a Cheesecake Factory for example.  We opted for a roast beef sandwich and grilled turkey on flatbread.  The roast beef listed the raw or undercooked disclaimer; but in fact the beef was well done.  I would prefer it not have been chopped but with the addition of pickled red onions and fontina cheese it was a tasty sandwich.  The turkey on flatbread is billed as including baby swiss avocado butter leaf and hummus spread.  The hummus spread was what sold me on the sandwich; unfortunately I never tasted it.  Not much avocado to speak of either.  We also ordered the fries kicked up with parmesan and white truffle oil.  Certainly destination fries if youre a fan of truffle oil.  Perfectly cooked but served with ketchup.  Seriously?  Ketchup and truffle oil?  Not too inspiring on that one.  We had pretty good service overall.  But the California lifestyle took hold and our server disappeared for quite a while before bringing the check.  Perhaps he ran out to work on his tan.  Although I probably wouldnt make the drive just to dine at Greene House I wouldnt hesitate to stop in for a meal next time Im at Kierland.  Some of their entrees looked pretty appetizing.',3
'Love the special options for treats and the seats are the most comfortable in town.  Only place for movies in north Scottsdale in my opinion.',5
'This is such a nice addition to Scottsdale--------------we needed a home town coffee shop-----maybe it has others around but at least it isnt Starbucks.  We went to Pascucci with friends from London.   They asked to buy the beans and everyone of us said this is the best coffee in the valley.  You can drink this coffee straight and enjoy it or put in your cream and sugar but be sure it is one of the smoothest coffees ever-------including every European city you can name.   I like the decor the location and the product.   It will be my new local and will be used most days',4
'Heres everything you need to know:   A 16oz domestic beer is $8.25 A 24oz domestic beer is $11.25  Well ok theres other stuff you should know too. The facilities are very clean and neatly organized. The staff are friendly and helpful and you never have to go very far to buy something to eat or drink. They smoking area is actually kinda nice but not shaded and no misters (take THAT smokers!). There are bathrooms everywhere and theyre super clean! Never a line for the womens room... Whoa!  Theres a ton of free parking and outside in Westgate you have like five or six different restaurants to choose from.',4
'#1 rule: bring cash.  I love this place. I usually get the #12 Vegetarian sandwich and a Lees Coffee. Grab a fresh baguette to go or a day-old one to make bread pudding or French toast later. The fresh bread is amazing -- you could just by a baguette and some butter and go to town.  All of the pastries Ive had there have likewise been excellent. The little cream-filled cakes (deli manjoo?) are pretty tasty although Ive ODd on those before and have to take it easy. Dont order the box of 20 and try to eat it all at once!  I love the veggies (including sliced fresh jalapenos) on the Asian sandwiches and I dont know if Ive ever had any other type here. Beware the #8 Shredded Pork a.k.a pork skin sandwich... if youve never had one before it probably isnt what you expect. The cashiers generally realize your level of non-Asian-ness and ask if youre REALLY sure when you try to order it. Dont be offended theyre just making sure you get something that you want to eat. :)   It may be a cash-only establishment but the prices are very reasonable the menu is extensive and service is normally fast.',4
'This place is so 5-Stars it just never ceases to amaze me even though Ive eaten here many times!  Today for instance after claiming my usual comfortable beautifully upholstered booth I washed up in their restroom which is always kept clean even though they have more customers in an hour than many restaurants have in a week!  Then I went up & dished some of their absolutely unbeatable Hot & Sour Soup into one of their just-right sized bowls & returned to the booth.  Opening the magazine I had brought to read while eating the ideal lighting shined down on it from above.  After wiping my mouth with a napkin from their easy dispense machine right there on the table (no begging for napkins!) I went up for some great just-made Sushi & a beautiful salad put together with tasty Kim Chi nuts & Creamy Apple Dressing along with many other really good ingredients.  Yum!  Over at the REAL round Mongolian BBQ I selected from 28 ITEMS including EIGHT different kinds of meat!!  Can you imagine?¿?  Of course the chef cooked it all up perfectly!  Over at the hot tables the selections vary some from visit to visit & every dish is just the best it can be.  Some greats today were the Kung Pao Shrimp the Bok Choy in fish juice; & even the potato dish was amazing!  Also I have NEVER seen a tray allowed to run out even with dozens of customers at a time swarming around to fill their plates.  Theyre right on top of things there & also back at your table where the friendly service is consistently excellent!  Are you a dessertie?  They have lots of them but I seldom get past the TEN KINDS OF GREAT ICE CREAM!  Crazy Buffet here comes in right up there with the best Buffets of any kind in Arizona not only Chinese.  Its almost the largest (around 150 regular food items) & holds its own against the greats including Pacific Seafood The Buffet at Ak Chin & even Wandering Horse with lower prices than any of them.  Its also one of the busiest with thousands of diners weekly & its no wonder!     :-))  Weekday Lunch Buffet $7.99/$7.19 Sr.',5
'My trek to Whataburger was an artistic quest. Id never heard of Whataburger before so I thought David Foster Wallace was making it up when he refers to the Whataburger Southwest Junior Invitational in Infinite Jest (the tennis tournament is made up). When I found out it was a real place I had to come here.   It wasnt bad and kudos to the woman taking my order. She upsold me to a meal - are you sure you dont want a meal honey? Her voice indicated that she was genuinely concerned about my general hunger situation which admittedly was extremely high at that very moment. Then there was the wait outside the take-out window probably 10 - 15 minutes in total. I  figured they must be assembling one king-hell burger in there. But more likely it took that much time to fill the giant Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda. I let out an audible gasp when I saw it - holy crap it was big. Like I could have gone hiking in the desert for miles with nothing but that giant cup of soda to sustain me.   The burger was pretty big. Bigger than anything youll find at any other fast food joint and dont forget the wait I think the wait is key. Because that wait is what sets this place apart from say a Mickey Ds or an In-n-Out (which incidentally Whataburger is way better. Like the first time I ate an In-n-Out burger thats exactly what it did). So sitting outside waiting behind the big white SUV with the smokey exhaust youre inhaling for the ten minutes it takes for them to make their burger plus the ten or so minutes it takes for them to cook your own and  assemble your meal fill the giant styrofoam Whataburger cup with Fanta Orange soda and deep fry your peach pie (very tasty) lets you reflect on the state of your life in relationship to your expectation of wanting a fast food restaurant to act as an instant gratification machine when in fact by going to those other places you are perhaps missing out on all this personal attention to your burger meal soda dessert assembly (and dont forget that caring moms-like voice so concerned for your hunger situation) in the space of which time you are allowed to reach out to loved ones via your cellphone or text-messaging system (I was able to call my husband twice and read a magazine article about hiking in Tempe) and think about what you want to do next w/r/t your art and just what the fuck are you doing with your life anyway that you think waiting outside the Whataburger for ten minutes is keeping you from actualizing some potential self that may be far better served by simply having to wait a moment for your food?',3
'Overall a really good experience. If you dont know exactly where it is may take some time to figure it out (hint its not a street facing facade..door in back). But once you walk in you enter a dark romantic chill scene. The seating is a bit cramped if you havent reserved anything (so do that!) It being our second date and our first time we just had wine. They had a great selection at decent prices (per glass/per bottle). They also have a bar.  We went on a Fri and they had music as well. It was a bit loud as its a small venue but who cares! This is a great date spot or a casual spot for a group of friends. Looking forward to returning here and indulging in all they offer.  I have already recommended this!',4
'Kabuki is one of those restaurants where you walk in and expect to pay 70 dollars for a meal for two and end up paying 25 dollars instead.  I dont quite understand the whole pettiness on sushi its SUSHI. Raw fish rice vegtables and random sauces. If you dont like it then you probably should try a different roll!   As a former sushi addict I came to love this place that once fed my addiction. They have great prices on their menu items so its another excuse to be a pig and order twice as many rolls :) That is if you are not on a date you dont want your date to see your inner porker QUITE yet.. lol   This place is very modern. The view is AMAZING. It overlooks the Coyote Stadium sure its no New York City view but it beats looking at the Glendale desert.  Kabuki makes my mouth water I dont care what anyone says just because this place is beautiful and upscale does not automatically mean their sushi will not be good!   Let me make this clear Kabuki is delicious!! I use to go at least twice a week with my fellow sushi addict friends!! That says something right?? :)   In conclusion I heart Kabuki I heart their sushi I heart their ambiance and most of all I heart their prices.',5
'Was in the area and made a spur of the moment stop as we were hungry. I ordered the chili rellenos and taco plate and my husband a chimichanga plate. Both were very good! The chips were also great very light and crispy. Much better than any of the chain Mexican places. The place was small but clean and friendly. Was so glad we stopped!!',5
'Above average airport food Blanco has some tasty burritos with some upscale ingredients such as braised short ribs.  I really enjoyed the flavors and the value (weighed easily more than a pound) but it can be messy to eat on the go.',4
'Tasty fresh and savory!',4
'I recently had my wedding here this past weekend the venue was nice the food was good. However I am very disappointed in the wedding planner nadine she was very rude to all of our guest.  She was rushing everybody and running on her own time instead of ours and stressing everyone out including me the bride!',3
'Ahem.   This place turned me off. From the parking lot having valet (and almost no open spot for me to park) to the cold shoulder I got when I walked in I felt very unwelcome. Instincts took me right to where I needed to go but I got a little overwhelmed when I started to read the labels. Gin. Vodka. Brandy. Its all categorized here which is muy helpful. But I couldnt find the Aquavit. Thats when I walked to the counter and asked. Its in the back I was told. For half a second I thought he wasnt even going to show me. But he did. He pointed We have 3 kinds. Then he walked off. Uhm ok. I guess I now had a 33 and 1/3 chance of getting this right. I didnt like those odds. Nobody wants to drink shabby Aquavit.   I phoned a friend. No answer. Thats when I thought to myself You can do this. Go with your instincts. So I did. At the register I asked Out of the 3 is this the best to get? The man who had shown me to the back wall nodded. He was busy on the phone. The guy checking me out said Hes our resident Aquavit expert. Uhm ok. So this really is the best? I tried to joke. I gotta get this right I said.   He had little to say so he rang me up. I signed my receipt. He handed me the slip of paper and my new purchase and asked Is there anything else I can help you with today?  Uhm isnt that question suppose to come before youre rung up and given your receipt? Yeah I thought so too.',3
'I love this place. I wish it was a little easier to figure out the ordering situation.  The people that work here are so helpful and patient and nice! Ive always been really really overwhelmed by the menu at most locations because they dont have any descriptions next to the sandwiches but this one did- Thank goodness!! The salad i had was so fresh and the half sandwich half soup deal is really a great bargain.  im really looking forward to the location close to me in Tucson opening soon.',5
'Brunch.  11 am on Sunday morning.  Two other tables in the restaurant were occupied.  Needless to say there was no wait and we were seated promptly.  A plus.   Service was attentive but not overbearing although one of our party thought our server was overly attentive at times.  I forgive them for there being nothing much in the restaurant to do other than attend to us.   Fresh squeezed orange juice was light sweet and refreshing although I could have done without the narrow tall juice glass.   I enjoyed the mediterranean omelette and it was really lovely except for there being a bit too much salt but nothing overpowering or too detrimental.  House sausage was flavorful with good texture while the feta cheese and cherry tomatoes lightness and freshness were pleasant all pleasant additions to the omelette.  The baked grated potato was really an excellent accompaniment and I loved the crusted potato cake aspect and the cheese that topped it.  As for the yogurt and cucumber salad seemed to be well made with high quality ingredients but just not my thing--you may love it.   Portion size overall was adequate though I would have gladly traded some omelette for more potato.  All in all a pretty solid and interesting omelette made with high quality ingredients for $10.  If you toss in sitting outside on a lovely morning into the mix a pretty fair deal.  Other than the over-salting my remaining gripe may not so much be the fault of the Caffe.  The place was just so empty and quiet it took away from the experience.  The restaurant has a dark comfortable clean and modern atmosphere but when its nearly empty its a negative.  Perhaps Sunday morning is really for Tempians to sleep off the previous night and so Sunday brunch is not a priority.  Too bad; a vibrance brought by tables filled with patrons would really add to the experience.  But hopefully not so many as to add a wait...',4
'Ive been here a few times and have to say it has been a great experience every time. Ive primarily had their rocket sized cheeseburgers with bacon and everything has a home cooked taste to it. It is obvious the food is made with love here and it is always reassuring to see the owner hard at work in the restaurant serving customers not to mention cooking.  Probably the only disappointing thing is that the last time we went their cheese curds were overly salty. Note I have a HIGH tolerance for salt and this was even too much for me it was extremely over the top. Let them know about it through email and they never did respond which is disappointing but considering how good everything else is here Ill let it slide.',4
'Everything I have ever ordered here is AMAZING!! I even turned my meat & potatos husband onto this place who had lunch with me here  just to please me. He now eats his lunch here EVERY Wednesday like clockwork! We are both addicted! I adore the thai peanut bowl and hubby loves the mexicali burger. The garlic hummus is also YUMMY as is the No Harm Chicken Parm!! My only gripe is that they dont have a 2nd location in North Scottsdale!! (hint-hint!!)',5
'SUPER helpful and honest. Other places diagnosed my car with needing much more than it actually needed. Lightning Lube saved me a couple hundred dollars of unnecessary work and had me in and out quickly. This is my new go-to shop. Support family owned and local shops!',5
'Cool atmosphere good drinks and a decent late night menu. I recommend the kabob things for the late night menu (not named kabobs).   Only bad thing is that the food can be too spicy. I like spicey food but what they spice the food with makes it a little too powerful sometimes.',4
'As a shift worker I am always on the look out for a good caffeine fix.  Likewise I am obsessed with finding the best toddy in town.  With these in mind I had to try Lux.  The vibe is definitely hipster but friendly and approachable--I hate to walk in and everyone turns to ask who the hell is this guy raiding our shop.  The toddy here was good slight caramel notes and mildly bitter (in a good way).  I would grade this as the 2nd best toddy in the valley.  Oh cant forget the patio.  Love it.',4
'Ive lived in New York and LA..both major cities with lots of good hairstylists. This is by far the best hair cut Ive ever had. I actually took pictures afterwards in order to show to my stylist in DC.  The environment is ok but could be even classier. Its a guys guy kind of place--with foozball table and a pool table. I didnt partake of the beer or wine but its always a good idea.  Julie the owner is amazing and followed my instructions but more importantly she improvised based on my requests. I have some...er um...thinning hair on top and Julie did a great job giving me a haircut which didnt accentuate that.  Id fly back in to Phoenix just to go here.',5
'The area is cute and the menu is good. Parking was relatively easy.  The restaurant is pretty small but appeared cute and intimate. With all that said we ordered take out which was mediocre and waaaay overpriced for what was given.  It really wasnt very good (cold and mushy).  Pretty disappointed.',2
'The food was excellent.  The lamb chop appetizer was incredibly flavorful although it was a little gristly.  The bhindi masala is among the better bhindi dishes Ive had.  I still cant place the extra spice they put in it.  The saag ghosht was superb just really an excellent lamb dish.  Tender lamb and mildly spicy spinach gravy.  And of course the chicken tikka masala was solid.  And TT serves gajrela an Indian carrot pudding.  Its been a few years since Ive had gajrela.   I still love it.    Service was friendly and speedy.  The belly dancing with the sword was unexpected.  My only concern with TT is that if that was its Saturday night rush then I hope they are making it up during lunch.  The place was only 20% full.',3
'Im no restaurateur so this review is strictly based on a consumers point of view. When putting on different events around town Im sometimes faced with the challenge of purchasing some pretty unique items such as an alcohol pour chef hats and more. And every time Im faced with a unique purchase situation I wonder... Where the heck am I going to find this? And then...the clouds aligned and I found Andrews Restaurant Supply.   This store is like a chefs dream. At least an amateur cook who likes to call herself a chef (me!). I walk in and I see easels I see pop corn machines I see professional knife sets I set freezers I see chef supplies...theres so much to look at its almost over whelming! I know this is a store for restaurants but is it a crime for little old me to shop there too because I want to! Every time Ive visited Andrews theyve always had what I was looking for. The tools at this place make me want to cook twice as much as I already do!   In addition to amazing restaurant supplies  the staff is very friendly and I learned that Andrews is the only locally owned restaurant supply store in Phoenix. And you know how we on yelp love to support local! So regardless of the drive Andrews has made a customer out of me. And if my kitchen is fully stocked with professional tools here soon I only have Andrews to blame.',5
'Kens has been open since last September (2009) in this location but I personally have been following Ken and Amy from and to different locations for years. They are just that good! Now that they own their own shop it definitely shows their personal style and their commitment to customer service!   This is a fully equipped shop! Offering everything from the standard manis and pedis to all the little extras... up to and including waxing and facials. Staff is always friendly and although usually busy you never have to wait long if at all!   Unlike many places out there this is also gentlemen friendly... so a great place to take your boyfriend husband or male friend for a pedi that he wont feel like hes being overwhelmed with estrogen!   I drive from Tempe to go to them... have tried places closer in the past(God knows there is a nail shop on every corner!) but am always disappointed with the results from the others. Quality and the overall experience are certainly worth the extra few minutes on the road!',5
'good food late night',3
'We had dinner with about 26 people from our West Valley Meetup Group. In a private room the food was excellent the service was outstanding the wait staff was so accommodating to all of us. We will hold future events here and I will visit them more often as it had been a while.',5
'My son has been going to this dojo for several years and has really enjoyed his experience and learned a lot.  The owners and staff treat each child with respect and as an individual.  The kids groups (there are two) are typically small and allow a lot of individual instruction and ample opportunity for practice.  Finally the prices are very reasonable and the kids practice times are compatible with working parents work hours (e.g. classes are on weekend and/or early evening vs. afternoons).  I can recommend this studio whole heartedly.',5
'Well...  the only thing I can say is.... if you like your food to have one consistent flavor ...no matter what choice you make.. being  the flavor of the grill... then this place is for you. It all tastes the same to me... the same strange grill flavor.  I know its fast food... but... I will not being going back as there are plenty of other options out there.   1 star IMO.  Hatch',1
'Now I dont use any of the gear in this store really. But its a place to pass a little time out from the heat. It has everything you would need for camping boating etc. I take my little one and we walk around looking at all the stuffed animals in there life-like settings. And theres a great big aquarium tunnel of fresh water fish to see. The kids like that. Then well maybe look at some of the clothes and maybe have lunch. They have a cafe upstairs. They have many things some basic like hamburgers hot dogs salads. But also some rare like elk rabbit etc. But dont expect high marks on the food. Its more of a cafeteria feel than a cafe. All in all its just a place to waste a bit of time unless you are an avid outdoorsman.',2
'Short and sweet....  -Close to work -Lunch Specials -Pollo Magnifico -Mini Chimis w. jalapeno cream cheese  The end!  :D',4
'This is a great place to take your time and enjoy someones company. The food is fresh and the service always friendly. If you are looking to be fed fast this is not the place to go. Fondue is fun! If you have the time and the money this is a place to have a great evening.',4
'Next time I should ask them if they can tone down the chili pepper heat a bit at least for my order. The White Sands Chimichanga dinner I ordered was tasty but the heat level was a lot more than I was comfortable with and I usually enjoy spicy food. It would probably have been a much more enjoyable meal if it werent partly like torture trying to finish the fiery food. The service was very friendly and attentive and the place has a nice and informal if kitschy look.',3
'Is ok but we live too far away for just ok.  Pizza had nice flavor crust bit chewy not crisp in the middle and mushrooms not great.   Full bar but cocktail could be better.  Dessert menu looks great.  Decent neighborhood place that got overhyped by our yelp brethren.',3
'Great Mexican food at an awesome price. The patio is fairly large as well making it nice for when the weather finally cools off.',5
'If it werent for my once-a-year loyalty/obligatory appearance to the Phoenix Texas Exes college football game-watching party I would have never been scooted into this what amounts to downtrodden dive.  I feel bad for saying it because when they hosted this event they had no idea how far over their heads they would be with this contingent (particularly since it was the first game of the season and it was on PPV).  They were woefully understaffed the AC broke ran out of Shiner Bock and couldnt get the broadcast well into the Longhorns suckage of the 2nd qtr.  UT could have lost that clunker and I blame Lager Fields.  Food was okay.  Small patio for outdoor seating.  TV arrangement was serviceable.  Staff was VERY nice and apologetic.  Two stars for the effort and one for stocking the Shiner Bock.  I wont be back though.',2
'Talk about a bitchen Gyro!!! Load that thing up with the Gardien Peppers & Tzatziki Sauce!! Oh and ask for an extra Tzatziki sauce just because - its sooo good. I cant really speak for Gyros in Chicago or for that matter any other place than Phoenix so with that said. THIS PLACE RULES!!  Ive had a Gyro over at Greek Town on 7St and while the food was authentic and NO YOU CANT have any damn FRENCH FRIES with your Gyro... I dare you to even ask that dude - so while it may be authentic it was also a light weight compared to the Feast of Awesomeness that youll experience at Chicago Gyros!! and dont forget the extra Tzatziki sauce....   p.s. The Fries are damn good too!!!!!',5
'Their pizza is to die for! I cannot keep myself away from ordering the same thing every single time because its basically everything Ive ever wanted in a pizza. Their crust is on the thin side which is just my style and has a ton of flavor. Their white procida (sp?) pizza is absolutely amazing: goat cheese prosciutto and pear deliciousness!   The ambiance is great also. I would definitely suggest sitting on the patio (if its not sweltering hot outside) and enjoying some live music and cocktails. This is definitely a happy place for me:)',5
'Best pizza in the entire West Valley! Our favorite is the margherita but honestly you cant go wrong with any of them. The crust is absolutely amazing and the toppings are super fresh.  Of course no restaurant is complete without fantastic service and Sals has some of the friendliest people around!',5
'I have used Cal twice. What I like is that hes the person you talk with on the phone AND the person who shows up to do the work. Very professional good advice and even though he warns you some things may not be perfect (unknown stains behind the stain quality of carpet or fabric hes cleaning) I swear to you it is always perfect. Diligent stays long after he thought he might be done and follows up the next day. Reasonable pricing and will adjust for whatever you want done. Cant say enough good about this guy. Nancy in Grayhawk',5
'Fresh sushi and friendly staff.....best place in town for sushi (loved ZEN 32-RIP)! My partner and I have been there over ten times and weve never had bad food or service.',5
'Initially I went because of the reviews on here.  Unfortunately its not particularly special as its raved on here. I had the Bruschetta of course. But for the price it wasnt extraordinary.   The atmosphere is mildly fun and interesting. Go at night and try to go when its cool outside and sit out that would be your best experience there.',3
'I have been to this restaurant many times!  Their seafood...anything from fish to scallops to clam strips tasted fresh each and every time.  Clam chowder bread bowl is even more amazing.  You can taste real clams with great flavors and their sourdough bowl is the best I have ever had.  Everything for a very reasonable price and is often filled with senior citizens (you know its good!).  Friendly owner and workers...and they do bring your food to you when they call your number.  They also have a patio area to sit outside on a warm night.  I rarely give a 5 star to a restaurant that is not full service but I will make an exception for this place.  Think of it as a place for great fresh seafood minus the beach view and white table cloths.',5
'With its Indoor/Outdoor atmosphere very open spaces large open bar plenty of lounge spaces Tanzy set itself apart from other restaurants.  Being part of the iPic Theater allows for the ultimate Dinner and  Movie or Movie and a night out.  Excellent range in the menu offerings are sure to please more traditional Italian cravings as well as those looking for something different. An absolute must have is the Mozzarella and Prosciutto table side service!!! Everything is excellent though. The Red Velvet cake is also a definite must have.  The atmosphere at Tanzy lends itself to hanging around a while.  Absolutely Love it.',5
'If youre in the neighborhood its not full of skivers having a session. Service was friendly and ample. Food was good. Exactly the pub we needed to find. A chat with a local Barney the jig my daughter ripped into was heart felt live music and a boxty that tastes like my dad made it.',4
'How can you not love a place that offers $.75 refills on tea bought at the Fair Trade in the civic space downtown? These two places are great places for treats tea and friendly service. I rode my bike from the AZFCU to the civic space grabbed and Ice tea and some gum samples then biked through ASU to Think. By the time I arrived at the Roosevelt/Central train station i was so parched i went to this Fair Trade asked them if i could get a refill instead of wasting a cup thinking i would pay for an entirely new Iced Tea when she only charged me $.75. that was awesome!!! finally a place that is well Fair! they didnt have my favorite Banana Nut cookies but thats okay ill forgive them lol.   however if you ever see the banana nut cookies available get them fast! they are the most tasty & moist little bites of heaven you will ever eat! this place also offers tons of vegan items.   they offer free wi-fi have inside and outside seating both in front of the shop and in the courtyard right behind it too. ride a bike? youll find 2 bike racks in front and back as well. you will also find handcrafted items to purchase from around the world including music-which can be sampled on the sampler close to the courtyard. i cant get enough of their green tea but the others are deolilcious too and at only $2.25 with a $.75 refill you cant go wrong. so next time you take the train into downtown stop at the roosevelt/central station and get yourself some Fair Trade on!',4
'Windsor makes quinoa taste so good that Ive started turning down things like pulled pork and mac & cheese. Seriously. Quinoa over mac & cheese who gave me crazy pills?!   Seriously Id like to take them every day so I can continue to eat this healthy.',5
'Great food and service. Josh is so friendly. Best place for local Greek food.',5
'I kind of love QT. When I see their sign along the road I feel a sudden sense of safety like Ive been traveling for a long time but my goal is finally within reach and now I can rest. And thats just on my morning commute. Also they let me engage in my dirty habit of drink-mixing. I have created some of the most elaborate sugar-bombed bizarro mix drinks in the QT. Cinnamon banana hot chocolate mochas anyone? English toffee with a pour of amaretto creamer topped off with basic Columbian? And Im not even getting to the frozen drinks. I also think that eating the QT hot sandwiches which I am not above will preserve my body in the style of Egyptian mummies so I will be a curiosity for future generations to study and learn about our ancient culture. Im just doing my part for future generations and it tastes like a sausage muffin. All public service should be so tasty.   Totally serious note: QT restrooms are in my experience almost always clean. Best restrooms on the road.',4
'So I had this $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com that clearly stated NO EXPIRATION DATE and what happens? They wont take it. So yeah Ive had it forever and always forgot to bring it with me but thats beside the point - it says NO EXPIRATION!!! So starting off on the wrong foot we stood in the doorway for a while until I chased down a waitress to ask where we could sit. The patio and bar were full and only one table was available inside. We sat and were quickly attended to by a great server (Eddie) who was obviously super busy but never once ignored us. The food was so-so; I remember it being better in the past when this place was not nearly as busy. The calamari was a bit soggy but decent tasting and the rock shrimp tempura was slightly soggy as well but OUT OF THIS WORLD in flavor! All of the sushi rolls on the special menu were either deep fried or covered in spicy mayo. You think I kid; I dont. And honestly something tasted off not super fishy but like the Hamachi had been previously frozen for a month and wasnt fresh? Unfortunately Tammy wasnt behind the bar so I didnt stop to piss and moan and make a scene but had she been there and had a moment to chat (like she has in the past) I probably would have said something. Even though I really want to give this place 1 star for tonights several moments of WTF Eddie was a killer attentive server the food was expeditiously prepared I think Tammy is a cool chick and the all-day happy hour and sushi costs cant be beat anywhere in this state. I used to think Pearl was a underrated hidden gem but apparently some of the quality has suffered with the increase in business. Too bad now its just a place you can say you get what you pay for and that is truly unfortunate.',2
'Just opened and not quite all there yet. But its promising because its the most energetic place at Desert Ridge right now.  The bartenders danced on the bar. The music (mainly dance and house) was loud. Service was ok. They still have construction going on in the patio area.  Overall much better than the tgi Fridays they replaced at this location.',3
'This is hands-down the coolest library Ive ever visited. A rockin building a really cool water display with the stair case and several self check-out stations. Theres also a concierge of sorts as soon as you walk in the building - the building is huge and can be intimidating - this person answers questions and points you in the right direction.   The top floor is quiet for hunting books another floor seems to be dedicated to high school students and mentoring and another for kids. Move between floors via the staircase over the water display or in the glass elevator with a view.   Use your library card to search for and reserve books online (card not needed to search...only to reserve materials for pick-up).   A big plus is the amount of covered parking.   Loss of a star: no drive-up book return and they dont proctor exams for distance education grad students.',4
'Very fast super helpful looking for a juice that helps with detoxing after drinking. Plus the juice taste great! I am a regular juice drinker and I would rank this one higher than most. Plus it is connected to True Food a great restaurant with a great concept!',5
'This revu is for the one in the back of cfc not sure if this is the same place. Ordered a Guinness n some hot buffalo wings while I got my ipad skinned. Both were tasty. A big place lots of games w/o the dive bar smell vid poker trivia n lots n lots of tvs. Nice casz place. Visit it.',4
'This is by far the best churasscaria I have ever tried. Brazilian bbq at its best! Everything is perfectly seasoned but my personal favorite is the top sirloin.   The sides that come with the meal are great too.. there is cheese bread fried plantains and these two other things..... very delicious.  The salad bar has plenty to choose from try a little bit of everything. Great selection. The service is ok/good but occasionally we had to flag our waiter down. Reservations are highly recommended because this place gets packed.   The night my boyfriend and I went we saw two players from the Golden State Warriors and we saw Muhammed Ali. Apparently famous people come in all the time.',5
'Food was not good. Wife said the chicken tacos tasted horrible. Cheese enchilada tasted like dirt. The bean burrito was ok but I had them add sour cream and guacamole.  The prices were way too high for this low quality of food. I should have known better than to eat here when i saw they dont accept credit cards.  When an owner is too cheap to pay visa/MasterCard 2% of a transaction you know they are going to be cheap with the food quality too.',1
'Staying at the Embassy Suites hotel noticed the Omaha Steakhouse downstairs.  I know what youre thinking Hotel?  Steakhouse?  Good?  Well it was.  I wasnt expecting a whole lot however after a long day of travel with the family we ate here when we arrived.  Kenneth good really good care of us.  The options were decent food quality was good and the prices were not prohibitive.    Funny enough nobody ordered steak I enjoyed the Salmon my wife had the shrimp quesadilla my son had the cheeseburger.  No complaints good fresh quality.  The bread was also fresh from the oven and quite enjoyable.  On the second night I did order the steak salad.  Probably the best one Ive ever had.  Not an overly expansive wine list but certainly gives you lots of choices for general varietals.   If youre in the area or visiting the mall next door (dont know what the mall is but it looks popular) stop in forget its an Embassy Suites Hotel and enjoy lunch or dinner.  (not to disrespect the Embassy Suites in any way however if someone told me theres a decent steak house at an Embassy Suites I might smile at them with an uh huh.)',4
'Played there a couple of days ago. Not impressed to say the least. Facility is in fantastic shape for oversseding this time of year. (mid october) We showed up at 6 am for our 640 tee time. (thats plenty to get warmed up get a cup of coffee and use the bathroom before teeing off.) Clubhouse was empty. Ya know that xmas story when they say... Nothing was stirring not even a mouse? Yea thats what it felt like. Finally after siiting around for 30 mins the pro shop opens. We pay for our rounds and get 10 mins to hit some balls.   *10 mins later*  We get to the tee box no starter. Even the groundskeepers were running behind. Not a big deal the guys were cool. With my limited spanish I was talking to one gentleman and he was talking about how one course is down and its a lot of work for them at the moment. I get it. Theyre busy its my day off no big deal. The pace of play was slow because each tee box we got to were being groomed the tee boxes were on the side of the tee box so we had to slow down a bit. Whos fault was that? Ours of course. Golf course was in great shape the views are amazing (I like Sun Ridge Canyon more personally.)  *4 hours later*  Get done with the round go inside for some food. Order drinks... 1 coke an arnold palmer a lemonade and a water. Server got 2 of 4 wrong. awesome! We order food and the server says Would you like to take care of that with a credit card or membership? Well in the REAL world we wait till after our food arrives to usually pay... if you want a good tip anyways. Maybe I am in a different country its otherwise... I answer Ill take care of it with cash. Heres his god to honest answer.  We do not accept cash.  What?  Last time I checked this is America and its safe to accept legal tender issued by the Federal Reserve buddy.  Get the food fries were the best part.    Get the check and the 20% is automatically added. Wow. We had a party of 3... not 8 or 10 3.... Three. no wonder there was bad service.  TL-DR?  The service all around needs to be stepped up if. Its too far to be treated that way. But then again if memberships is all they want maybe theyve found their niche. Old people all around a nd a lot of people who dont care. Nice business plan guys!  Ill pass next time.',1
'I really like this place and so does my family. I have only eaten in the restaurant once and I cant really remember it but we almost always order takeout. Their pan-fried noodles are fantastic especially when the noodles are extra crispy! Their pineaple chicken is so yummy and the black bean shrimp is DELICIOUS!! Their fried rice is amazing especially if you get the house fried rice with the pork in it. It also comes with 1 or 2 shrimp on the side. Really really good. My Dad used to travel to China a lot with work and says this place is as authentic as it gets in the area.',4
'If I could give this place no stars I would.  Worst Mexican food Ive ever had.  While ordering a carne asada burrito I asked what came on it... apparently only carne asada and pico... had to add guacamole.  The place seemed busy but now I have no clue why... the burrito was as small as a taco bell burrito and honestly taco bell tastes better!  The carne asada was dry and over seasoned and had a very small spoonful of guacamole and I got charged 90¢ for it.  Ridiculous.  I was still hungry after and thats never the case at real Mexican taco shops. Ill never go back.  I may be spoiled on San Diego taco shops but even Filbertos is a gazillion times better than this place... what a joke.  Oh I forgot to mention how annoying the lady was calling out orders... Im disabled so it takes me longer than 3 seconds to walk up to pick up my tray she just kept yelling my order number out.  I dont understand why this place has so many good reviews.. these people obviously dont know what good Mexican food is.',1
'Stopped into Bed Bath & Beyond with the Princess to buy a birthday card and on the way out decided we were hungry. (Yes BB&B has cool cards-check it out no charge for that tip :)  Pulled out the IPhone and went directly to Yelp to find a cool new lunch place.  Salsa Blanco had four stars and was on the way home why not?  Definitely worth the four stars and maybe 4.5. Great $6 lunch special with a taco rice and beans large drink chips and salsa bar (theyll give you more chips if you run out (they actually come to your table and ask you if you need more or anything else which is cool considering you order at the counter.  I love ice tea and they have fresh brewed regular passion fruit and mango.  Salsa bar has mini bowls to bring the salsa back to your table and the salsa was terrific a number to choose from including hot mild fire roasted salsa verde and pico.  The food was wonderful the service was quick and genuine and the place was spotless.  Excellent decor great TVs on the walls without getting in the way. Clearly a ton of pride of ownership in this business which you just dont see a lot of these days.  As Arnold said Well be back.',4
'Its a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.  First things first: If youre perception of Japanese Cuisine is Sushi and Hibachi then this is probably NOT the place for you. The sushi selection is not extensive theyre more focused on Traditional Japanese Cusine.  The restaurant is not asthetically pleasing it has a 1980s feel to it but the food is everything youre looking for and more!   Its totally worth stopping by if youre homesick for japanese food.',5
'The food here is amazing.  They have vegan vegetarian options which is so refreshing!  I have eaten there three times and it has been great every time.  The prices are great too - $7 and under!',5
'I noticed the sign for Shakey Jakes before it even opened. I waited paitiently for it to wait... I love barbeque! :) When it finally opened my mom and I tried to get some grub there when we walked up the cutest little boy came out of the resturant and told us they were close and would be open again tomorrow. We left disappointed but still wanted to give Jakes a try.  Over a month later we finally did get a chance to do just that.  We entered Shakey Jakes and saw a nice new & clean place. There was a large counter and several red t-shirt wearing workers dishing up what looked & smelled like yummy barbeque. We waited in line and were handed menus. The walkways were narrow and left a small amount of space to sit. We were feeling the scrunch! We then sat down with our menus and chose our meals.  I went back to the register & was disappointed in the fact that they didnt have any more MacNCheese and there was some miscommunication when it came to my moms order. I thought it came with Fries... and it didnt it comes with a side dish. My mom wanted Cole Slaw AND fries... instead I accidentily ordred JUST cole slaw... but they charged me an extra fee for the cole slaw... so really I just got screwed out of a side dish and it was pretty much downhill from there.  I didnt see the lil baskets of utensils and lids and straws on top of the very tall deli case. I had to take our recipt and the cups and I pourd our drinks and sat down. The TVs were SO damned loud we were shouting at eachother. I wanted to scream can you PLEASE turn that down?! My mom had to use the rest room and I told her she needed a key which I learned from a previous review.  Anyway finally our food came and our order number was called and I got up thinking I had to bring it to the table when their server told me to sit down and that shed bring it to us... ummm... okay? but as she did she told us that the utensils were by the register. WTF?! ARGHHH!! I was JUST there!! It was ackward uncomfortable annoying and frustrating.  So i got up AGAIN if I could have just picked up my own order I could have also gotten my utensils in one big graceful swoop. I THINK the owners need to give out those lil numbers for their tables think Carls Jr. So theres no more confusion. AND give out those lil bags with utensils napkin salt & pepper packets. Because Im 56 and I had to get on my TIPPY Toes to see what the hell was in those baskets! Also I ordered two medium sodas and none of their lids fit. They were TOO small or TOO large!  The cashier was really nice but the smaller things made this place intolerable. I couldnt walk to our table without hitting EACH and every single table and chair... ugh thats the last thing I need. a reminder that maybe having yet another meal out is the LAST thing I should be subjecting my body to.  I sat down and looked at my plate the fuck?! I ordered pork ribs and they gave me beef. I looked at the recipt and it said... beef. *harsh sigh* lucky for them they both cost the same! I remembered reading their sign underneith the cashier that said theyd be happy to help you out if theres anything wrong with your order IF the food was untouched and IF you still had your recipt. sooooo... because the cashier hit beef instead of pork and I paid - I was screwed.  Choosing to just go with it I opened up my side dishes and the yams were good. nothing great but still good. The cole slaw was way too sweet for me. The corn bread was good!! The highlight of the meal! their cornbread is better than LoLos! There I said it! I just wish Shakey Jakes would make theirs bigger. The ribs were VERY good they had a serious smoke ring and the sauce had a nice bite to it. My mom didnt care for her sandwich she said there wasnt enough sauce and that the meat was very fatty. She liked the yams and the coleslaw. We both agreed that the peach cobbler was YUMMY! I just wish they baked it longer.  When we left I was full and not as aggravated like I was before. I do want to give Shakey Jakes another chance (maybe without my mom). To my yelpers if you go - be sure the check your recipt get your utensils right after you order & expect a server to bring your food when its done.',3
'We are renting a unit since September 2010 for almost the price of other storages at outstanding service and facilities.  We really appreciate Judy with such a helping heart. Our experience is wonderful with C3Storage.',5
'When everyone in this place is Hispanic and we are the only Caucasians in the place we figured this has to be authentic! The food was great! The service was great! And they serve COKE not pepsi so that is always a huge thumbs up. I had the USA Torta which is like a sandwich breaded chicken ham pineapple and cheese with a chipotle sauce lots of food and very good...I took 1/2 home!   I had passed this place 100 times recently and the parking lot seemed always busy. We love Mexican food so I was hesitant since I remember being a kid and going to this place when it was JBs for breakfast with my grandmother. Place was great and will for sure back to try something else.',4
'First thing - we arrived and espresso was not available because the machine was not warmed up. Thats ok it was early and we could wait for the crepes to be served before going back for coffee.   Something that was off-putting was the attitude of one of the employees. Blowing off steam about customers is fine but blowing off steam about customers when other customers are around is not fine. Apparently a woman who had ordered before us inquired about the chai she was owed but didnt receive because the machine wasnt up for the day yet. Employee 1 asks employee 2 - did you catch her name? Employee 2 says yeah annoying.   Get it you guys the customer was annoying for asking about her drink when she was already told it couldnt be made? So cool so clever you dudes!  I was excited about the crepes. I like crepes but these were not crepes. The crepe was the consistency of a hard overcooked tortilla and really difficult to cut through. I ended up picking it up and eating it like a burrito. The innards of the thing were good and thats where the two stars come from.  The coffee was average. In the valley there are scores of independent coffee I can choose from; in cases where the coffee is completely awesome I will brave whatever weather and douchebaggery to get a cup. I cant say I will brave either for this coffee.  Its hard for me to write this mediocre-scored review because I really like to support businesses that are not owned by giant conglomerates. This place has the potential to be awesome but I wasnt impressed.',2
'This place is a wonderful break from the chain coffee shops.  They offer a great selection of coffees gelatos and baked goodies.  I loved the coconut bread.  The atmosphere is so relaxing I really think I could of fell asleep in there.  The owners are super friendly and the shop is also kid friendly once a month they have this guy called super dave come out and play music for the kids.',4
'Really cool place especially when its decorated for Christmas since I dont think theres a square inch inside without a light on it. It is dive bar style but for what it is its great.',4
'Start the night off with a Long Island here. They are legit.',4
'Yes the buffet is huge but honestly it wasnt very good! Especially for 22.50 a plate.',2
'Haikus... or rather Araikus  *** Homemade cartoon bread On which you can lay your head Or toads in the hole *** Sukiyaki Beef a sandwich that will keep you coming back for more *** Bring a few pastries  to your next dinner party impress all your friends *** Order your loved one a special Im Sorry cake if you were a jerk *** The Arai Brothers will hook you up with sweetness and wont let you down *** Try the curry pan I really think youd like it be adventurous!',5
'The few stir-fried items I tried here once were flavorful.  Wished I couldve tried the eggrolls but food allergies make me avoid them pretty much anywhere.  I read this venue is run by relatives of those that run Cyclo a supposedly more upscale venue in Chandler.  I need to go back and try the pho and perhaps the che 3 mau if its on the menu...',3
'This place is average. It is along a busy street but the inside is quaint. The service was a little slow but friendly. The hours are from 5pm-9pm most days. We were here on a Sunday night and it was not very crowded.  I had the calamari pasta special in a spicy sauce. The sauce was spicy indeed but I would have liked it a bit thicker. It was runny and not very bold in flavor. There was a good amount of calamari though (sautéed not breaded). Good neighborhood place but I would not come out of my way to eat here.',3
'Unlike one of the reviewers who had so many negative things to say I think Chipotles portions are indeed huge and extremely generous. I love the customer service I receive everytime I come here. The staff is always very sweet upbeat and fun!  Chipotle is by far my favorite place to eat because they are organic. Food with Integrity indeed.   As far as extra servings Ive never been charged extra for anything. Perhaps thats because I treat people with respect while some might bark out demands. Either way Chipotle is awesome... and their guac kicks major ass!  Hooray for yummy chicken salads with pico!!',5
'It smells like cigarets and beef jerky and the security guards here are mean',1
'Woohoo is right!  This place is awesome.  If you are interested in great Vietnamese food try it out.  I will not lie you will not be wowed by the level of service or the ambiance.  The food speaks for itself.  My wife and I have left each time with the cheapest lunch/dinner we have ever had and still were completely satisfied.  Everything on the menu is worth trying and comes to you fast and fresh.  The only draw back is no beer but hey plenty of that elsewhere.  To sum it up no frills great food easy on the wallet.',5
'Weve been there several times... the food is always delicious and very affordable.  The staff is helpful and friendly.   So nice to have a good  Mediterranean restaurant in the neighborhood.',4
'This restaurant is really just medium. It has a great location but I sort of find it very over rated. Portions are tiny for their price and service could be more attentive.  It isnt a bad place but there are much better ones around',3
'This is the only place I now watch movies. Its clean good food great drinks good service and no screaming babies. Its pricey but Im willing to pay it so I can enjoy watching the movie instead of wondering when the kid behind me will stop kicking my seat.',5
'I had a $20 Groupon for this place so I decided to try it out on Friday. The food was awesome! The portions were huge too! I had 4 meals for a little over $20. I ordered the half rack ribs with two sides.  I also ordered the beef brisket. The ribs were meaty tender and had good smoky flavor. I typically dont like my ribs swimming in BBQ sauce and was kind of disappointed to see sauce slathered all over the ribs but It worked. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were and the sauce was not overwhelming at all. I ordered a half rack but it seemed that there was a racks worth of ribs (they must be some huge racks)! I will definitely be trying this place again!',4
'Who doesnt love the cheesecake factory?  Its huge booklike menu consists of something for everyone.  Start off with one of their many signature cocktails.  My favorite appetizer is the chicken lettuce wraps.  They offer huge salads sandwiches burgers and entrees.  Oh yeah and they also serve cheesecake!',5
'Nice rooms at a reasonable price.  This location is 5 years old at the time of this review yet it looks newer than that. All of the amenities that you could want and everything appears to be clean and well kept. The room was spacious and well appointed with plenty of pillows and toiletries. There was also a microwave refrigerator and a coffee pot. If you have service needs you may want to look elsewhere as there doesnt seem to be much in the way of staff but I didnt have any problems.  The full breakfast in the lobby cafe was good @ about $13 and you may want to look for rates that include breakfast to save a couple $s.',4
'We had never been to this restaurant before but it was highly recommended by some of our Arab friends. Several people at our group bough a Groupon for this first experience. Service was mediocre i expected much more for the price the waitress took a very long time to come take our order (there were only three other tables in the entire restaurant.) I looked at an empty glass of water numerous time and when we asked about dessert the waitress told us that we could get up and go look at the display! Food was delicious though Ill give the kitchen staff that much.  When it came time too pay the waitress took the first bill along with the groupon charged it and then proceeds to tell the rest of our party that she can only accept one Groupon per table. So not only did I pay for the Groupon I also paid for the full price of the meal!  The food mightve been delicious but it is not worth the terrible service. Will never go back to this establishment an will not recommend it to anyone else.',1
'THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!  We came early so it was quiet but this place is a foodies dream! Original food combinations amazing martinis and a waitstaff that is very competent and funny. Dont be afraid to take risks.',5
'This place is great... parking is so easy since the renovation and of course everything in the store is why I come.  Granted I dont live too far so its fairly convenient but I look forward to as I tend to find something new and delicious every time.  The staff is also super friendly and typically youll find the same folks working (a huge plus).  If you havent tried their Falafel and Tatziki sauce its a must for any vegetarian or someone looking for Arab food!',4
'No more fingerling potato appetizer? :[  Been here about 4 times. It is a hit or miss with service. They have decent drinks though nothing amazing just decent. Their salads are big sized portions and very delicious. I think what makes us continue to go here is happy hour prices with the pretty view from the side bar...',3
'one of the most beautiful views in phoenix but food is just so-so catering to rich blue hairs escaping from their posh fountain hills bungalows. nothing new in this new american. just standard safe recipes for standard safe customers. meh.  #wynd is spelled W.I.N.D. #hostess reservation book is on the opposite counter. stoopy ass in your face for do you have a reservation and what is your last name #hostess sets the negative tone with i see you requested a window table but weve already given them all out. --not necessary because one wall of the restaurant has been rolled away to reveal the beatiful view. EVERY table is a window table.  --safe wine list with all your corporate favorites but featuring some Arizona wines ?! go on the adventurous side with a Franciscan Cab. (rolling eyes)  #smoked salmon and spinach *casserole* is what it should have said. not fresh gecky and crumby on top. yuck. #caesar salad. meh. no pepper grinder in sight. none offered. (suspect its too spicy for blue hairs so they stopped it long ago) #lamb shank with mashed and gravy could serve 3. doggie bag it for fidos feast  #no fresh mint on property. just what you see on the menu please. (a.k.a. NO SUBSTITUTIONS) #no espresso machine on property just drip. (blue hairs drink decaf dont you know!) #creme brulee with butterflied strawberry. meh. so 15 years ago.  IF ONLY... One could transplant Kais kitchen and staff to this view and location youd have a dining destination worthy of a plane ticket from *anywhere*. Dont get me wrong Kai is still worth the plane ticket from anywhere.',2
'Ever since I left San Diego for Arizona Ive been looking for a Vietnamese place that has my favorite pho dish pho bo kho.  For some reason no one around here seems to have it...  ...except Pho Ao Sen.  And let me tell you its not just the fact that I havent had it in a year that made it taste so phenomenal.  The broth had that nice thick heartiness that this stew-like pho should have full of flavor.  There was ample meat just the right amount of rice noodles and all the sides were very fresh.  Also the nuoc mam chicken wings were a fantastic appetizer.  Crispy hot perfectly seasoned and just the right amount of spiciness.  Nom.  This is now my regular stop for pho in the Phoenix area!',5
'I had an outstanding first experience here this past Monday partly due to the fact that it was Free Fry Monday where you get free fries with any burger purchase before 3pm.  Since they took care of the fries I opted to add the Nimans Ranch bacon to my burger and forego a delicious looking milk shake... this trip.  I learned that they have a gluten-free bun option which is a pleasant surprise for an in-and-out style burger and will try it on my next trip.  The staff was extremely pleasant - welcoming on my first visit and Im pretty sure every single staff member asked me what I thought and they even addressed me by my name.  I highly recommend this place and will be back!',5
'I love this place. Love the Pasta El Greco so yummy. Just simple garlic/butter pasta. The family who runs the place is awesome. The one and only waitress Tess is incredible and mom Sophia can be quite a riot. For anyone who thinks they are gruff or bothered by the yelling and plate slamming in the kitchen this is music to my Italian ears. Mediterraneans are like this we love laugh and play loud. Its very typical and really is no slight against the customer.  Just give it a try. The spanakopita is awesome you MUST try the Saganaki (its just a big dish of yummy broiled melted cheese) and anything else you might want to try. Its small and wonderful just as it should be. Tell Tess hi and wave to Sophia (she doesnt really talk much but boy can she yell in the kitchen!). Just take a menu and grab one of the very few tables and enjoy!',5
'Fast efficient and friendly service.  My spa pedicure included an amazing hot rock calf massage.  Polish lasted a good 3 weeks before chipping.',4
'I would give this place two stars but since Joe is such a great figure for the community it is a 3 star place. The food is average tasting not much flavor. I went there today for the 5th time ever hoping it will be tastier but that is not the case. Its not a bad place not just one I would desire to go to. The best bbq in AZ is Bobby Qs on the westside.',3
'They get bonus points because they know how to do a proper CLAW NAIL. I stumbled upon this place simply due to the fact that I went the day before to get my nails done somewhere else and they turned out HORRIBLE. She did not know how to do claws and instead of just saying so she attempted and failed and I was left to pay for something that looked HORRIBLE. Mind you it was MUCH more expensive than this place. When I came here he took them off and gave me what I much so wanted. I LOVED them! They arent hard to maintain either and you can still get things done... except for typing on a PC that was bit of a challenge.. but no problem typing on my Macbook. Anyway the service is good I recommend going early in the morning and not on the weekends. They have good service and the prices arent very high. She even waxed my eyebrows and she did a good job! BONUS POINTS because she filled them in for me after wards! I dont wear acrylics anymore and I dont live in Phoenix so I dont go anymore but I do recommend this place if you dont live too far.  Four stars because one first impression the english barrier is real.',4
'Tonight I dined here with friends for a Dining Out for Life get-together. I had the Latin Passion salad which was so good that Im planning to have it as my main meal next time I come here. I also had the blue corn enchilada - truly scrumptious! Service was efficient even though this was a busy night. It was a really tasty meal and  Im glad  that I now live near this restaurant!',5
'My favorite neighborhood restaurant. Food is awesome and the staff is very friendly. Green Chili Pork and the Big Ass Burger are amazing with a Goose Island Belgian Style Ale.',5
'Love this place! Go here all the time and the ladies are so nice! This was the first restaurant we found when moving to this side of the valley and we have been extremely happy with both the service & food. We are never disappointed and we would recommend Golden Harvest to anyone!',5
'10 points for the free day pass while staying at a nearby hotel. As a former member of this location the facilities are always well kept. There is a good redundancy of most of the equipment/weights. Peak times definitely have the meat market feel but overall a quality gym for the $$$',4
'Super cute.. The staff are all extremely friendly and helpful.. I love the atmosphere of the place .. I come into town every other week and this is my first choice of where to stay..',5
'I eat there all the time almost once a week. I love sitting at the bar and watching the kitchen. They have a great porterhouse that my daughter & I love to share AWESOME!  I usually have their seared Ahi salad ( salad is a little plain) and a side of vegetables. Love the variety of fresh vegetables. Also just recently tried their double bone in pork chop-very good. Service is usually good not stellar.',5
'Went here while on vacation in Phoneix based on seeing it on Man vs Food. Could not have been more impressed. Food was amazing. Far above expectations.  The torta was huge and delicious. Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic authentic meal at a good price!',5
'This is a Starbucks location close to home that has a Drive-Thru. It can be a bit awkward if you come from the side of McKellips since it curves to the left if youre ordering coffee via Drive-Thru.   Parking lot here is a bit small but usually never have any problems. I havent had any major issues with my drink orders here; however sometimes it can take a bit longer during the AM hours than the evenings.   Free WIFI and theres also patio seating.',5
'beer is good. food is not.',3
'Very nice and clean. At the top of every hour you have to get out! This is awesome in my opinion reapply sunblock or go to the bathroom for kids! ;)',4
'I think that everyone hates going to see the dentist. I know I always have since I was a kid but when I had came here for the first time my thoughts of seeing the dentist has changed. Dr. Allen is awesome possum. I felt no pain whatsoever and the best part i was out in an hour. The girls in office are super nice n friendly. I just found my regular family dental.',5
'Wonderful and beautiful upscale restaurant on the 15th floor overlooking the gorgeous valley. Private booths and outdoor seating available. Pricey but worth it.',5
'Good food and a friendly staff typically make for a positive dining experience El Bravo delivers on both fronts.    On my latest visit I opted for the green chile popover it was very good.  The popover bread was perfect and the green chile was very tasty and pretty spicy.  Ive had the bean and cheese popover and the sweet one as well both are great.  Ive ordered just about everything on the menu and have never left disappointed although that may have something to do with the delicious cookie they give you with your ticket.',4
'I was very excited to finally find a self-serve frozen yogurt place!  Sorry but it was totally not what I expected. The yogurt tasted like the ice creams/froyo you get at buffets. Im not saying its bad but it definitely cannot compare to the Yogurtlands or the Pink Berrys.  My favorite is just the plain tart w/o toppings but this didnt have the right flavor nor the texture. I also tried vanilla chocolate and mint....which all tasted more like ice cream than yogurt.  They did have mochi topping so A+ on that and their other toppings all look very fresh. Ill come back again since its right next to the gym but I hope in time theyll improve their yogurt ingredients!',2
'I have been doing business with Foothills Garage Door and am very pleased with the service that I have received. Steve is honest and points out the options with no pressure to make a decision immediately. He is timely and lets me know that he is on his way. He cleans up and even takes the trash with him.He takes pride in his business and I would recommend him highly to other customers.',5
'I love chipotle so good. Sometimes the line is long around lunch and dinner time. If youve had this place before you would understand why. Its a little expensive but it really good. I just wish they would dive you a little more meat.',5
'Went to Matts after checking on Yelp when we landed at Phoenix airport.  It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews. The restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I cant imagine really long waits.  By the way dont go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and theyll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).  The room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didnt have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus rude customers or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.    The food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best Ive tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes buttery goodness and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.    Overall the experience at Matts was excellent and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding the conditions for waiting the parking and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars.',4
'I predict that the Mondrian is on its way to becoming something fabulous. Its not quite there yet but I can feel it in my stylish bones.  OK heres the deal. Im in Scottsdale on business during all that unpleasant football madness. What did the call it the Fiesta Bowl or some such. Youve got fatheads in polo shirts from all over the Midwest read Ohio dropping down like a flock of pelicans and all of these tractor-pull millionaires have eaten up every resort hotel in town. So instead of staying where I want to stay I have to hunt around for an alternative. This brings me to the Mondrian.  It figures that there are rooms available because it would force Bob to speak French which of course they are loathe to do as they follow their Ohio State Buckeyes (to defeat). Fine with me. I grab a weeks worth of room.  I get there and the Hollywood in me is immediately satisfied. So let me tell you about the rooms. Theyre all black and white. The top half of the room is white and the bottom half just below waist level is black. Every room has a 42 inch flat panel TV with pay per view. Theyre not HD however and you cannot play DVDs on them but it makes a huge difference anyway. Beats the hell out of the Marriott.   The bathrooms are stylish and there is a big fat mirror for conceited people like me. On the left bathroom wall there is a galaxy of hooks for all of your clothing. The bathroom has a sliding door.   Its all very modern and very chic and conducive to making you think about bedding starlets but in the end its not extraordinarily comfortable. Really not for the business traveler more for the guy who wants to look like Tom Cruise and all such babeage attracted to such guys. If youre driving a rental car you will feel out of place unless of course you are as excruciatingly cool as some people I know.   Still you cannot deny the aura. The pool the staff the restaurant the valet parking the dramatic lighting. Its all very Euro. You half expect to run into Pierce Brosnan or Elizabeth Shue up in here. Of course you wont but all their wannabes will be hanging out here as soon as they finish construction. Ill drop by just to check that out.',4
'Sunday Brunch was good...not great but good.  The food was tasty and they seem to use high quality ingredients but there was just something missing to push it over the top and give it 5 stars.',4
'Good meal but the service was terribly terribly slow.  They were quite busy but several other tables that were seated well after us received their main course before we even had our salads and soup.',3
'Hooray!!! It seems at though SUL (as its called in the comedy circle) worked out their kinks now that its been open for several months. Seating was quick service was attentive and everything just ran smoothly. Im glad too because the acts were all hysterical.  You can bet that this will be my #1 comedy club to go to in the Valley. If you check their website there are a LOT of amazing acts coming up too! If you get on their mailing list you get specials texted to you. Sometimes its for a free show. Score! Tip: Park in the garage UNDER CityScape. They validate. There is also a monthly showcase of local comedians.',5
'First off Ive read some of the comments about the rules being crazy - and I guess Im just one of the growing minority thats actually OK with being without my cell phone for a few minutes...or if i need to make a call i take my call outside.  Its the rude & indignant that seem to be upset about this and the sad thing is Ive seen management remove people from the restaurant because the patron is incapable of following the simple rule of courtesy: no cell phones.  Beyond that if you cant put your cell phone down long enough to enjoy the best pancakes around then you should probably take your happy a$$ down to Villiage Inn or some place that clearly tolerates you talking on your phone at full volume.  The full stack of blueberry pancakes (with blueberries baked right in to the pancakes) and a side order of bacon (served up by Cat the Killer Waitress) is the best breakfast I can imagine.  And how about that blueberry syrup with a healthy dose of blueberrys?  this isnt just blueberry flavored syrup theres more blueberries in the syrup!  ive been coming here for years (and to the one on Greenway Parkway before it closed) and will continue to recommend it to people...along with the necessity to leave the technology at the door.  Gah get over it people its time to eat food not yap on your phone!  There are several other places you can go if you need to look (and apparently sound) important.',5
'Great lunch spot away from Downtown Phoenix.  I love their salads!',4
'great place! the food is always good and the staff are so friendly and welcoming. They have great refreshing iced tea. Its just your basic tea but its always good.  Pretty much any dish you order will be good. A lot of their dishes are loaded with bits of garlic.  They have great lunch specials and their prices are very reasonable.',4
'The steaks were great - we had filet mignon and ribeye - well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  That said the steak tartare lacked any flavor and the signature lobster gnocchi side was really overcooked and heavy.  The smores cake tasted liked a chain restaurant dessert.  But the entire experience was ruined by the duo singing/playing in the bar.  The noise level was extreme throughout the restaurant-  a woman at the next table was literally yelling to be heard and so we were (unfortunately) privvy to her entire conversation.  We could not relax and enjoy our own conversation and the band very bad so it was not even a pleasure to listen.',2
'The Bakery is closed. Sign says they are looking to open next week and another says they are looking for a baker. No idea how old the signs are.',4
'This might surprise you but this place doesnt have servers. I was expecting a sit-down-and-order experience but was wrong and Ive talked to others whove thought the same thing (there are places to sit its just more like a deli than a restaurant). Still that shouldnt put you off...they make great sandwiches and on Mondays they have GREAT lunch specials!  Sometimes there is live music which is real nice (especially if the performer is attractive and sometimes they are).  When I go I usually order the Avacado Sandwich or the Briesciutto.',4
'I like this place. No big surprises here. Decent drinks at a decent price. Cool vibe. Everyone having a good time. If I lived here Id be a regular.',4
'Wasnt expecting anything spectacular here but I was pleasantly surprised. Its a build your own roll place with pretty good quality. With the selections you can only produce the rolls you may find in a grocery store but at a better price. Definitely a great quick meal place.',4
'Myself and my boyfriend went at the very beginning of happy hour (3 4 PM ish?) on a Friday to try Ra out and it was amazing. I feel it is better than the Sushi 101 near campus. Lower lighting cobblestone-type floors modern decor. We were seated right away from walking in no appointment needed beforehand or anything. Our waiter was great and recommended to us what we should try. We were seated at the sushi bar so we even got to see our food get made and interact with the sushi chef and got recommendations from him based on what we liked already. I ended up getting the Calimari rolls and my bf had the Crazy Monkey roll. We sampled each others dishes...amazing. Calimari rolls were crunchy and perfect like the sushi version of a crispy chicken sandwich. The monkey roll was dense and interesting with a very unexpected palette of taste (there was mango inside it too!) Aesthetically amazing and tasted the same :)',5
'Good bagels and Id recommend for some breakfast nosh.',4
'Amazing honey hot wings! Not easy to eat when the restaraunt is just as hot as the wings.... miserable! Not sure if it was the volume of people present or if the A/C was down. Ick.',3
'the sun shines again when i eat a ritos green chili burrito and double rainbows appear when i eat the tacos.',5
'I dont even know where to start...which is a good thing.  The service has always been great and the food is high quality.    On my recent visit our dessert was taking long -- which we didnt even notice -- without saying anything the server gave us the dessert and told us it was on the house.  Apologized about the delay and everything.  This is what customer service is about.  If this place was closer to where I lived I would go there once or twice a week.  As it stands I go in once a month.    My personal favorites are the Hawaiian Ribeye the French Dip and the Artichoke Dip.  One of my favorite restaurants and I always take people here when they come visit from out of town.',5
'First its easy to find parking something thats hard to say about most restaurants in Scottsdale.  You can park on the street (a little harder to find but very convenient) or park in the ample parking behind the restaurant.  If you like an island feel this place has it along with calming island music.  If you cant get to the islands youll still feel like youre there at Tommy Bahamas.  The food is fantastic and the service was some of the best Ive ever had.  I had the sea bass.  It was flaky moist and delicious.  My wife had the filet mignon which was equally delicious.  She had ordered medium well but it came out medium rare which the waitress quickly corrected.  After dinner you can stroll through some of the many stores in the Kierland Shopping Center.  Very relaxing.',4
'Tthis place is sex. Smash fries in and around my mouth. end rant youre welcome.',5
'I had a complete roof done by them and they were so expertly professional that I was completely satisfied. I am used to dealing with contractors and have been had by a few. This company was soooo up front clean and did an incredible job. They never tried to upsell me but when I asked about better attic ventillation they offered an esthetically pleasing yet effective solution at minimal additional cost. I cant say enough good about them! My roof looks fabulous!',5
'I bought a really nice Watch from Italy for a Christmas gift. But we could not figure out how to open and close the latch on the strap.  I wrote to the company and they suggested Precision Time in Chandler. So at first we had a hard time trying to find it. We had the address but  thought it would be a jewelery and watch store.   It turned out to be a Kiosk in the Chandler Mall. On the 2nd floor right accross from Gymboree.      The watch expert that helped us was Aaron. He was wonderful. He showed us how to use the band and lock on the watch. Which was wonderful. Then i got my watch a new battery. We were very happpy with our entire experiance. Quick and easy. Plus they seel a lot of really nice time pieces as well as watch repair batteries and cleanings. It is the place to go for all your watch needs.',5
'And to think I loved this place as a tourist. Whenever Id visit Phoenix Id eat at Encanto. Now that I live here you cant pay me to go. The food is average at best -- especially considering the prices -- and the duck pond is nothing short of disgusting.   Besides if you have kids (like I do) youre almost required to take them to feed the ducks which means youre walking through what the ducks (ahem) leave behind. Multiply that times 100 and imagine what the restaurants floor is covered in. Im just saying.',2
'Have been here multiple times and they are usually pretty nice. Came in to get my passport renewed and I didnt know I needed to make appointment. The lady let me know and then proceeded to roll her eyes very rude! So I came back in on my appointment day the lady asked me what I was here for and then made me wait while she got other customers. I have an appointment and there is someone else there to help customers and its not even busy! All in all its usps what do u expect its not going to get better.',1
'From the seaweed salad to the drinks and service. This place is a jem. Food was amazing and the drinks were generous. Toi mamy favorites to list. I cant wait to come back.',5
'This place is a little hard to find its way in the back of the Gilbert Towne Center.  I ended up here because I had a fandango gift card and only a couple movie theaters in the area allow online purchasing with it.  That gives them the fourth star ;)  I was early for my movie and you could clearly hear the movie playing in the theater right next to it I was concerned it would be distracting once my movie started but it was a non issue.  The seats are as comfy come with cupholders and from the inside looks like every other theater Ive been to recently.  The only drawback here is the last movie of the day is around 7pm.  At least thats true on the current schedule.    I came here for a matinee and it was almost empty - Ill follow the other reviewers notes and not come on a Fri/Sat night.',4
'the absolute best pancakes ive tasted anywhere in the world! Plus. Somehow they have perfected the art of making crisp bacon with no grease! Thei order of pancakes is enough for 2 people. And their fresh squeezed orange juice is the best. Plus...all I need to do is walk out the front door of my building when I get up and they are next door. So I image that makes everything tase better when Im feeling lazy in the morning!',5
'Great coffee quick service attractive if slightly sterile environment.  Needs to be busier.',4
'What a great place. Weve been here once before when visiting Scottsdale a couple of years ago and enjoyed it then too. Their outdoor patio is wonderful service is great. Oh yea and the food and drinks are outstanding. The guac is yummy (we dialed down spice because of young child but still very good); the slow cooked BBQ pork tacos were to die for and the cheese quesadilla was surprisingly yummy. LOVED my mojito and the specialty margaritas were good.   Two thumbs up will definitely visit again when in the area.',4
'Saw CAKE there last year.  Nice grass beautiful venue great night!',5
'Food and service were fantastic - red chili beef was exceptional.  We will definitely come back. Service was friendly and fast.  Casual friendly atmosphere. Things were a bit hectic at the front door with limited space for waiting. Otherwise a great experience.',4
'Cant go wrong with La Bocca!  The Garden Pizza is my absolute favorite. Their sangria is yummy whether its red or white!   The cucumber water is a little plus for me as well.',4
'Ive never really had a bad experience per se but Ive not exactly been helped a whole bunch either. Its Home Depot. What more can you expect?',3
'This is the very very best Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Nothing compares.   Everything I have tried there has been perfectly prepared fresh and delicious.   The Molcajetes are to die for. I had the Molcajete de Camaron and my husband had the A La mexicans and we thought they were both delicious. My mouth was watering for my husband A La Mexicana just on the presentation alone. Great place.',5
'Great people and even better food!',5
'The food is very good and the decor is nice.  Unfortunately the service doesnt follow.  Our waiter messed up our order multiple times.  The bartender knows absolutely nothing about wine - dont ask for his recommendations.  The hostess is totally clueless.  The kitchen is the key not the front of the house.   Looks like they need to totally rethink the staff outside of the kitchen.  Go and enjoy but dont be surprised to be frustrated.',4
'The food here is godawful. Everyone I know that has been here had said it was bad. I wanted to see for myself. I can confirm it is terrible. I have a feeling that the only reason theyre open is because they sell liquor',1
'Ive done Mongolian several times.  I like it.  Id heard about this place and the reviews here seem to be good so lets give it a try!  We were greeted very enthusiastically by a young man I assume (based on observations through the evening) was the manager.  They have two sizes of bowls.  The large is only $1 more.  And they have an option for unlimited refills for another dollar above that.  All prices include drinks and frozen yogurt (and rice and soup).  The actual ingredient table was nothing special.  Limited spices smaller selection of veggies.  A few sauces though they include recipes for mixing several more.  One of their people was very helpful at the sauce table mixing what we wanted.  Though they didnt have (or I didnt see) some standard sauces like szechuan.  And the names of the spices really didnt tell me much about them (except cumin of course...and lemon pepper).  So it was sort of a guessing game what I was getting.  They encourage you to pack your bowl and even have tissues to aid in doing so (and keep your hands clean).    The staff is friendly. The sauce was not very strong even though I chose spicy Hunan.  The flavor was really pretty mild.  And the noodles were either rice or wheat.  Really?  What about soba?  To compare and contrast Genghis Grill has a larger selection of spices sauces (though no recipes to mix variations) and seemed more flavorful.  But the quantity at YCs is definitely a LOT more.  Even packing the same amount their large bowl is much larger.  I will probably try them again to see if a different selection of spices and sauces will improve the flavor.  Next time Ill do rice noodles too.  I may update my rating when I try again.',3
'Ive lived in AZ for 26 years and never been here before. Wasnt outstanding but ok. Got the bittersweet chocolate sundae with one scoop of mint chocolate chip ice cream. Didnt taste bittersweet. Better places to go than this place. Like Sweet Republic.',3
'Ill admit that Im a little biased. Any business that is local and community based gets an immediate 1 star bonus. I love Tempe and I love the community we have here and this little farmers market is exactly the kind of business that we need more of. The new Tempe Farmers Market helps to fill the hole that The Gentle Strength Cooperative left behind. They built it inside that really neato gray brick building just across the tracks from Buffalo Exchange. I always thought that building had massive potential and Im glad somebody is putting it to good use.   There are a couple of negatives. First the prices are a little high. But you pay for what you get. I just got done eating the best BLT ever. I made it with a giant locally grown organic heirloom tomato locally grown bacon from that organic pork farmer in central Phoenix and locally baked organic bread. Second the selection is a limited. But thats to be expected from a farmers market. You dont go there to do all of your shopping. You go there and see what they have and then plan your meals around whats available. Part of the fun is going home and Googling recipes to decide what to do with that beautiful butternut squash you just bought. Thats how you become a better cook as well.   Shop local.',5
'Great burgers  service was ok. Would go back and bring friends/business associates.',4
'Id like to share a secret with you. Contrary to common belief Flemings is not just an option for a special night on the town! Believe it or not they offer things like happy hour prix fixe meals and specials all week long!  One of my favorite things is the happy hour. Every weekday they offer five for $5. That means they offer different appetizers for $5 the burger for $5 and several drinks for only $5. In addition they have a specialty cocktail every month that has only 99 calories!',4
'It just doesnt get better than this place in every way... service quality value taste etc.  And I cant over-emphasize VALUE!!!  This is just plain old CHEAP yet lacks nothing in quality.  Ive been to this place dozens of times and I would give it a 5 every time.  Get the lemonade.  Trust me!!  Its made in house and is such amazing.',5
'If not for its close proximity to US Airways and Chase Field stadiums this place would be worthless. Wings are skimpy and over-cooked to a tough stringy texture. Owner/manager/bartender certainly has no business being in the hospitality industry. Two of two times here he was a snippy jerk.',2
'Food and atmosphere is great! The owner is fun if you get to meet her. I love the fact that you can BYOB thus saving a ton of money on drinks.  I have had less expensive Pho though but the Pho here is great!',4
'After paying $10 for a footlong Tuna and a drink at Subway (read the review) I was obligated to find new lunchtime stomping grounds. And Ive found one.   How someone is going to take points for ambiance in a Chicago style gyro eatery is worth my lolz. But youre not going to a Chicgo style gyro eatery for ambiance. Youre going for good grub and a bottomless drink cup. This place rocks for what it is.   The decor is cool. I spent the vast majority of my meal staring at the posterboard sized photos of downtown Chicaga. I was lost and mezmerized at the fine details of the photos. I would bite and stare. Bite and stare.   And there was much to bite on. This pita came STUFFED with succulent tasty meat. Im not a tomato fan so I left those for those who are. My gyro was oozing sauce. I would take a bite and while enjoying the deliciousness that permeated my over-stuffed mouth contemplated what to do about the sauce on my fingers. KNOWING that if I dared to open my mouth Id be looking at the food I had just started to chew but understanding that if I did nothing with the sauce it would drip off of my fingers into the basket. Quite the dilemma I tell you. Bite and stare.... Ooooh! Look! Fries! Mmmmmmm....   I was there at 11:30 on a Thursday and it was less than crowded. Parking was no issue.   All of this for less than $7. Yep. Ill take my $3 and give it to the bum on the street. Better than spent at Subway.',4
'Saturday breakfast at 10 am and it only took 15 min to be seated I was impressed!  Husband got the Irish benny and looked pretty happy as he was wolfing it down.I went with the banana nut French toast and walked away on a crazy sugar high. Typical breakfast place loudfamily friendly.The fresh squeezed oj was a pleasant surprise.',4
'Came here instead of Starbucks to get some much needed study time... Its too hot for coffee.. Close to my university ... Has all things berry healthy... I personally ordered the Berry Fulfilling w a free energy shot... Free!! Ill take berries and free any day.. My drink : all berry and only 150 mere cals..& filling.. Actually felt like dessert.. Awesomely sweet staff..',5
'Im a big fan of lunch stops with good salads and sandwiches. Spicy Pickle is a welcome addition to this list. Ive yet to try the pizetti (though it looks good) but the salads and sandwiches Ive had have all been delicious. The spinach salad has apples walnuts and bleu cheese with an apple cider vinaigrette. Very tasty though there was a bit too much vinnaigrette at my last visit.  There are several sandwich selections to choose from but I think the best is to build your own from their list of ingredients.  There are deffinitely enough toppings to make a sandwich to your liking and I highly recommend choosing the sundried tomato mayo as your spread! Several cheeses to choose from as well with my favorite being the smoked mozerella.  As if that wasnt good enough I learned that Mondays are free cookie day! .Heaven. The chocolate chip cookie is soft - a little crunchy on the outside yet doughy in the middle. Perfect :)',4
'We went to Cibo for the first time with a group before the Lady Gaga concert.  It was my first time and I was very curious since I hadnt realized it until we went there that this had been suggested by another friend a few weeks earlier.  Cibo is just west of Central Ave and very close to ASU Downtown and the Light Rail.  Phoenix loves their Housetaurants Former houses turned restaurant. For this place it works.  Walking up the entire front yard is the patio seating.   Very cute setting lined with table umbrellas.  The lighting was enough to be comfortable in the setting and made it cozy.   It was charming.  If our friends had not been their before us I would have suggested we sit outside.  It was super cute.   We get in and we were seated in the back a little pocket in the back of a long room.  I guess it was becuase of the size of our group.   After looking over the menu most of us decided to go with individual pizzas.  I got the Margarita pizza.  When i got it it was delish!  It was pretty large for an individual so you might be taking some home.  We also got the Ostia Salad.  Wonderful flavors and the sharpness of the cheese shaved on it was a great start to the meal.  One thing that was slightly off was the service.  When we got there it was pretty empty and we were one of 2 tables in that section.  Our waitress while knowledgeable of the items always seemed like she was in a rush and really didnt give us the time.  My friend asked her a question and then when she took a second to make her decision she said Ok well Im going to have to come back to you and went on to taking the rest of our orders.  It was kind of the tone and the fact she seemed rushed.  She also didnt visit the table as much as she should in my oppinon especially since we were stuck in the back corner.  Then at the end of the meal we saw why.  18% auto gratuity.  It never fails big group poor service.  It wasnt bad enough to not go back and like I said she was knowledgeable of the menu but her overall attitude seemed like we were an inconvenience to her. Maybe she was missing the concert because she had to work? :)   Oh well no big deal we would definitely go back!',4
'We went here because we were looking for another restaurant and couldnt find it. The parking was a little weird. We accidentally got on the highway trying get into the parking lot.  To start the hostess a flat out cunt. I honestly think calling her a bitch would be giving her credit.  The server didnt arrive at the table for close to five minutes. The complimentary chips and salsa/dip didnt arrive until after he took our order for nachos. He recommended we try the new New Mexico Red Chili sauce on our food with chopped chilies if we like spicy food. We took the bait. Ill admit the niceness of the server almost redeemed the cunt hostess.  The food was bland however spicy and not bad but not good either. We drove way out of way to find a restaurant we couldnt find and ended up here instead. Needless to say we wont be returning. The cunt at the front door and the food left a bad taste in my mouth. The server is the only reason I give Arriba a second star.',2
'I made my first trip to Bandera a week ago or so. Actually I forgot Id been there until I saw Gabis review. I wasnt particularly hungry when we stopped in for a late dinner before Nathans surprise party so my meal consisted of a few sides. We started with the obligatory cornbread skillet which everyone raves about...I wasnt crazy about it. I love the idea: cheese cornbread and green chiles but it was WAAAAY sweet for me. I definitely expected something more savory and cheesy but the sweet corn over-powered everything else.   My meal was the side house salad and a side of mac and cheese. I make really awesome m&c so I wasnt uber impressed with banderas version but it was good nonetheless. The nice little house salad was indulgent my favorite part by far. Well-dressed ribboned lettuces and cabbages with I think 1/12th of an avocado and a tablespoon of goat cheese and a few other bits and pieces tossed in.   Our server was pleasant service in general was quick and we were seated right away too which was surprising on a Saturday night around 9pm. I would go back if someone suggested it.',3
'Hold my purse its about to get real!!  I went to Phoenix with my suitcase 3/4 full and I went back with to Cali with it overflowing with clothes. Last Chance may have been the reason why there is also a small crack in my hardshell suitcase now... even so I would do it again!!  The haul: - Black Leather Seychelle wedges for $20 (that I were to death at work to this day!) - Black Leather Steve Madden heels for $2 - Dark Grey Calvin Klein Blazer for $20 - Black Colosseum MCMXCII jacket for $20 (also another staple) - Floral lacey tank top for $8 (adorable! and matches the jacket)  This place is a like a bargain shoppers paradise. If you have the time and the patience to hunt for clothes (&I love rummaging through sale sections) you will find treasures here. One of my co-workers bought a fitted Cole Haan leather jacket for $60. The place is pretty organized (similar to a Marshalls) although its not as clean as a Nordstorm Rack. They do have a pretty great selection of almost everything though.    I would definitely caution you to inspect your clothes carefully - some of these clothes have definitely been through a lot of wear and tear (from shipping or people trying them on).  I went during work hours on a week day so it wasnt super crowded - I have heard that it can be crowded on the weekends.',5
'We came in with a very large party 40+ people and our server Paige and the manager rocked!  They were so friendly and patient with our chaos we would highly recommend them.  Food was yummy too.',5
'Where do I start? Ive been to this Old Chicago once before but I dont remember my visit being so horrible. I wish I could say that it was an isolated event that tarnished my outlook but unfortunately this whole trip sucked.   I arrive and had to go to the bathroom but we had to be somewhere after lunch so I decided to wait to get my drinks and food ordered before I use the facilities. I get seated with my party and we wait a few minutes and the waitress comes along and orders all of our drinks. We browse the menu and wait...and wait...and finally our drinks come and she leaves again...so I still have go to the bathroom but I wanted to order first (I figured shed be right back) but we wait...and wait...then she comes back and finally takes our order. I run to the bathroom and - ew gross! I try to hold my breath and start to breath through my nose (I heard that your nose was a natural filter) the whole place was grimmy and sticky and trashy - I get back to my seat and enjoy my group of friends while we wait for our food. Funny thing is...we kept waiting...and waiting...almost 30 minutes go by and out come our salads.   Then 20 minutes go by again and out come our entrees well except mine. I sit back thinking that when the waitress left she left to get the rest of our food...but a minute goes by and I ask some other chick (thank goodness we were next to the kitchen door) if they were gonna bring me my food and my waitress over heard me and she popped out of nowhere and was like oh and what did you order?...really? I told her and she comes back in 2 seconds with my food.   I had the buffalo chicken hoagie the toasted hoagie was dry and stale the chicken was dry and beside the buffalo sauce it really had no wow affect I was actually very disappointed. The house salad I got was really good though. I liked the roasted almonds - they were semisweet and really added something special to an otherwise boring typical salad.   Side note: a friend of mine also had to use the bathrooms and the stall she chose didnt have any seat covers and she said the seat was sticky...sick-o-dear.  Really OC?? Do you only clean your place bimonthly or something? It was so bad if this is how you care for your restrooms Id hate to see the kitchen!!   I would give this place 1 start but our waitress (although slower than molasses in the winter) was really nice and other people in my group enjoyed their food (namely their pizza).',2
'Im sorry am I in Portland OR? Nope still in Phoenix -- but this outside-the-box house-turned-shop is very Portlandia and oh-so-fun! I visited this establishment on a Thursday night to attend a slam poetry reading held outside and was instantly enthralled. The street that the shop is on is lined with similar homes that double as businesses and you can hear music laughter and general fun being had by all as you stroll from place to place. The bookstore itself has all the requirements of a great secondhand bookstore -- places outside to sit old creaky wood floors rooms and rooms of floor-to-ceiling-books and great low prices. I didnt get to peruse the books for too long because I was drawn outside to hear some poetry being slammed -- but Id definitely return for the books.',4
'Un@$%!ing believable cheesesteak!   I just want to admit something and Im not ashamed about it. I went to DeFalcos two days in a row for that sammich. Seriously its that good. From the bread to the perfect amount of cheese its definitely the best cheesesteak sandwich Ive had in the 5+ years that Ive been here in the valley. The only thing that upsets me about it is that now Ill have a hard time trying some of the other items on the menu.  From the reviews I have read a lot of people have long waits when eating here but I did not. I think if you can work around peak restaurant hours you shouldnt have much of a problem. Also the staff was pretty nice to my group and me.   Im addicted. There I said it. DeFalcos brings the East to the Southwest and it does pretty perfectly. Its a must if youve moved from back East and want a little taste of home or if youve never been out that way and you want a little taste of what youre missing.  Bravo!',5
'The food they serve is made to order so it takes a little longer than most fast food burger joints.  Not to worry..  Its well worth the wait.  Ive eaten here a handful of times.  They are pretty consistent with their service and their food.    This weekend I ordered via the drive-thru window and when I got home my fries were still crunchy.  Thats always a plus for me.',4
'First I want to say I love you Bob... I really do.  While hosting a party at the art gallery I got a bit handsy/button pushingsy (no those are not real words but they explain the situation) with my blackberry. I am not technology driven. I wasnt even alcohol driven I have no excuse whatsoever. However I somehow managed to erase seven months of my childs life in one fell swoop or button push. I immediately wanted to fall into the fetal position and cry a river of tears (or at least a small pool or jacuzzi.) I the non-stop talker was speechless. As all the color drained from my face my friend asked what was wrong and luckily she had her fourteen year old son with her (technology wizards) and he was able to convince me to live until I could get to the Verizon store to have them try to retrieve my photos. This all happened on a Friday night. I was so terrified that they would fail that it took me until Monday to work up the courage to go to the store. I had worked up an ulcer the size of a quarter and when I went to the store on Camelback and 16th Street at first I was thinking... well I cant write what I was thinking but the store had moved.  The store was located between a mattress store and Baja Fresh. It was small cramped and always seemed stressful. I am happy to say it just jumped over to where a video store was located and is in the same general vicinity. Luckily my five year old was wearing her glasses and wanted juice so we spotted it. The new store now next to Jamba Juice has a new vibe. It is larger spacious and seems more friendly and relaxed. I was seen with very little delay.   This is where the hero of the story comes in. Bob Bob Bob the name rolls off my tongue like a... well I cant quite think of something that rolls off my tongue but Bob was the man who worked and worked on my phone and got all my pictures back. He saved my life okay not my life but the photos of my sweet girl and for that I am very grateful. So if you are in that area and have a Verizon phone you need to deal with this is the store I would recommend. And be sure to tell Bob hello.',5
'Love their pizza!!! Very fresh. Their cannoli was really good too. They seem to have great selection of wines.',5
'Great service great meal.  Medalions cooked to perfection very good margaritas the Flan was worth writing home about.  It could  be called Crema Catalan.  Excellent.',5

'So back to Pita Kitchen I went this past Saturday.  This time with my mom step-dad and Baby C!  We ordered and sat down at a table.    I got the same thing as my visit on the 20th - Gyro pita and greek salad.   This time the Gyro was NOT greasy.  Very tasty at that.  The Greek salad again was awesome.    My mom ordered the same thing as I and thought the food was good.  And my step-dad ordered the chicken souvlaki.  It came with rice and salad.  He liked it so much he almost cleaned his plate!  Seriously good food here!  So good that Baby C enjoyed some Gyro and chicken!  :)',4
'Thank you Dr. Lindsey! I will be a bride in about a week and was horrified to wake up to a ruptured blood vessel in my eye.  Concerned for my eyes as a diabetic and unsure if I was really ok (and if my pictures were going to turn out ok or not) I was able to get a quick appointment and after being examined was assured I was going to be just fine and that I was already in the healing stage.   I am so relieved and so grateful to be seen so quickly.   Thank you Valley Eye Care for taking some of the stress out of this crazy week!  Its amazing how much more relaxed I am after being examined - I just had to say Thanks!',5
'I love that their menu is Italian with a southwestern flair - its unique! I love their cream sauce that includes chipotles. Portions are big!! The baked-to-order cookie a- la-mode is worth saving room for! Their pizza is alright (I prefer Venezias) and I wasnt impressed with wings.  Theres often a wait which is a testament in this economy to the quality of their shop. Finally I like that their t-shirt slogans are usually a little cheeky.',4
'I went back and tried the coffee shop - wonderful! Excellent quality prices and service :)',5
'Love this place. Been coming here for almost two years now satudays when the market is in session for breakfast.   wow how do i tell you this. I literally feel beter about life afer eating here and shopping the fresh veggies and meats...lots of knowledge and organic foods lots of healthy stuff. Really nice place for a weekend walk bike whatevs  Totally recommend  Have fun',5
'I heard about this restaurant from the radio station 103.9. I was listening to Montis morning show and she began talking about how great the food was at BLD. We decided to visit for lunch. The menu was interesting and had a lot of choices that were different. Not the same old same old. I asked how long BLD had been opened and was very surprised when he said two years. I had never once heard of this place until now.  We ordered the Dr Pepper BBQ pork sandwiches. He got onion rings I got sweet potato fries. All of it was delicious.  The only reason we may not choose to visit this place is that while the waiter was helpful and he eventually warmed up...it appeared to be an effort.  The manager or whom we believed to be the manager never even said boo to us. He must have walked by us four times and tried hard not to make eye contact. We were there at a non busy time of day not the height of lunch hour. He wandered around the restaurant visited their wine cellar. We just felt like in other restaurants where management cares about their customers he would at least stop by once and ask how we enjoyed our meal.  He didnt stop at any of tables so everyone was neglected. Once again Ill say that he was not too busy.  I read the other reviews after our visit and it appears that many others feel about the same way as far as the service/servers/management treatment of customers. There are many restaurant choices for my family to choose from and we like to go where we feel welcome...not just another person to hand food to and pay the bill. Im  not sure that we will go back even though we saw some items on the breakfast menu that we thought were unique.',3
'One of our favorite places!!!  Love the cozy atmosphere & how they replicated the old place to a T!  We love to take friends there because we know with out a doubt they will Love it!  There is something for everybody seafood to mexican to pizza(which is wonderful)  they have a wonderful happy hour if you are lucky enough to get a seat around the bar :)  And dont miss the chance to have the roasted garlic platter it is to die for!  (just make sure everyone with you eats it too ;)  Easy to make a reservation on yelp so what are you waiting for?  Go NOW!',5
'I cant believe I havent been here before! What a cool place as everyone else has said you basically cross off what you dont like and they make everyone at the table a different meal for each course. It was an excellent meal and everyone had a great time! I would probably give it a 5 star rating but I really didnt like the kangaroo I had for my main course.  Ive had other gamey meat like ostrich bison etc.. but it was never tough this was really tough meat. Started with the Cucumber Mint Refresher which was excellent!',4
'I really want to love this place more because they source so many local ingredients including grass fed beef for hamburgers. The staff is mostly wonderful especially the sous chef turned executive chef. Hes so sweet.   The reason I hesitate to give this place more stars is because I recently learned they make their salad dressing from a mixture of olive oil and canola oil. Sorry but canola oil is not OK or healthful. I was told a long time ago that they used olive oil only so either that wasnt true or theyve changed the recipe. Sadly. The other reason I cant go higher than 3 stars is that darn near every time Im there for the burger the thing isnt cooked right. The people working the grill need some lessons. When I order medium rare it comes out rare. When I order it medium it comes out tough and well done.   I think the prices are decent and the decor nice. I really enjoy the place but have gone there so much less over the months due to the above complaints. I wasnt going to write a review because I just dont like leaving reviews unless theyre great but Im hoping that someone there is reading these and taking the reviews into consideration. There are so few places with grass fed meat options which endears me to MIM but if it cant be cooked properly I lose the desire to go.',3
'I cant say enough good things about this company.  Mike returns phone calls shows up on time is knowledgeable and professional.  He goes the extra mile to ensure you are more than pleased.  I will be calling this company again and recommending him to my friends.  So very impressed!!!!!!',5
'This is a great way to enjoy a game its regular Fridays food and 50% of the face value of each table is credited to the food and beverage total. The table is available about 30 minutes before the game.',4
'This is the most. wonderful church Ive ever been to! The masses are beautiful and the people are friendly and welcoming!  I cant imagine going anywhere else.',5
'Grazie and I met over the weekend for the first time. Its located in Verado a uniquely planned community 35 minutes west of Phoenix. My author friend Paul Daffinrud and I met here to update our friendship & review his new book: The Janitor Solved the Murder. Their fresh Mozzarella & Tomato salad combined with the Manicotti was superb the canoli for dessert was freshly made my Amber Ale was COLD smooth and added the right touch. Ill be back...',4
'Fresh food! Great service! Lively atmosphere!  Would def recommend :) My husband and I come here on most o our date nights before we go anywhere else. We bring our kids here too. It is kid friendly. This place got our kids loving sushi. I recommend it to all my friends. PS. Dessert is yummy too!',5
'My boyfriend and I went here on a Wednesday night for dinner and were pleasantly surprised to find that all the positive yelp reviews were true! We ordered the wagyu beef dumplings crispy fried squid spicy tuna roll lamb cutlets and ginger sesame broccolini along with wine. We enjoyed our entire meal and had great service. One downside was how loud it was inside the restaurant even though it wasnt overly crowded. Overall the food was worth it and we will definitely be back!',4
'A nice patio location but a rather limited selection of wines by the glass for a wine bar.  It also seems odd to me whenever a wine bar doesnt keep their red wines in a wine cooler as just about all of the reds that weve tried here would have greatly benefited from such a practice.  On a positive note Rhythm & Wine is one of the few wine bars to offer a Gruner Veltliner by the bottle (if youve never tried this varietal its a great summer white) however they do not keep any chilled on hand so it will be a bit of a wait once you order as they will need to chill the bottle.    Weve had a few of their pizzas which have good flavor but are a bit oily and heaped with cheese for our liking and the hummus is also good.  When sitting at the bar the service is generally fairly prompt but the times that weve sat at the patio and been at the mercy of the owners daughters to wait on us the service has been slow to say the least.  In fact one time the owner himself actually seated us and then stood around as we waited at least 15 minutes for one of his daughters to make it over to our table so that we could order our wine (which then needed to be chilled as there was none already in the cooler). While you can certainly find better wine bars in general Rhythm & Wine is a decent place to stop in at if youre in the neighborhood.',3
'A dive bar without shuffleboard doesnt deserve 5 stars.  But the bikini is good times as long as its not too crowded and doesnt have a DJ. I dont understand the people here who like a DJ at a dive seems so wrong to me.  They also have serious problems keeping their mixers carbonated. Ive been served more flat G&Ts here then at every other bar Ive ever been to combined. So I stick to the PBR.  But Ive got a lot of good memories from this place. Mostly when they stay open past legal hours. No better way to prepare yourself for family time at a Thanksgiving feast then to get completely trashed until 3am at a dive the night before.',4
'Top of the meh list for business travelers. There are about 1 electrical port for every 100 people so plan according. Phoenix is a great town and this place moves a lot of people.',3
'I have only been here once but will definitely be back! We were seated right away the waitress greeted us promptly and we were in a nice table for the two of use (not one of those two-seaters crammed up against the wall).   The food is amazing! Im pregnant so didnt get to enjoy any drinks but my husband had a glass of wine from their more unique wine menu. Weve noticed most restaurants tend to carry the same things but not here it was pleasantly different!  I had the blackened redfish - delicious cooked perfect and the accompanyments were delish. My husband had the bacon-wrapped pork - I didnt try it but he loved it. It came with grits (hes from the south and orders then any chance he gets) and he said they were REALLY good.  We will be back for sure!',5
'Chick I wanted to love you so. I order oven roasted and rotisserie chickens all the time from restaurants that do them really well. Chicks not quite there yet. Its also brand new so I have high hopes.  For one things are a bit expensive. They at least have quarter chicken portions and the sides are accommodating: You get a big ol artichoke for your side which was decent and a bunch of whipped potatoes. The potatoes are a bit soupy mostly by virtue of swimming in butter; when they first came out I had them with sour cream chives and cheese and they were just too salty. The chef came out and we mentioned that and he brought back a huge bowl of the regular whipped potatoes that were really quite tasty.   Our friends had the roasted vegetables which were carrots and parsnips. Not much to write home about right? Wrong. They were actually fantastic crispy and bright and with a bit of something that made them really pop. If more of the sides hit like that wed be closer to home run territory.   My girlfriend got the pot pie. It was actually really tasty the crust was fantastic and it had that hearty kinda inside to it. Couldve used a dash of salt (perhaps stolen from my potatoes) but other than that it was really good.  The service was slow and the server misheard our friend ordering a half glass even though she repeated it twice and brought out a full glass (and charged for it). Even still he got basically everything else right and was able to split the check just fine. We did have about a 35-40 minute wait from ordering entrees to seeing the food and they were a bit busy but thats a bit much in general. The biscuit appetizers came out right quick.   The wine concept is really cool. They use those purging machines that allow them to pour any quantity they want without affecting the other wine: it fills the bottle with an inert gas so that they can do that with literally any bottle and they have a large selection available. Im not a wine drinker but my other guests liked the idea.  The chicken just lacked pizzazz for me. For a place thats built around that entirely I think they need to amp it up a bit. Even from a chain like Charlestons they know how to season and roast a mean chicken. Here there wasnt much of any flavor on the outside and while I didnt have that dryness others have complained about it just didnt reach out and grab me. Especially for a $9 quarter chicken organic or not. Id like to see more flavor there. It was okay but it wasnt magical.  The sauces are pretty neat and the honey truffle sauce was pretty tasty but I dont know if I should have to rely on sauce to jazz up something like roasted chicken. They definitely add something though and the variety is unique. (I tried the creamy garlic as well.)  Ill say this: the chef came out to talk to us and after replacing the potatoes he was really nice and brought out some of his cheese biscuits as well which were pretty tasty. He was incredibly friendly and you can tell hes working really hard on building this out.   For that Ill give it a few more months and give them another shot to see if they get their sea (or chicken) legs underneath them.',2
'This review is more about the service than the Food. I had the food here once before and it was fantastic. So when my friend came in from Denver I said yes lets meet here the food is great! Well the food was great! Awesome for me. I got the Brussels sprout saladwhich has a touch of bacon. $14.00 Very good but very high priced even for the Airport. My friend got a burger that came with fries. For $13.00 that was a bit high I thought. The bun completely fell apart & we dont know why. However the food is very good so that is not the issue. The issue was our server. She was the absolute worst!!  Everyone else is happy in here taking good care of their customers and really working hard. We had to get the one that did not want to be there that did not have any idea what was going on in the restaurant at all. Our server was Imelda She may of been having a really bad day or just completely uncaring about her job.  We waited about 20 min for our food. Which of course this is a sit down place so I am not complaining about that at all. However In over an hour in the place we were never offered a refill on our tea. I had hot  she had Iced. Our food was brought out to us she never asked  do you need anything else how is everything something more a refill dessert...Nothing. when she did a drive by to throw the check on the table I was able to ask for a Take Away container for my friend. Which she did bring to us. But really it was a horrible experience with Imelda. I would watch her walk around not really doing anything just stroking her hair. I wondered why she did not check on us. It was 2:30 in the afternoon she was not even busy.  The place is decorated very nicely. With a nice faux fireplace which I think is really nice and relaxing. I really wanted to have a nice time here I told my friend from Denver that she was going to love the food here. Maybe we will try it again. But I will be sure to get a different server. The hostesses were sweet and friendly.',3
'This is what they think of African Americans a friend forwarded this message to me from the owner David! I cant copy and paste message but he think black people are not educated and all are thieves and need to be put in there place from time to time by Armenian people. i can forward message if you really want to see it.',1
'Great beers on tap - Four Peaks and Oak Creek among them.  8th St. Ale - I heart you.  The place was playing mid-90s Radiohead and Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.  That in itself is pure genius.   Liked the beer barrels showcased through a window.  The outdoor deck looks like it will be a real hit when it gets a bit warmer.   Nice cozy feel warm avocado walls and kick-ass vintage chandeliers that I want to go back and snag!  The highlight of the decor though is the oddly curious Being John Malkovich doorway up above on your way to the restroom.   My Chicago buddy with me was unimpressed - but Im sure places like this are a dime a dozen there.  This place rocks.  Its the downtown bar weve all been waiting for.  EDIT 9/07 - Dave B is right on about the same music being played every night.  I always hear the same exact songs by Radiohead and Coldplay every time I go to Roosevelt.  WEAK!!!',4
'Not a bad place.... It is defiantly more tex-mex than authentic... but they have Mexican beer margaritas and is in a good location.',3
'The cookies are still wonderful but they changed the bbq chicken chopped salad and I dont like it.  Instead of fresh tasting corn they now have a sort of southwest corn mixture with onion and bell pepper.  I really dont like it at all.  Also the chicken isnt really chopped... its cut in strips.  I wish they would go back to the old way of',3
'I LOVE True Foods Kitchen! The staff is always so friendly and helpful!! Brandon and Megan Helped me yesterday and our whole table loved them.    I personally love the shaved turkey with sweet potato hash on the side but everything Ive had there is exceptional!!',5
'I was hungry for Gyro. I checked Yelp and saw a place I had not heard of before.  It is a nice market and restaurant.  I wanted to sample a couple of menu items of my typical Mediterranean cravings.  Gyro - Lamb and beef and grilled. Decent portion too. Hummus was very good. Grape leaves are really good. The filling is seasoned well like they should be. Not the tasteless wrapped in a grape leaf. I could make a meal of these alone. I am glad I found them.',4
'Freshly made bagels with different sandwich options for breakfast and lunch.  They have a decent selection and generally the sandwiches are made pretty quickly for you.  Not really the best bagel Ive ever had but its in no way the worst and its in a very convenient location close to Sunflower Market if you want a quick bite for breakfast before shopping for groceries.',3
'Yummy fast fairly priced and great service! Ill be back!!',4
'I didnt make this reservation wasnt expecting a luxury hotel but definitely expected a lot more. Room was not ready upon arrival. After checking in and going to the room-someone was in the room! They gave me a key to someones room!! Room number two wasnt made up or cleaned. Keys were disabled multiple times though they were kept separate from electronic devices or other cards. There were cigarette burns throughout the room. What an awful place. Avoid at all costs.',1
'O.... M..... G....  This place is so awesome I cant even get valley girl enough!  Had this place not been on Triple D I would have never stepped foot in this place.  But this is NOT like those fast food joints that sell donuts chinese food and fried chicken.  Not even close.  This place is so good!!!!  Its not healthy- but who cares!  I love getting the teriyaki chicken in a quesadilla (teriyaki sauce on the side) and the jade chicken is good in ANYTHING!  Throw in some chicken fried rice and some refried beans and you have the makings for awesomeness.  My husband made a comment that this is the food that Im going to crave when Im pregnant.  Well Im not pregnant but I am craving it ALL THE TIME!!!  I cant sing its praises enough!  Be prepared though the secret is out and the place gets busy.  You will not be sorry though :)  I LOVE YOU CHINO!',5
'On a strip of bars catering to a college-age crowd this modern American beer garden with a large patio that is friendly to both dog and bike offers a fantastic selection of draft beers ranging from Austrian to Belgian to Arizonan.  This is also one of the only places in the valley that I have discovered that offers beer cocktails.  Try the signature HANDLEBAR SHANDY with Stiegl Goldbrau lager San Pellegrino Limonata Agave Nectar and a sprig of Rosemary to top it off.  For $6 this is an outstanding value.    The space itself is open and inviting combining rustic wooden table and bartops exposed brick on walls and ceilings and a lot of natural light coming in from the centerpiece of the room - the bar - which is 60 feet long and has both indoor and outdoor seating.    The food here is made to order in the cozy little grilling area situated in the corner of the bar.  Keep this in mind when coming here on a busy night - you might wait a while for your food.  But luckily the menu is simple and consists of local gourmet bratwurst polish sausage italian and a smoked turkey sausage.  For $5 you can select up two toppings such as sauerkraut or pickled fresno peppers.  For sides you have the option of regular or sweet potato hand cut fries and for $3 with a dipping sauce of your choice they are unbeatable.  Highly recommend the decadent bleu cheese bacon dip!  It also tastes amazing on the burger as well as the brat.  The kitchen is open late night for food which beats getting a pizza or taco on Mill after a night of carousing.  Weekly events are Scrabble nights on Mondays Ladies night on Tuesdays Trivia night on Wednesdays  Great neighborhood bar great place to stop in for lunch or a late night bite great place for beers!',4
'What is the hype people????I went here for lunch after seeing all the awesome  reviews but I was disappointed. First the menu is very hard to understand (see the pic that someone posted). I ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and hummus platter. There isnt much of a drink selection in the tiny fridge. For soda all they had was the cans and they charged $1.00 for them. Later while I was eating I noticed a lot of people were buying their drinks from the market then coming over to order their food (pain in the ass if you ask me). Anyhow so I was only 1 of a few people there and the food took quite a while. When they finally called my order I went up and asked for the garlic sauce that I heard so much about on here and the lady said it would cost $1.00. I said nevermind because I wasnt going to pay that for a small container of condiment! I was surprised at how small the sandwich was. It wasnt  impressive either. Just a grilled flatbread with a few pieces of  chicken a few tomato slices lettuce and a little sauce. In my opinion this wasnt worth 3.99 but more worth 2.50 or something because of its size and how little filling there was.The hummus was good but  nothing spectacular. This place is also in a dodgy part of town right across from project housing...literally right across the street. The market was pretty cool though and Ill prob return (during the daylight of course) for some olives olive oil and pita. BUT will skip out on dining here.',1
'I was a fan of the Dirty Drummer over in Tempe back during college years at ASU. So when I walked in this location I was happy to see the faithful ASU Banner up near the bar!   The waitress was really friendly she greeted me promptly and asked what she could get me as if I was a regular. I asked if they still did hot wings and she said why of course 12 for $5. So I ordered them and a cold draft and set back to watch the NFL game in progress.   The game didnt go my way but the wings came out just perfect as they always have! Hot & crispy with just enough sauce to give them a little bite and not loose the crispiness of the big juicy wings.   The beer was cold and the shoot of Tequila I had was ample to say the least. Only they dont stock my friend Jose ...Whats up with that so I had some off brand I never heard of call Tres Amigos. It was chilled to the right temperature and slid down easy.   Cant wait to visit on a Tuesday for that burger special now.  See ya there?',4
'great food and beer service  probley the some of the best fish and chips iv had any where. 5 nice pieces of fish and a pile of chips 10 bucks',5
'Dont mind the crabby waitress! The buffet is CHEAPER alternative than going to Panda Express (maybe even a bit tastier?). I realize Panda Express is not the best example of Chinese food but if you are looking for an inexpensive Americanized Chinese food there is no better.   I cant speak for the traditional Chinese food menu but I recommend that you do not come here for GOURMET Chinese food.   Also I wish they would clean their fish tank. It was ok until I noticed them taking out a fish and taking it to the kitchen. Then again there is no fish in the buffet ;)',4
'QUICK convenient cafe in the Phoenix airport when youve got few options to begin with!!  i like this cafe because i was looking for a salad and normally airport salads are expensive & limp BUT they had a nice bacon spinach salad w/ strawberries here which was pretty cheap (its extra if you add chicken)  workers were SUPER nice  NOTE: you can order at the register for a fresh salad OR if youre in a rush they have pre-made ones in the fridge that you can grab & go',4
'The best quick teriyaki bowls that Ive had in the area. I always order ahead so I dont have t',5
'I dont usually write reviews for chains but this Dominos was bad even for fast food pizza standards. Way too greasy and it was definitely stale old grease. Ended up throwing half the pizza out because it just tasted so bad. Cheese only was edible but anything we had with toppings was bad. Not coming back.',2
'This was the first time I had been to Ruths Chris Steakhouse the food lived up to the expectations Id heard from others.  The portions were good and the items came at the right time.  I did not feel rushed in any way and our waiter Jimmy did an excellent job answering every question we had.  I tried their special house dressing Rimaloud(dont know how to spell it) which was a kind of spicy creamy dressing which I highly recommend.  My steak was cooked exactly to order and melted in my mouth one of the best filets Ive ever had.    The restaurant was very nice the type of place that youd visit on special occasions worth the entire experience.',5
'What happened Z? I let a few meh experiences go trying to not be too critical but this last time really irritated me. One of our favorite pies here is a slight tweak on the Thai chicken we drop the dead bird and the dairy and add Daiya cheese and avocado along with all the other toppings that come with it. They dont give you any money back for dropping chicken but thats cool I can deal with that but at the very LEAST get all the other toppings on there.   We order online to avoid any confusion plus I think its handy to have online ordering. Usually if something has onions it only goes on half the web ordering makes this very easy to do. This last time was no different except we go maybe 1/4 of an avocado over then entire pie; it was a disgrace. Additionally they totally left of ALL of the bean sprouts carrots and chiles! WTF!? It was bare. $18 for this? Really? I probably should have called back at that point but I had one incident a few months back and didnt want to hassle with it. We give this place lots of business though and I feel completely duped.  For the time being we have been making pizza at home and LOADING on the toppings I will admit that its not as good and more of a pita but I am not ready to give Z another chance just yet I feel too betrayed.',3
'Great food and great service. I have been several times to other locations and this one is as good as the rest. Very clean and a good value.',5
'After an impromptu happy hour organized by none other than Georgie S I feel I need to write a review. There were fellow Yelpers and non-Yelpers alike. Everyone had a grand time. How can you not when there are $1/$2 tacos $4 nachos and $2 Dos Lager on draft?!   I had the Mahi Mahi tacos on corn tortillas which were $2. Plus 6ish Dos Equis. All for $35 including tip. Not too bad I thought. Our server was a little on the slow side but we were having a good time and didnt mind too much. I tried the nachos and they were decent and for $4 nicely sized. We were sitting on the patio on a great early evening/night. Normally Tuesday nights are reserved for hockey but being in between seasons a little HH was just what the doctor ordered. This night turned into an adventure with a drunken trip to the Grapevine. Solid!',4
'Amazing greek food! Definitely try the greek fries!  I always try to come here every time I am in Phoenix.  Staff is also always very friendly!  Also try the greek calamari.  Unusually delicious!',5
'What can I say its Chipotle.  Fast food but done really well.  Their burritos are large and their prices reasonable.  You tell them what you want in it and they make it right in front of you.  Im not normally a fast-food fan (in fact I hate it).  But this is the exception to the rule.  Dont expect authentic Mexican food here.  Its not.  Its Mex-American burritos.  But if youre hungry want something fast and inexpensive and cant stand the usual greasy fast-food crap Chipotle is a good alternative.  For what they are they are very good.  If youre wondering how they compare to Qdoba frankly I find them interchangeable.  They both do the same thing and they both do it well.',4
'I love this place the staff are great as is the food ......the coffee though welllll  a coffee house that uses a broken espresso machine that burns the beans now thats not good. should have spent some money on the espresso machine  instead of that great big new awning   but hey the reg. coffee is still top notch',4
'Im a New Yorker and this is the best Middle Eastern restaurant Ive eaten at. I came with my husband son and in-laws. The decor of the restaurant isnt great but I appreciate that since I did not want to be in a fancy restaurant with a crying toddler. The restaurant is attached to the grocery store so if I wanted to attempt making this delicious food I couldve bought the ingredients. Amazing food- hummus tabouli grilled meats all very tasty. And they receive a 5 star because for the first time my mother-in-law did not send her dish back.',5
'Really nice little place with some really nice sushi and really nice people. The prices were really nice too!!! Unfortunately the constant smell of backed up sewage isnt really nice. Fix that and it could stay in my back pocket for emergency sushi when the craving strikes.',3
'Im really surprised that the other reviewers had such a bad time in this store.     My last carrier was Alltel and Verizon gobbled them up this year.  Being a cell phone owner since the days when they came in a bag like a heavy small carry-on bag I have to say I HAVE NEVER HAD A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE IN A CELL PHONE STORE BEFORE.   EVAH.   Ive had a Treo for many years.  Last year I dropped the phone and broke the screen.   Went into the Alltel store and they literally said to me sorry youre screwed; we dont replace screens; you have no insurance; youre still under contract - so my only solution was to buy a new one for $600 according to the very harried and unpleasant rotund pimply fellow at the Alltel store.   Methinks there must be another way!  So I got on line and found this PDAparts.com for replacement screens.   They warn you: this voids any warranty!!!   But it was only $70 so I went for it.  They actually have a step-by-step video posted on YouTube on how to replace the screen.  Scary but my trusty friend/co-worker Chris is an engineer so he did the dirty work for me in about 5 minutes flat.  YAY.    Phone worked perfectly until.... one day... the screen just went blank.  So Im hosed now right?  And its December.   The phone technically still WORKED as in: it rings and I can fumble to answer it... but I cant see whos calling or who is texting me or make calls... or read my emails... so it was kinda limiting.  So with much trepidation I wandered myself over to the Verizon store on Camelback figuring I was now only 1 month away from the end of my contract and maybe I just had to bite the bullet and switch to a new phone.    They dont make the Treo 755p anymore and I really didnt want to learn how to use a whole new phone... too busy.  But I guess I gotta.   So you walk in and they ask you:  do you need service or sales and whats your name?    Service... Jane.     They put you on a list which is on a big monitor and tell you: you are 4th in line for service.   Sigh... look around... and not 5 minutes later Im called up.   The very friendly and CUTE guy who helped me took a look and agreed the screen is fried.    Do you want to pick out a new phone today or can you wait a few days to get a refurbished 755p?    Huh?  I could get another 755p?    Yes we will replace your phone but we dont have them HERE so youd have to wait a few days.   Um... okay... I guess I can wait but how much will that cost?   Oh itll be free.    FREE?    Sold!   The people working there were joking around with each other easy going and super helpful.  There were other people in the store who were clearly stressed and in a bad mood and from what I observed these folks were super-great at defusing them.   Something good is going on at that shop and based on my experience (a) I highly recommend them; and (b) Im sticking with Verizon!',5
'I must say it is a great place to go when your craving some good authentic Soul Food and waffles..... The atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing.... Their is always help walking around ready to serve you and answer any questions you have....   I had the 3 piece fried chicken with a side of collard greens and mac and cheese it also came with a buttery corn muffin.... The food was hot fast tasty and fresh....   I love the gospel sunday.... It makes me feel at home.... And the fact that you can order kool aid makes this place feel even more like home.....   Whether you have room for desert or not you have to order it...  The banana pudding red velvet cake or sock it to me cake.... They all taste great....   I most definitly will say that you should give this place a try....  Mmmmmm.....Mmmmm..... Good.....!!!',5
'This place is a treasure for having little treats from Germany that I really miss.  Jams hazelnut wafers dumpling mixes and tons of little bottles of condiments to pair with sausages.  And oh boy the sausages are good!  There are so many different kinds that it makes it hard to only pick a few.',4
'The weather is awesome right now and now is the time to go to shopping centers like Kierland.  Over the past few years it has been one of my favorite places to visit from the Fall through Spring season.  It reminds me of Town Square in Las Vegas (one of my fav places of all time).  There are a ton of restaurants here.....Bobbys Jazz Lounge North Mastros PF Changs Chloes Corner Zinc Bistro....and much more.  We enjoy grabbing an Ice Cream at Cold Stone and walking around.  Its also fun to bring our dogs for a leisurely stroll window shopping.  Definitely worth stopping by if youre in the area.  Return Factor - 100%',5
'Took our guests from Ohio to see this unique place and we wanted to see it too. We waited over 45 minutes and no one showed to open the gates. Very under managed and disorganized. We left to see other sites could not wait all day!!',1
'My boyfriend and I went to this place for the first time tonight. The gentleman who took our order was very friendly and polite and gave us two servings of soup on the house.      The food was fantastic . The lentil soup was to die for. The hummus was delicious the chicken kabob was tender and tasty.     The restaurant was clean and well lit and the prices very reasonable. I am new to the area and have been looking for good locally owned establishments and this fits the bill. I will be going back',5
'I was at Mables last night. It was my first time and love the décor the ambiance and they clientele they are catering towards. Its my kind of place and its my kind of crowd.   I could talk about how much I like the bar setup but that would take away focus from whats really important; the food the drinks and the service.   The Happy Hour menu is good and has variety. I Had a little bit of this and a little bit of that. All great. I had a signature mixed drink that was very tasty but switched to rum&coke due to my mood.   The service was stellar. One girl kept track of orders and separate checks for a crowd of 20 people.. and doing so with outmost professionalism and a smile. I was very impressed.  Not only will I go back but I will take friends from out of town here.. besides what Mables is doing right the clientele is following suit. People were friendly and dressed nicely. Like the way I feel it should be.',5
'After hitting up several pizza joints in the area I finally found my go-to when Im craving NY style pizza!  I just moved here a couple months ago from NJ where theres a pizza shop on every block and this was the closest one in quality to the ones back home.  The crust folded well  in my hands and the cheese pulled apart like the way mozarella should!  Their Chicken Parm sandwich was very tasty as well though not as good as the ones back home. The staff was very friendly and though prices are okay its still not the same for some reason.  Maybe its the water? But overall this is my spot for NY Pizza!  Give me Benny Tudinos in Hoboken NJ anytime!!!',4
'Thank god for Teds Hot Dogs!  There is nothing better in life than a charbroiled hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  My cohorts at work turned me onto Teds and I kept it secret from my wife.  Yes Im that cruel.  Then one Sunday morning we were watching one of those Top 10 Hot Dog shows on the Food Network or Travel Channel.  She said to me I wish we could have a great hot dog today.  I broke down and wept confessing my multiple sins of all the times I tip toed to Teds to enjoy a chili footlong dog and an all beef dog with the works. She loving me immediately hit me a couple of times about the head and said Get dressed bitch - lunch is on you.  Now if you ever meet Marie youll come to know that she is sweet and understanding but on that day I found one of her few limits.  Needless to say we had a great experience at Teds that Sunday.  REMEMBER:  They only take cash.  No debit cards no credit cards no bartering.',5
'Horrible!! The food was gross and after bringing me the wrong item twice the server didnt even offer to take my meal off the tab. We were the only table in there and the server messed up everyone elses order too. When it was time to pay he got every bodies tab wrong he handed me my tab at 8:00 and then grabbed it out of my hand. By the time I payed it was 8:30 and Im sure it was the wrong amount but by that time I just wanted to leave. Also they brought the birthday girl her cake after most if the party left.',1
'While my boyfriend is in town for Nascar  he and his team stay down the street at a hotel near this bar and grill. Looking for nightlife options midweek this is what we found. Not bad! We sat at the bar. I ordered my famous snakebite... and yeah.. they had to ask but they did it and it came out very well. Had to have two since they opened two ciders and two guinness to make the drink. Good music.. some nights there is karaoke. The staff is super friendly and accommodating. The quesadilla on the appetizer menu is shareable and became a craveable favorite of my boyfriend and myself. Good bar!',4
'Taco Tuesday. Probably the best one around. $1.50 for a shredded beef taco and that includes a crispy shell and lots of beef and even sour cream. The tecates are 2 bucks also. The bartender was very friendly and I had the bar to myself at 8:30pm (dont show up at 7pm). Free chips and salsa and the green salsa is the finest in the land.',4
'Love this place.  Will definitely return.',5
'I keep hearing great comments about this place and since I love TORTAS  decided to give it a try. Walk in place thinking will be a fast way to take dinner home but oh boy I was wrong!!!!. I waited there for like 20 minutes by cashier to place my order and a waiter came and went but never even asked me if I needed help. So I decided to leave. The most disappointment part was that place wasnt even full. In fact only one table with a couple was occupied. Id never went back and do not intent to do so. Im giving it one star because I didnt try food and it doesnt let me post review without it. :/',1
'My first visit to Fez will definitely not be my last!  The happy hour drink specials were a great way to start a memorable evening. I ordered the cinnamon dusted sweet potato fries as a starter to share with my 4 companions.  They were perfectly prepared--just the right combo of crispy spicy salty--and the 5 of us were unable to finish them all!  We each ordered a different entree and every plate except mine was clean.  The Tangier burger was amazing with garlicky hummus tasty manchego cheese pesto oven dried tomatoes (that thankfully were not over-dry and chewy) and a half pound of delicious beef served on just the right proportion of ciabatta bread.  I just couldnt eat it all but look forward to having the leftovers for lunch today.  A great surprise was the extra large cup of coffee after dinner.  I hope my email to the restaurant will result in them telling me what blend of coffee they use...it was heavenly!  The ambiance of FEZ is lively:  sleek and urban is accurate.  Early on a Friday night the place was crowded and noisy and it does attract a young-ish crowd (um I felt old but that wont inhibit me from a return trip)!  Another plus:  excellent service.',5
'This Residence Inn is a little hard to find even though it is right off I-17 and Northern. It is on a one-way frontage road so you have to come from the north of Northern Avenue and slide down the frontage road to get to it. It is on hotel row for this area just a mile form the Metro Center and a bunch other hotels on eaither side of the freeway.   It is a typical Residence Inn. It is a group of about 20 low rise 2 story buildings. Parking is adequate and nearby your door.   Inside this member of the Marriott chain is known as an extended stay type hotel with a 2 room suite which includes about 600 sq ft of space. There is a full kitchen with 4 burner stove full fridge microwave and dishwasher all in new stainless steel with marble counter tops and a wood/linoleum floor. Full dishes glasses and utenzils are available like home.   This one is pretty new with clean unstained furniture in fresh condition. There are also not 1 but 2 black 42 inch LG flat screen TVs. one in the bedroom and one in the living room. The living room has a desk 2 seat dining table a lounge chair and a small sofa with sofa bed. There is a door between the rooms so if you wanted to have the kids along you can still keep your sanity in the other room.  Depending on time of year this R.I. is a good value costing about $100/night which includes a free breakfast evening hospitality hour free Wi-FI internet and free parking.   This little one bedroom if it was a condo near downtown San Francisco would be a million dollars!  If you really want to save money you can go next door to Motel 6 and pay $40/night for a single person! Just ignore the riff raff!',3
'I recently went to GB on a Tuesday night with some friends for a drink or two around 8 pm. The place was not busy at all. There were only a few patrons here. The place was a ghost town.   We sat down in the cocktail area and waited and waited for someone to come over to take our order. Nobody ever came. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes we left. The hostess in the stairway was shocked we were leaving so soon.. We told her why.  I can understand a wait when the place is busy but when there is almost nobody there this is inexcusable!  I really liked going to GB but this night GB was subpar.',2
'Tiny mom-n-pop shop with wonderful food delightfully homey atmosphere and a charming ancient server who makes you feel perfectly content to wait a little longer than usual for food and drinks that are well worth the wait and the regular (non-divey) prices.    We tasted many of the tamales and appetizers and even picked them up for Christmas dinner one year - delicious!!  The only downside is that they are authentic so Im fairly certian they use lard and such.  We live a bit far these days so we rarely venture out there.  Please have some yummy tamales there for me!',4
'SWITCH WILL YOU MARRY ME?  As far as casual American cuisine this is the good stuff! The Sangria Chicken salad was like a party in my mouth and yes EVERYONE was invited. The service was good as the wait staff was very attentive.   Ill be back within the week. This boy is in love!',5
'We grabbed dinner at the Streets of New York this evening what a great meal.  I had the cheese ravioli with pesto sauce and my husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  Fabulous!  We started with artichoke and spinach dip with flatbread appetizer and the bread sticks and marinera sauce num.   Our server was so sweet and helpful--what a nice way to end a good day.',5
'Thanks you so much Dry Bar!!!  I purchased the Groupon for this place for a special occasion....my birthday!  I was able to make an appointment the same day as my birthday celebration.  I have to admit if youre not familiar with Scottsdale Quarter trying to find Dry Bar is a little tricky (its between the yogurt place & Grimaldis).    I was greeted with great customer service and they even remembered that it was my birthday (bonus points).  I was offered a glass of champagne and was whisked away to get my hair washed.  My groupon included a 10 minute scale massage and I highly recommend adding this service to your blowout.   Jessica did a fantastic job on my hair!  I have natural curly hair and lots of it!  She was able to blow dry my hair and style it faster than I could ever do.  I wish she could style my hair every morning!  Check out Dry Bar for an amazing blowout!  Its not a bad deal for $35 (wash blowout and style).  I would use them again for another special occasion!  Thanks for giving me amazing hair for my birthday!',5

'Jade Palace rules. Two coworkers and I discovered this location purely by accident as we drove to Chipotle and decided to eat here instead. The soup was good. The entrees were good. The restaurant was clean and busy with area worker-bees. The cost was less than 8 bucks per person. How the hell did we miss this place for so long?',4
'I really did give this place a chance going back 6 times trying different things hoping to find something great..with each return I never found anything I would recommend.. But the most incredible thing was seeing the owner in line at safeway with a huge amount of packages of store brand lunch meat for sandwiches.. for the price they are charging for their food i never would have expected that.. Also I think he needs some new shoes crocs really in a restaurant and being the owner..Cmon Now! Never in a million years will i return here!',1
'Always a safe bet for quick and efficient service and who doesnt like Einsteins bagels!!!  This is location is always busy but it is clean an the bagels are solid.',5
'Terrible experience there recently. The service was rude and like another reviewer wrote it seemed like the employee was put out.  Ive been here several times and this is the first time Ive had this happen but I guarantee its the last because I wont be back.  The food is okay to pretty good depending on what you order but it is terribly overpriced.  Its okay to overcharge for a burger-but you at least smile when you do it.',2

'Loved my microdermabrasion facial with Summerr.  Booked a second one right away.  Great products too....but shes not pushy to sell them.',5
'There really are few words to describe how perfect the food is how delectable the salas are how great the waitstaff is and how awesome the vibe is. Sufficeth to say we come here at least twice a month (we have to hold ourselves back!).  Since my husbands from SoCal and Im a born and bred Austinite we both grew up eating delicious Mexican food. But I have to say that La Condesa truly beats out even my favorite spots in San Diego or Austin (sorry hometown! you still have the best migas!). They are truly Taco Royalty.  Our favorite tacos: Mayan Cochinita Pibil Arrachera (carne asada) the El Guacho and the shark taco. Also you must try their margaritas and horchata!',5
'food is decent and the beer selection is good.  service is the worst.  ive been there over 5 times now and every time it gets worse.  one time we sat in an empty restaurant for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to come to the bar and wait on us.  last night we went there during happy hour and then got the bill with full price food on it.  we asked why it wasnt happy hour pricing and the waiter says i gave you the regular price portion we said we ordered the food during happy hour we assumed that youd bring us the happy hour food  he literally just stared for about 20 seconds like wed just spoken a foreign language.  then he said well maybe you ordered it after 6pm.  the woman i was with said the receipt is time stamped at 549 he goes well i guess i could give you the happy hour price then but the portions for that are much smaller.  total jackass.   i know that the face of the restaurant is the service and if they are lousy or have a bad day that will reflect poorly on the restaurant which may not be to blame.  but after 5 times i can safely say there are better alternatives to this place.  so many restaurants within a 5 mile radius - dont go here.',1
'Garys Grotto is by far the best; food service music & location.  Wine selection is fantastic!  We just love going to the Grotto!  A must for anyone visiting Old Towne Scottsdale or who lives in AZ.  If you havent been there; GET THERE.  Youre missing out on a great afternoon or evening.  Michelle Turner Bill Scherrer',5
'Ive been to both the evening regular service and the mid-day dim sum.  Visited 3 times in total and was never disappointed!  The food is excellent quality Chinese food and not just decent fast-food-esque Chinese.  Dim sum is also very cheap -for $20 3 of us had plenty to eat and even took home leftovers.  The only possible downsides are that the dim sum is not a place for vegetarians.  Also an Asian friend of mine was a little bothered that all the servers directed their questions to her and kind of ignored me and another white girl.  I blew it off because that was par for the course in Japan and Im used to it.  Its not worth fussing about when the food is so good. :)',5
'Peggy & Peter are wonderful! Great quality great tasting & great service. Always enjoy eating at Morning Star.',5
'Overrated.  I moved to AZ about two years ago and the one place all of my new coworkers told me I absolutely had to try was Pizzeria Bianco. After reading about its rich history and lines that make people wait upwards of 3 hours for I thought there had to be something of this legend and gave it a shot. My fiancee seemed more excited than I was because (as she constantly claims) she is a pizza fanatic with marinara sauce pumping through her veins.  We made the journey out about half an hour before they opened to ensure we wouldnt have to wait the customary amount of time and wasnt surprised to see a line of about fifteen more arrive soon after. We were the first to order and chose the WiseGuy pizza (onions mozzarella and sausage).  The first thing I noticed that seemed a little off putting was that there didnt seem to be a chef handling the pizza but a couple of simple line cooks. I played it off thinking it didnt matter much because how hard is it really to make a a pizza? The ingredients and recipe were going to be the stars of the show.  Even though we were the first to order we waited approximately thirty minutes before the pizza arrived. Again I didnt think much of it at the time because in my mind pizza of this legendary caliber was worth waiting for.  Once it finally arrived we couldnt wait to dive in but I gave it a few moments to lessen the blow of any potential cheese burns seeing as it came fresh from the oven. My first bite was completely underwhelming. This pizza didnt have any flavor at all. The dough itself was very pleasing with a nice blend crispy and chewy textures but the cheese onions and sausage tasted of nothing. I never thought pizza could taste so bland. My fiancee shared the same sentiments. I thought she was joking at first and maybe I was being a little too critical but after one slice we stopped paid our bill and walked out of there.  Ive never seen a place hyped so much that went completely in the opposite direction. There are much better places in AZ to get a great slice of pizza but for my money Pizzeria Bianco isnt worth the time or effort.',2
'Simple inexpensive delicious.  Not only are the ingredients fresh the restaurant clean and staff friendly the food speaks for itself.  I was so impressed with the authenticity of the Oxacan food here that I have been back for more many many more tacos.  Its rare that this place is slow but when it is Ive had the opportunity to talk a bit with the owner.  He is so enthusiastic about his food and it shows.  My usual routine is to order my food (Ive tried it all and its all fantastic) then walk around the corner to the liquor store and get a beer.  By the time I get back to the restaurant my food is ready and I eat.  Beer + tacos... Its perfect.  The menu is simple and the prices are great.',5
'Im writing this review from a comfie seat in the Copper Star cafe itself using its free wifi. For a laptop-wielding downtown resident like myself outlet accessibility is as important as wifi and this place gets the thumbs up. The owner and staff are very friendly. They seem genuinely delighted to see every customer walk in. The place is fairly packed and I recognize the faces of at least two fellow downtown professionals as I sit here. The coffee is good. The scones are excellent. The ambiance reflects exactly what I look forward to as the future of downtown Phoenix:  scaled down unpretentious but urban; loft-like bricks and open ductwork. Given its proximity to my home Ill probably spend many weeknights here when I have late projects.',5
'dont bother.  the employees are the worst.   its quite sad actually because the espresso drinks are out of this world amazing. still i wont be back. ever.',1
'Great food at a great price. The steaks and pork chops were amazing; Im still dreaming for their mashed potatoes. DO NOT MISS the butter cake!!!!!!! Love it!!',5
'This place is awesome! I came in based on the previous reviews and I wasnt disappointed. My car was sounding like a rice rocket so I brought it in - turns out two welds had popped off of the exhaust. $20 and 5 minutes later everything was perfect! Wish I had come in sooner this week and had my brakes done but at least I know for next time! Plus if you choose to wait for your car - The Yard is RIGHT NEXT DOOR!',5
'My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and both times we werent disappointed.  From the steak and burgers to the salmon and fries everything tasted just as it should.  That might be a problem for some people who are looking for above average tasting food but for someone whos just looking for a nice sit-down meal in a calm atmosphere after a long day its perfect.  Both times my steak was cooked just right the fries were just crispy enough the drinks (arnold palmer) were made with just the right amount of tea and lemonade.  Js salmon was flaky and his meatloaf was actually quite moist and delicious with the gravy.    Again it is quite average there are no over-the top flavours here but it is safe and comfortable and the staff is more than accomodating (sometimes to the point where you will have 3 people helping each other with their tables) in every aspect.',4
'Best Chinese food in the East Valley! Having visited China multiple times this place is on point with their food. Will go back time and time again.',5
'I went to Sing High thirty minutes before the Suns game on Sunday. It was my mistake because it took longer than i thought it would have.  When we first go their we were greeted by a nice lady who took us to our seats. We looked though the menu and before our drinks came to us we were ready to order.   An elderly waitress took our order and drinks. I ran out of water and only had one glass the whole time i was there. Then after waiting for a while our appetizer came. Pot stickers.  They were good and we demolished them. Partly because we were hungry mostly because they were good. I have had pot stickers all over the place but these are my favorite so far.   As I ran out of water our food came and we had to ask for two plates so we could share our dishes. My friend and I order two plates. My favorite Beef Fried Rice and she got Bell Pepper Beef.  You cant go wrong with Beef Fried Rice but the Bell Pepper Beef was decent. If anything the lady who was serving us was sweet and polite. You cant beat that.   I am going to go back to SIng High because it has that older Chinese restaurant feel i like so much. I only hope they improve the next time i am there so I can give them the five stars iI think they deserve.',4
'Menu selection disappointing. Cob salad was good though. Being named the Adobe restaurant i expected a couple tex-mex selections.  Nope typical golf club restaurant.  Expected more from the Biltmore.  Bummer!',2
'A lively mid-range restaurant. The crowd was mixed but was comprised mostly of families. Strangely they played clubby music in the background.   Service was really good there were about five people servicing our table as a team. Everything came out quickly and they were able to accommodate all the bizarre dietary needs of our finicky group.  The food itself was pretty basic. The big eye tuna ceviche was a significant deviation from real deal it appeared to have small pieces of tortilla chips mixed in which through me off. The chicken fajitas were fine but werent a huge step up from something you could get at a chain.  Final word: Ok for a casual or family dinner.',3

'Hannys ... you have quite the tasty Riesling.   But...your service leaves a tad bit to be desired.  On the flip side you have hot hot hot bartenders so I really dont mind the wait (sorry DG).  My favorite thing about you is your bathrooms. I mean I really really love the bathrooms.   Actually I love the entire place. If I were going to open a bar I would want it to look exactly like Hannys. Well except the meat cutter at the bar because I am vegetarian. Perhaps I would get an industrial strength cheese cutter. (ha ha ... cheese cutter!)  Ooooo another bonus... you are right off of the light rail and you normally have parking available right outside... therefore I consider you to be in a good location.  Yeah Hannys ... I love you. Quite a bit. Lets go steady.',4
'I really enjoyed this place.  Came here after shopping with my mom and wanted to try some place new within Fashion Square Mall.  Our hostess was awesome!  We wanted patio seating with a heater...it was cold in the shade and she made it happen.    Our server was awesome too she was very helpful and answered all our questions as this was our 1st visit.  We started with drinks and then she suggested appetizers -chips with their onion dip.  AWESOME!  They were delicious.  We decide to split the chicken salad and she warned us it had mayo ....classic chicken salad.  Glad she mentioned that.  We also ordered the soup of the day which was yesterdays soup and it was excellent.    The staff was awesome and the food was great.  We both enjoyed our chips salad and soup along with our wines.  The whole experience was great!  Yes...I would come here again.',4
'My thoughts on this place could fill a book. I like having my oil changed and car washed. Like a spring renewal no matter the time of year. Sometimes I feel like the stuff they tell me about my car is legit. Sometimes I feel like its not. For instance the passenger compartment air filter. They were totally right that it needed replacing. I was not all flattered by the $49 cost. I went on Amazon while I was there and bought two for $14.99. And then I went to youtube to find out how to replace it. That sort of thing. For what they do they do really well. For what they SELL well theyre not a not for profit.',4
'Mediocre food horrible horrible service.  Made my Mom wife myself and two kids feel like we were a burden by being there.  We were sat outside it was in the high 90s  we sweated it out for over a half an hour until another couple arrived and they immediately turned on the fans and mister system.  I will never eat or go to this restaurant again unless I want to feel like a third class citizen.  Besides the food is nothing special',1
'Nellos is perhaps one of the best pizzas per cost in Phoenix.  My wife actually prefers them over many of those up scale fancy pizza parlors.  Overall they have a very good consistency and have won my heart. Try their buffalo chicken pizza (Im an anti chicken on pizza guy but this deserves an exception).',4
'The four star rating perfectly describes how I feel about Martini Ranch - Im a fan.  I love the diversity in this place.  Though Im not very fond of the Shaker Room I love the fact that they are one of the few places in old town that continue to promote live rock and somehow I always end up leaving in a blacked-out state.  In fact Ive left my debit card behind the bar twice; having to walk-of-shameingly grab it the next day during daylight.  The service is pretty good even when the bar is packed and the upstairs patio is an excellent place for me to accidentally smoke against my will.  This is a great place to take midwestern out of towners - with the wide open areas and the mixture of moods.',4
'Frank S.s honest down-to-earth style long history in the Phoenix community and great prices are what keeps me sending my colleagues and acquaintances his way.  You wont find him amidst the oneupping dealers on Camelback trying to outdo each other with blow-up signs and false advertising. No hidden tricks or lemon shenanigans just straightforward honest and no-pressure deals.  Check out his new covered parking lot. Those are (going to be) solar electric panels on top!',5
'I use Yelp as a guide for lots of things. So when I recently got a photo ticket for Failure to Stop at a Red Light  at 12th St & Camelback (I swear I thought that yellow was going to last longer! $280 says WRONG!) and the follow-up letter that I had to attend Traffic Survival School I came here to get some guidance on which school from the MVD list I should choose. I didnt really find what I was looking for so I crossed my fingers and chose Absolutely Just My Luck Traffic Survival School and Im glad I did.   Online registration was easy- and I even saved $5 by doing it online (prices vary but for the Sunday class it was the best rate I could find- $55). They were great about immediately confirming my reservation and even sent out a reminder a day or so before the class which was really helpful.   The location I chose which was in Bud Crawleys Real Estate School on the corner of 16th St & Colter was also in a really central location. If you go it can be a little tricky to find as its in the back of the lot but they have signs out to lead you there (and on a Sunday if you just follow the other cars in the lot youll find it).  Having never gone to Traffic Survival School I didnt know what to expect but it was way better than I anticipated for having to sit in a classroom for 8 hours on a Sunday.  The teacher Marcia who has been an instructor for 10-1/2 years was really friendly and just overall very cool from the start. She had us all introduce ourselves and why we were there- and I was surprised by how many other red-light tickets were in the room (maybe about half of the 25 students- a few even at my same light). Also just an important note... If you do get a red light ticket GO TO DEFENSIVE DRIVING SCHOOL! It will save you money in the long run (and points on your license which will raise your insurance rates). And if you havent had any other moving violations in 24 months you can go. Note: Traffic Survival School & Defensive Driving School are 2 different things.  Anyway back to the class... Marcia really made it a very interactive experience. And even though we had to watch some ancient videos about driving safety and do some quizzes (as groups) I actually walked away having learned a lot from the class. She was also really great about letting us take some breaks throughout the class and we also got a lunch break. But just dont take advantage of her because she definitely has the boundaries she needs to keep the schools approval by MVD. I really appreciated all of the real-life info she passed along to us (AZ is up there with the big cities in the nation for driving fatalities- and the numbers are going up sadly) as well as hearing her own personal story about what led her into this path as an instructor. I really feel like I left the class a more-alert less-distracted very conscious driver. It reminded me of how important it is to pay attention while driving (drive defensively!) to not take stupid risks (like thinking I can clear a yellow light or take my eyes off the road for a second to change a song) and how ultimately your life is in your (and the drivers around you) hands every time you drive.  If you find yourself needing a Traffic Survival School I would definitely recommend Marcia and Absolutely Just My Luck Traffic Survival School.',5
'Heidi and Doug not only helped furnish a third of my house with distinct mid-century pieces they also continue to infuse 7th Ave. (and all of Central Phoenix) with community-minded events lectures and parties.  They are very knowledgeable in Danish Modern especially and they offered fair deals (when compared with Red Modern).  I went to the kickoff party for Modern Phoenix Week and Doug and Heidi let us carry on well past the posted party hours.  What a great space to linger and luxuriate with Bertoia Eames Sottsass Saarinen Jacobsen and others.  The house cats harness is precious too.  With Modern Manor next door this may be a one-stop mid-century plop.',5
'Love the deals here!!! We shop here all the time and you can get some GREAT deals on more high priced items that you would find in Macys or other more upscale stores.  Definately NOT Walmart quality here! BUT you get great high quality stuff at the Walmart prices!! I didnt give them 5 Stars only because every once in a while I have to return an item because it was a second. Other than that I dont think it is the norm to get seconds there...',4
'Food is great.  Prices are high and not a lot of parking.  Overall great coffee shop and Pizza place',5
'Had an awesome lunch. Waiter had no personality hard to hear and zero energy. The shave ribeye & cheddar was amazing.',4
'No dings on this one. Always a great time and the food is terrific. Service is friendly and personal. Drinks are generous. Perfect up scale dinner house light level - makes everyone look good. I cant think of anything I would change. The house rotisserie chickens are featured in a showcase on the south side of the building...Im sure just to get you salivating. (Also check out their Flying Chicken - under the radar takeout via the back door. Very Cute) Not a huge menu but lots of comfort items great variety and consistently excellent all the way. Deviled eggs cornbread gets a big thumbs up and Im a big fan of the Macho Salad. I could eat that everyday. Cant wait to go again! Soon.',5
'Ive been to Kazimierz multiple times but each time grow a little more disappointed and wish I could honestly give it a higher rating.  The good: The atmosphere is fantastic. Its unlike anything else in Scottsdale and the wine cave vibe always impresses people that have never been. Im also sold on any place that features wine and cheese platters.  The bad: Service can be terrible. When I was last there it was a not very busy week night. As a group of 6 we were easily seated but from then on out it was impossible to track down our waitress. If she had been around a bit more we might have ordered more. The timing of any food coming out was completely erratic. However the most offensive part was the wine by the bottle list. They have a binder with 50-100 pages of wines by the bottle. The first bottle I asked about the waitress checked and said they didnt have. I then asked about 6 or 7 other wines and each when she said No we dont have that and didnt even check. She was either lazy or that book is pointless to look through. She had suggested 3 different bottles (none of which fit what I was looking for) then said if I got something they served by the glass they would surely have that. To me it defeats the entire point since they dont have that many by the glass. We each just ended up getting glasses of wine and gave up on trying to get a bottle.  In summary it has a great atmosphere but dont expect service and dont take the wine book too seriously. Its not likely they will actually have the bottle youre interested in.',3
'Wow!  I loved this place.  We went for happy hour (5:00) before we went to the Phx Art Museum.  Amazing bar food.  I had the Slopy Joe and a big fat pretzel.  Carbs anyone?!?  The beer selection was great.  Our waitress was super friendly and informed.  I also loved the decor.  I would have stayed longer but our little guy Evan was a bit too excited - I think the really loud music was a bit too much for him and to be honest even though we loved what they were playing it was a bit too loud for us too.  I cant wait to go back but we will leave the little guy at home so we can really dig in and stay a while!',5
'I love this place! Been frequenting for over a year and it never disappoints.  The clientele can be bizarre from time to time but the bartenders are amazing and they have great customer service!  Music is usually epic and the food is unbelievable. Definitely recommended.',5
'Went here because we had a coupon for free 16oz so we gave it a try.  it was delicious.  staff was very friendly and let us sample as much as we wanted.  we tried the red velvet cake (which i recommend) pineapple blueberry acai lemon vanilla and orange.  didnt care too much for the orange it was too bitter.  but the other flavor were magnificent.  the pineapple blueberry lemon and vanilla went really well together. they can expect us back soon  Did i mention the plethora of toppings???  its endless and delicious!',4
'La Piazza Al Forno Gourmet Brick Oven Pizzeria and Italian Kitchen    Dining Review  By LeeAnn Sharpe   La Piazza Al Forno Gourmet Brick Oven Pizzeria and Italian Kitchen 5803 W. Glendale Ave. in Historic Downtown Glendale. 623-847-3301 Hours Mon-Thur Lunch 11am-3pm Dinner 5pm-8pm Fri-Sat 11am-9pm Select Sundays. Website: www.lapiazzaalforno.blogspot.com  Their menu states Our passion is crafting delicious Italian meals using simple time honored recipes... Just like the original Pizzerias and Trattorias of Italy La Piazza is a place for friends and family to gather for good food.   It was just by chance that my friends and I ended up at La Piazza. But what a fortuitous chance that was. Just south of Murphy Park at 58th Ave & Glendale its tucked away in an almost hidden store front. The food was excellent and the people very friendly. And the prices were very moderate with generous portions.   We all started off with a side salad of mixed greens cherry tomatoes cheese and cucumbers with a nice Italian dressing $3. A basket of Italian Bread was $1.50. They offer a short beer and wine list. We had a nice house red wine $5.25 glass. They also offer Calamari $7 Shrimp $7 and Bruschette $3 for Appetizers and a good variety of salads as well.   My favorite has always been Chicken Marsala and its one dish I always compare at any new Italian restaurant. The Chicken Marsala is a grilled chicken breast topped with mushrooms in a Marsala Wine Sauce with a side of pasta $10. It was delicious and large enough serving to make two meals. It made a great lunch the next day!   Spaghetti with Marinara Sauce $7 or with Meatballs or Italian Sausage $9 both were tasty and filling. My friend is sensitive to too spicy foods but enjoyed the meatballs saying they were just right. Just like Momma used to make! Another had the Italian Sausage and was very pleased with the taste and texture. Some places are too greasy but these were perfect and flavorful.   The menu offers Ravioli $8 Parmigiano $8 Scampi $12 Linguine $10 Rigatoni $10 Lasagna $9 and Fettuccine Alfredo $8 as you would expect from any respectable Italian restaurant. They offer a selection of sandwiches including Meatball $6 Sausage & Peppers $6 and The Godfather $6.   But saving the best for last you have to try their pizza! The wood fueled brick oven pizza brings you back to the classic pizza of years past. The crust has texture volume and flavor to it and is crispy and tasty. Fresh ingredients like mozzarella ricotta basil and garlic generously top a pie you can pick up in your hand and feel some weight. They offer a nice menu of Specialty Pizzas with a wide selection of traditional (not designer) toppings for only $11 for the 14 to $17 for the 16. If you want a pizza with real taste check this one out. Its a real treat after too many plastic and cardboard tasting pizzas the chains serve up. Now that Im spoiled for good pizza it will have to be La Piazzaa!   A family operation La Piazza Al Forno owned by the Piazzas (Justin Rachel Dennis Anita and the kids) will make you enjoy family dinners out without breaking the bank and in an atmosphere you will feel comfortable. And the food will make you smile as much as the company!    Published Arizona Panoramic Horizons www.azphm.com',5
'Aaron is best cashier this side of town fast and friendly',4
'Stopped by this Fud location on our way up to the Anthem outlets last night.  J had a free birthday burger coming to him.    We were informed that the coupon only covered a basic burger.  No cheese..nada.  And that toppings were à la carte.  So if you wanted to order a Inferno burger you had to pay for the cheese jalapenos and whatever else comes on it that you cant get at the toppings bar.  $1 a piece.    I got a 1/3 lb burger (1/3 is unfortunately the smallest you can order..I seem to remember ordering a 1/4 at the tempe location for my birthday in Feb..maybe im mistaken. *Shrug*) with satueed onions and blue cheese.  The burger was cooked to my liking which was a plus.  And they didnt chince on the onions or blue cheese.  The fries were maybe luke warm at best.    One of the positive things about dinner last night -  Mondays all kids meals are only 99cents.  Baby C enjoed his grilled chicken sandwich.  The chicken seemed on the small side as it did not take up the whole bun.  I tossed away most of the bun cause I didnt want him having all that bread.   It came with fries or fruit and I got him fruit.  What came was half an apple sliced.  Coulda gotten that at home.  *shrug*  At least Baby Cs meal was only 99cents.',3
'First time here & we absolutely loved it!  My boyfriend had the Secret Wonder Bat sandwich and said it was extremely tasty!  He was intrigued by the eggplant bacon so he ordered a side of it.  We both agree with one of the previous reviews that this did fall a little flat.  But he loved the fresh lemonade and when he asked how they made it the waitress went and got the exact mixture from the baker so my boyfriend felt that more than made up for the bacon.  I ordered the Frank Lloyd Bite which was delicious  but A LOT of food.   My boyfriend had to help out!!!  With this one  the pancakes were by far my favorite but I also enjoyed the Rosemary potatoes and the bwiscuit & gwavy side!  Well definitely be back to this charming diner!!!!!',5
'We sat outside with a group of friends.  The waitress was knowledgeable and handled our group requests without a problem.  Manager even turned the channel to the game we wanted.  The grilled shrimp and the chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries were both really good.  I would rather hang out at this sports bar than some others around town:  clean good food & drinks nice staff and not over crowded.',4
'There was a Groupon for Papa Murphys so we thought we would try it. Im glad I only paid $10. Ive had better frozen pizza.',2
'I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently. Always able to find what I need. Clean and organized will come again.',4
'This place is the bomb.com. one of the better gyro places Ive had in the west coast and the best one in AZ ive tried.  Not sure what to make for dinner? Just go to Georges gyros and get yourself a half chicken half gyro platter with extra taziki sauce.  youll have enough food left over to take to lunch the next day... they give you sooo much food. if youre feeling like a fattie for life like me  get yourself a baklava for dessert.   helpful tip: call in advance. if you go in person and make the order you will end up waiting 15 mins or more.. they take a while to make their food.',4
'The sushi quest continues.  And we decided to check out one of the more promising places in the East Valley.  So we rolled into Shimogamo a small place next to C-Fu Gourmet and across the street from Lee Lee Market.  With neighbors this Asian they have to be legit right?  The first thing I noticed was a nice list of fish and roll options but a limited set of specials.  Thats fine maybe we can see if theres anything theyre not telling us about... Or ask the chef to make us something interesting.  We started with the beef carpaccio.  Carpaccio is typically thinly sliced meat served raw with some marinade scallions and other garnishes.  This one was supposed to be seared but it came out medium.  It was pretty good but could have been much better if it were actually served rare.  Next we had something we asked the chef to surprise us with.  Disappointingly the chef didnt come over and tell us what he made and the waitress didnt seem to know.  But it involved a tempura-fried whitefish on a bed of Japanese veggies and a tough of tobiko.  It was good but we were definitely hoping for something a little more interesting.  Probably the least memorable surprise weve had from a sushi chef yet.  Next we had albacore and escolar sushi.  They were both good and came garnished so I didnt add any soy sauce to those... And they were conveniently on the happy hour menu.  Bonus!  We had a spider roll afterwards and while Im not usually a fan of rolls I always like a good soft-shelled crab.  This one was better than some of the others Ive had on account of the fact that it also had avocado.   The waitress then brought us our shrimp sashimi (with the fried shrimp heads - make sure you ask for that if you order the fresh shrimp!).  These shrimp were huge and fresh.  Plus as an added bonus the heads came stuffed to the brim with goodies.  Im not exactly sure what the goodies are but they have a distinct flavor and I suspect it is a mix of central nervous system and the free-form liver/pancreatic capabilities that most crustaceans are endowed with.  We had the tuna poke which seems to be Shimogamos signature dish.  It tastes great but it is quite basic.  Basically just tuna and avocado topped with a lightly fried quail egg.  This is one of those times when less is more is true.  After this we had another item on the specials board the orange yellowtail.  This is yellowtail sashimi marinaded with citrus flavor served with sliced avocado and a touch of sriracha.  This was actually pretty delicious.  Finally we finished with salmon roe and scallop nigiri and quail eggs.  The salmon roe was some of the best Ive had in awhile (they didnt have that fishy flavor that you sometimes get at a place with limited quality control).  Unfortunately a few of the things we wanted to order were not available.  They didnt have any uni baby yellowtail or toro which was really quite a bummer.  The owner explained to us that the market price is simply too high right now for him to be able to avoid throwing a bunch out so I appreciate his willingness to only serve what he can guarantee to be fresh.  Some of this is the fault of their clientele who from what I could tell is very caucasian and might not be interested in paying top dollar for a great cut of fish.    My final verdict on Shimogamo is that its good but a clear step below the best sushi places Ive been to.  Everything was fresh and the dishes were well-executed.  Furthermore the prices were reasonable.  All of these make it a very respectable location and potentially the best in the East Valley (well have to try the competition of course).    Where they fall short is in two areas: first the menu (and it seems the chefs) lack creativity.  They do a limited set of dishes well but they dont seem to be food artists.  Its a little too generic.  Second the waitress didnt seem very knowledgeable about some of the menu items and had to ask the chef about a few things.  If she is relatively new I could give her a pass.  Shimogamo may compete for the best in East Valley subcategory but it cant quite hang in the top tier.',4
'Ranking this sandwhich place is tough simply because I think I ordered the wrong thing and cant give it an honest review.  For whatever reason I ordered the Slaw Turkey which is a turkey sandwhich stacked high with cole slaw.  It sounded good when I ordered it but then I realized that I dont really like coleslaw that much.  It is good for a few bites as a side dish with your burger but a little too much when included in every bite of your turkey sandwhich. Bottom line.....I think this place has great potential.  I just need to be a little more conservative with my next sandwhich selection next go around.',3
'Attaching picture. Cut was not even and there is a black edge on the bagel. The amount of cream cheese is extremely tiny. Would it kill them to put more than a tiny thin layer of creamcheese on the bagel. And cut it down the center straight. What else does a bagel place really have to do',1
'I have to agree with Stevey about the nutrition of F&Es products but Im happy to have them close by. While not a Trader Joes which I would die for here F&E satisfies some of my needs. I find it hard to shop for everything here but they do have a somewhat diverse but limited selection. The nutrition of their pre-prepared foods is absolutely appalling. First almost all of the items Ive picked up have more than 500 calories a ton of fat and one item has 101% RDV of your daily sodium. I tried the magic 101% NaCl item the Penne Arrabiata and my mouth stung the rest of the afternoon from the sodium overdose. Some produce is overpriced but I like getting 1/2 off fruit platters that are Daily Specials (Enjoy By today) and their veggie meat is really good. Their wine is decent and closer than TJs plus they carry Tasty Bite and Amys frozen meals. I hope they work out the kinks and stick around.',3
'If I was an astronaut and going to get blasted to the INternational Space Station to eat packaged packet food...and I had one last meal prior to lift off....It would be Rusconis.  Greeted at the front door by Chef Michael Rusconi. Server was most attentive. Drinks very generous. Appetizer (Asparagus soup) was killer. Beet Salad...spectacular Entree...perfection Side dish of apple bread pudding with blue cheese on top...ORGASMIC Desert of Chocolate Coffee ice cream...delishiou Portions were great price was more than fair.  Actually a bargain  My wife and I have been in the Vally for 7 years.  This restaurant is one of the best we have ever eaten at.  We eat out three to four times a week....and this shot to the top of my list.  Been there twice and both experiences were over the top. Don;t miss it. Larry.  PS  The ONLY thing that I thought could use a touch of improvement; the bread was OK.  Easily fixed.  And..bread is full of carbs and I shouldn;t eat it anyway.  L O V E D  I T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',5
'There is something to be said for a giant  wheel o shots with every 2 oz beverage imaginable on it that you can spin 3 times for 7 dollars. It adds unpredictability value and the excitement of a game show to a tacky night in Scottsdale. Saturday night I was lucky enough to win a Hot White Load on the wheel. Its hilarity in name was equally matched by visual appeal of the drink itself. Some eerily seamen-colored butterscotch schnapps suspended like a mid-air ejaculation in some other harder clear alcohol.  But game show tacky is about as high as this place can aspire. Complete with strong-man boxing machines pirate decorations bar swings Bon Jovi blasting 36 oz domestic bottles of beer everywhere and midget led karaoke. If you are cohersed  into coming here as I often seem to be with my Scottsdale friends I recommend hitting the wheel as fast as possible and to try to enjoy the place for the carnival it is.  Although I dont know how it is possible as a female to do so. The thing about Scottsdale bars that always get to me is how seedy all the grown up frat boys and yuppies that frequent these establishments are once they get a couple of drinks in them. They treat it like once they reach a blood alcohol level of .08 on a non-school night it gives them legal license to grab the ass or grind on any young female who comes within 3 feet of them.   Giligins seems to be built for this purpose. A tiny little bar crowded with unwieldy wooden tables and carnival games with random crap happening at every little corner which makes it almost impossible to maneuver around for another giant bottle of Coors Light and a shot of Pink Pussy without grinding on a couple people. The girls that we were with on Saturday seemed to constantly have a look of terror in their eyes which dashed around like the islanders of Lost when they hear the sound of the Monster whenever they hear another douche bag coming that will likely treat his beer run as license to get friendly with girls they dont know.  I talked to one girl I was with about it who lived right by Old Town and she seemed almost surprised when I told her there were bars in the town where you could go without any fear of random boob grabs. While I heard some dudes talk about where to score some good cocaine after my second Pink Pussy shot of the night I told my friend who brought me there dude next week Im taking you to Chez Nous.',2
'Ive never tried an Acai Bowl before. I found this place on yelp and decided to try it on a whim. The young lady at the counter was friendly and knowledgeable. I tried the Go Green bowl because she said thats one of her favorites. Im glad I took her advice. It was delicious and affordable. Under $6 for a small (yet filling) bowl and a bottled water. The place has a nice laid back atmosphere with good music playing. Im definitely coming back again.',5
'Definite dive but the food was good.  They dont have carne Asada??!  That is weird to me...  Only green chile or red chile on the menu.  I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but thats way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town and if it wasnt daytime with my stud of a BF I would be concerned for my life and purse.  okay- back to the food.  The burrito was good.  The gauc is good.  It was all good but  the menu isnt something to RAVE about.  Im mexican so I could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called.',2
'I really liked this place. Great selection of goodies especially fishing reels.  They actually had Penn salt water reels. So I bought one. Needed it of course. They had everything I was looking for.',4
'Its restaurant week (RW) and I like going to a posh location for RW. I get all dolled up in a dress and heels and my boyfriend wears button down shirt and slacks. Silly me I was not really expecting a Bistro for some reason I was expecting something fancier with white linen table cloths or something like that for the price point. I felt overdressed. Well the candlelight was a nice romantic touch.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately upon arrival at the corner table. There was live music on the patio which I always enjoy.  Our waitress was nice and attentive. The busboys were also on top of their job which was great I hate having dirty plates just sitting there while Im chatting. We ordered off the special RW menu which came with a glass of sangria. I tried the white sangria which was light and fruity. I ordered the tostada for an appetizer and the boyfriend had the empanada. Both were pretty tasty. For Course 2 the boyfriend got the steak and cheddar mashed potatoes and I got the Seafood Chile Relleno with yummy cream corn and the most delicious cornbread. Both meals were good no complaints but the portions were huge we didnt even finish half of our meals. I got them to go. But not before having dinner I got the chocolate bread pudding and he got the Banana Burrito. I didnt like the Banana Burrito. The bread pudding almost tasted bland but that could because I had so many different flavors in my Course 2 dishes. Anyway I think I am not that partial to latin food so maybe thats why everything was just A-OK for me not spectacular. It was worth the try though.',3
'Overall I like this store and the selection - But I hate when these big stores list products on their websites without making it obvious they dont always carry them in the stores (bait and switch).  I was looking at a bike and some fitness equipment on their website then popped by to have a look in person only to find out the models I wanted were out of stock and the only comparable items they had were twice the price... After being told they would be available soon I popped in again several weeks later to find they were still on the way - from China Ill bet...  Arrrghhh!',3
'On time did a thorough a/c checkup made sure to remind me to change the filters regularly (had not been doing so).  Charged me a reasonable fee for service.',5
'As a lover of a good brew I really enjoy going to The Lost Leaf for a drink. Very laid back great live music (especially jazz) and an amazing selection of micro-brews. My personal favorite is Xingu a black beer but in no way a heavy stout. It was recommended to me by the bartender and he had recommended three other stellar beers to my friend and me while we were there. I really appreciate a bartender who knows his/her stuff.  The only reason Im giving this place 4 stars is due to the fact that it does not necessarily have a welcoming atmosphere. Of course this may be one of the reasons that so many others like The Lost Leaf so much but when I came here the first time I didnt feel like I was meant to be there. I no longer feel this way and enjoy going to The Lost Leaf often but that first time feeling always makes a difference.',4
'I have visited this location on many occasions and have been disappointed one too many times. Id say that going through the drive-thru has caused me more misery than necessary. Im sure theyve gotten my order wrong a minimum of 75% of the time and todays order included pickle stacked on the top (meaning outside) of the sandwich. Also while waiting at the drive-thru window one time I even had the employee chat me up a bit during a long wait for food. He had the nerve to complain that McDonalds required that he take a test and that he failed it. (Shocking!) Do yourself a favor and avoid this location at all costs.',2
'We dined at Binkleys last night and it was fantastic.  Possibly one of the best restaurant meals I have ever had.  I am a pretty picky eater - I dont like raw tuna fishy fish fatty meats or eggs.  Plus we do not eat pork.  As a result though I was really excited about trying this restaurant I was still a little nervous about liking the food.  I neednt have worried -- this restaurant is very high concept but very approachable.  There were four diners and we selected the five courses with wine pairings because we wanted to try everything.  Under that approach you get a cold appetizer hot appetizer fish meat/poultry cheese or dessert.  That said we actually had a total of 17 different plates!!!!  Before we even ordered the fantastic wait staff began bringing us goodies.  When we tried to identify a favorite this morning it was truly difficult because everything was so delicious.  And playful!  And cool!  The menu changes here everyday which is exciting and disappointing too because there are things I would defnitely like to try again.  But when I think about it I suppose it is no big deal because I cant wait to see what Kevin Binkley comes up with next time.  Also I mentioned that we do not eat pork.  The kitchen went out of their way to make sure that we received alternative or modified dishes if pork was involved.  Only once did they forget and bring us a plate with pork on it -- but the waiter realized it before we did and quickly apologized and brought us something else (the vegetarian option that time).  Now thats thoughtful!  Some of the cooler plates were the lava lamp shooters -- a shot glass filled with mint water and small chocolate balls placed on top of a stand that flashes different colored lights up the glass.  Or the small puffed pastry with a minute egg yolk.  Or the beautiful okra flowers with a sweet and hot dipping sauce.  Or the absolutely delectable butternut squash soup (perhaps my favorite).  Or the little piece of fried chicken on my poulet rouge plate (also served with braised leg and a baked breast piece).  Or the apple soup with peanut dust on the rim of the tiny cup it is served in -- we literally watched diners licking the dust off the rim!    I cannot wait to return!  (Also they called me today to make sure we enjoyed our experience -- who does that?!)',5
'This is the type of place I have been waiting to land in Scottsdale Forever!  Lets hope they make it and I hope this town knows what a great place they have on hand here.  I havent ventured outside of the fish tacos on the menu with the exception of the much easier to eat taco mountain but this place delivers on all fronts.  Unassuming great food great staff and even Hawaiian beers on tap.  We were fortunate enough to be there opening weekend when the chef was in from Maui and got the whole scoop on how they procure their fish and all.  Bottom line its a fantastic affordable place with a great vibe and I hope they do very well!',5
'I have been in the office to see DR Khan and have had nothing but great experiences. I have been coming here for the last 2 years  as I am a chronic pain patient. I have seen the staff change from time to time but all very polite and helpful. Dr Khan has been very helpful and active in my treatment and diagnosis and has helped me maintain a pretty productive quality of life despite my diagnosis. He takes the time to listen to my concerns and answers my questions. His office is not for those who do not follow and take their health seriously. He does follow guidelines pretty strictly but coming from a previous office where they handed out pills like candy and were over prescribing patients medication I am glad that he is a guy who is strict in prescribing.  I will continue to go here and advise everyone with legitimate pain who wants to get better to do the same as well.',5
'Yelpers you let me down...  I have been searching for good chinese saw these reviews and decided to check it out. My girlfriend and I were literally the only people in the restaurant at 6pm on a week day. Not a single person came or left the 30 minutes we were there.   I ordered a spicy chicken dish asked no soy to be on it. Waitress confirmed no soy only spicy sauce and it was brought out at a spicy level of 0. Sigh. Half the reason I wanted asian food was for the spice. But I tried to eat it anyway.  However the chicken was like gum. I literally chewed my first piece for about 2 minutes... I wanted to spit it out. Not to mention there were only about 7 pieces of chicken on the entire plate. I took about 5 bites and decided I was done. Ended up driving through taco bell on the way home very irritated.   Also they decided not to turn on the heat when its about 30 degrees outside. It was barely warmer inside than out and all the staff were wearing thick jackets. Just what?... cmon.   Absolutely will not be back.',1
'Love this place. The food is fresh and amazing flavour! I love thai and I have try many rsd tsurants and this one is one of my favorites!  The service is excellent...what else may I say..if you want to try something new or if you are thai crazy or if you like fresh and healthy food.. this is the place!',5
'Excellent taste cookies brownies ice creams. Price is $2 to 3 Mix and match. Yummy',5
'What a great happy hour. We only made it to the bar area but enjoyed the experience.   Drinks and food were outstanding. Atmosphere was warm and pleasant and service was just right - attentive but not annoying.',5
'As an employee of Sprouts for 9 months I am 25 years of age and have worked at Sams Club for 2 years before. Needless to say I know quite a bit about how Costco works as well.  First of all they are a good company to work for with full paid Medical/Dental. (Blue Cross/Blu Shield Metlife) and vacation and even pay for a years worth of bus pass!!!  I can tell you a few secrets about them.  Produce - THEY DONT RE WORK THERE .   PRODUCE. Such a HUGE improvement. example* When you see a fuzzy berry in a bunch...they dont take out that one berry. They throw it away because all of the berrys are tainted with mold. 90% of markets rework there food. They treat all there produce with highest regaurd. Never cutting corners.  MEAT - ITS ALL HARRIS RANCH MEATS!!!! At least for the beef. They get there chicken/fish/pork from the best places around. No big main stream markets around that cut corners. Fyi- I have worked in my past almost every department of Sprouts. My biggest strength is Meat Department. I have also worked every department of Sprouts as well. 95* of the predone meats including the sausage are made in the back. So nice when I got my hands in the meat department. My grandfather was a butcher and remember so much working back there.  COFFEE -  Most places like Sams Club/Costco...the coffee can be up to a year old! A YEAR!  They buy in huge mass bulk and sits in there stock houses and sits. Sprouts coffee is almost never 2 -3 weeks old before they run out and restock.  GROCERY/DAIRY - Pretty much almost the way sprouts works is EVERYTHING is very much healthier for you than MAINSTREAM products. Nuff said PS* I cant find the report on yahoo.com main page but Whole foods is now...after all these years is getting things healthier it was about 3 weeks before I wrote this when it was a main page.  DELI - EVERYTHING IS MADE FRESH AND THERE!!! BOARSHEAD MEATS AND EVERYTHING. Nuff said.  Bottom line....You might pay a bit more for some things but sprouts is still a private company with very very healthy investors. I write this and dont get paid to but I believe in Sprouts. And as getting treated as an employee that isnt in a green shirt Companys great but some managers are not.',5
'For the price in an airport next to getting food pretty quickly this is a decent place to eat. I tried their special big blue burrito and it was okay kind of plain and could of used some spice but other wise it was good for a meal.',4
'It didnt disappoint in the slightest I had the marinated grilled pork and it was delicious. Service was friendly and restaurant was clean (from what I could see). Prices were reasonable.  Ive had bigger burritos at other places but if you prefer quality of quantity this is the place. The burrito I had was enough to fill me up and I didnt leave hungry.',5
'My ex-boyfriend and long-time friend lives in Vegas and has pretty high standards when it comes to dining and entertainment.  My family has all lived in Phx for years but I am a recent transplant from Tucson so when we visited in August I had to rely on the people of Yelp to assist me in discovering new places for a couple of 30 something foodies.  With its central location yummy food and fabulous vibe this spot is now on my list of regular dinner spots. It is a house-turned-restaurant so its not a spot you will just stumble upon.  You have to know where you are headed.  The interior is very tastefully decorated and modern. The chefs are creative and offer new menu choices (including desserts) so you always have something new to try.  Down side is you might not be able to get it next time you come in!',5
'First time here and I will try to remember it is a sports bar and it is a bit close to the burbs for us but Groupon reeled us in.   Just ordered apps (rings and fingers). Atmosphere is definitely sports bar flat screens everywhere.  Live band the night we were there (Fri Aug 19). 15 minutes for appetizers they better be good...  Such a let down.',1
'Try the protein burger! I love this place if you need something fantastic on the go. IN & OUT haha',5
'I came in on a sick day for french toast. Not too busy maybe 9am on a Thursday. It used to be 2 Hippies and I even had their old menu when I got home but it was still good. Nothing spectacular to write home about but worth the trek out of the house and into the realworld all hopped up on cough syrup. French toast was a little dry and the syrup was obviously just incredibly generic but it filled a empty place in my stomach and for 5.00 wasnt bad at all. Would go back for sure.',3
'Not my favorite place in the world I love in and out they by far have the best burgers Lennies burgers is alright but if you really want a real good burger you go to burger bar in Vegas.',1
'I love everything about Essence!  The decor was beautiful the hostess was really nice and the food was absolutely delicious.   I had the Croque Madame sandwich and fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast the other day and its been hard to keep myself from going back every day since.  Not only was the food great but I felt good eating it because all the food is farmed locally.  The price is a little steeper than you might be used to if youre the typical Tempe resident -- for example my sandwich and orange juice were $11 -- but if you like to treat yourself this is the place to do it.',5
'First I was only going to give this store four stars because always being asked for change is annoying.  On second thought I realize this is part of what makes this store click so it is all the way five.  A consumer needs to know some general things about the 99 Cent Only store chain.  They  really have an amazing variety of stock at nothing more than 99 cents. In some cases you will find items for less.  (Try regular or low sodium V 8 juice for 59 cents a can. When I say they have a variety I have purchased everything to computer parts to dvds to cds to tv antennas to alarm clocks to gift bags of all sizes to different things I have used in volunteer work with Ballet AZ.  They always have special items for the current holiday.  The Anderson Split Pea soup that is $1.47 and up at the grocery stores is 99 cents here and they have different varieties.  I never failed to be surprised when I see individual french milled soaps next to bars of lava soap. They have a gourmet section that incudes things I have absolutely no idea of what they are used for but its nice to know they are there if i ever need them?. In season you will find plants that are two dollars less than Bashas has the same size at the time I write this.  I admit to being a shopper so I like just spending time and perusing almost all the shelves.  One of the latest things that really surprised me were boxes of extra large condoms made in colors only!!  Add spice to your sex life in how many different colors?  Now it is time to figures out why this particular store on Indian School is unique and has the drawing power that it does for me.This is an interesting store.  The one on 12 th street that is just about the same distance to my house is bigger and it isnt as crowded.  So why do I shop there more?  Is it because it was there first and I am used to it?  Is it because in this store I have run into people who clearly dont want to be seen shopping there-thats a biggie!  Maybe I just like the real diversity in the people that work and shop there.  Not that often do I get to use the smatterings of different languages I know with people who dont any more English than I know of their tongues.  Trying to make known that you need an alarm clock in Swahili is a challenge.  This store is truly an adventure and I love it!  Its not for the faint of heart.  And as I said before what can be better than listening to the stammering explanation of someone who lives at Scottsdale Ranch and wouldnt  be caught dead in a place like that when you come around a corner and there they are pushing a full shopping cart.  That is as opposed to seeing someone like the dear lady I know who keeps a little winter place at the Biltmore gushing over what terrific buys they have and being glad to see a friend. The only thing I wish they could change about this store would be to have someone there to keep the panhandlers out of the parking lot.  Even that can be interesting at times.  Someone asked me for change the other day and the person looked at what I gave her and she told me that I could do better than that couldnt I?  As she said a dollar really didnt go as far as it did a year ago with the economy the way it is.  Who was I to argue with that line of thinking.  I gave her more and felt good about this budding economist.  One tip about getting to this store that can save you time.  You dont ever want to make a left turn into it or out of it in rush hour traffic.  Talk about having a death wish?  Instead go north in the parking lot and make a left and go across the parking lot pass the Arthur Murray Dance studio and out to 12th st.   There another way to go out north but it takes you through neighborhoods full of people and cars.  I am sharing my secret with you.  It is so much easier this way',5
'Place was ok it was a mediocre sandwich with no veggies other than onion I had the southwest club and a bread bowl of clam chowder which was pretty decent would I go back? probably not',2
'My boyfriend wanted KFC so I took him to this location because it was the one closest to us. Well we went through the drive thru and there was only one car ahead of us we waited 20 minutes until the car in front finally got their food and left. I was a little pissed because we went through the drive thru for a reason for fast service! So when I pulled up to the window This girl (red head) was frantically trying to get our order together and the peoples behind us. I then saw another employee (dark hair) just standing there texting on her cell phone! She was just letting this poor girl handle all the orders and food herself. I think they should fire that girl that was screwing around on her phone because there are plenty of people who need a job and will actually work too. My boyfriend yelled through the window get off your phone and help her but the girl just looked at us walked away and continued to use her damn phone. Not professional at all please fire her.',1
'Busy bar. Friendly vibe. Great margaritas. Definitely recommend the pulled pork chalupa. Consistently good restaurant.',4
'Ive never been to the water park portion so this review is really just for the arcade and mini-golf. Always been a good go-to location for mini-golf. I used to drop in  here when I lived in Gilbert and recently went back while in town. The mini-golf course is the same a little run down but still a fun course a variety of shots and obstacles.  Right now its all decorated for the Holidays. The arcade is in fairly good condition older but well maintained. Service here has always been fast. Prices are affordable $7.50 for adults $6.40 for kids. A good family friendly option in the area.',3
'Ive been looking forward to trying this bakery for a while now and today I finally did.  I expected the cupcakes to be expensive but I was still bowled over by the $3.50 price for a single very average sized cake.  The selection was pretty good - everything from the standard chocolate and red velvet to peanut butter and cherry.  I asked the woman at the counter for her recommendation and she said everyone seems to love the red velvet but her personal favorite was the Tropical Vacation which had coconut and a pineapple filling.  I purchased my cupcake and took it back to the office with me to enjoy.  I was impressed by the packaging and I suspect thats where the bulk of my $3.50 (plus tax) went.  The plan white cube had an interior cupcake tray so the cupcake wouldnt go sloshing around.  It was a nice touch.  I just finished eating my afternoon treat and here are my thoughts:  - Average size - Heavy but thats due to the huge amount of very heavy frosting - The consistency of the cake was very nice - not dry not too dense just right - The coconut flakes in the cake itself was a very nice and unexpected treat. - I expected the cake to be coconut flavored but it wasnt - it was just a white cake. - The pineapple filling had absolutely no flavor aside from sweet - Way too much frosting.  The sugar overpowered whatever little bit of flavor the cake or filling may have provided. - The frosting itself was way too dense.  I was able to pick it up and break off a piece without it getting messy or falling apart.  I really really wanted to love Cupcakes by Design and would have gladly paid $3.50 for a really spectacular cupcake especially when the flavor selection is really unique but I cant imagine Ill ever go back unless their prices drop by a couple bucks.',2
'Great food and very well priced for the portions.  We tried the spring rolls green curry with chicken and pad see ew w/ Beef.  All were some of the best Ive had in years and certainly some of the best in the valley.     Update:  Weve been back here at least 10 times and its always great.   The north scottsdale location however isnt as good get to the shea location.',5
'A favorite of mine. Probably the one restaurant that Ive been to the most in the 10 years Ive been here in Phoenix. Love the Mexican Short Stack.',5
'wow time to debunk these incorrect reviews. 1.  I saw Harry Potter in the 21+ STAR CLASS theater.  the aisles were amazing.  each row had 3 seats-space-4 seats space then 2 seats.  this way if you can have your own row in a group of 2 3 or 4!! wow! I have never seen a theater like this before.   I saw Harry Potter with no kids for the 1st time ever WOW what a difference it made!! great food and drink service right from our seats. the extra aisles made it so the servers never blocked the screen.  what a great idea and the ticket was only $9 +$2 service charge which was worth a FREE POPCORN so..its the same price as other places.  2. you CAN reserve seats online just not yet. its a new theater and that system isnt up yet.  it had nothing to do with how many people ordered online. I talked with the manager.  3. very friendly service and the ticket taker told me which theater and where the restrooms were located.  4. food service was continuous from the moment we got into the auditorium.  there are different setups.  the STAR CLASS theater has the seating arrangements to accommodate ordering from the seats.  If you want beer brought to you during a move go to star class.  5.  movie had 3 or 4 previews like any movie Id ever been to.  6. the seats will break in as time goes on.  theyre supposed to be a little stiff the first few months.  wow what a great experience.  1 more thing.. I bought 4 tickets online by mistake and wanted 3. I showed up to the box office (3 days before the show) told them my mistake and they said no problem and gave me a cash refund (even though it clearly states no refunds on internet orders)  great customer service great STAR CLASS experience worth the extra $2 (but had free popcorn remember) amazing food for a movie theater. next time Ill try the motion seats :)',5
'Good food',4
'Oh Someburros...you are better in my memory than in real life...but Oh what memories.... When I was in high school and lived in AZ my best friends and I would get Someburros all the time...it was where the entire universe was discussed and unfolded. Sometimes we would just get chips and salsa to go but being there was better. Recently I had Someburros on a trip to Phoenix and was able to introduce my husband and baby to the joy that is Someburros. Not much has changed. I still love their salsa which is really an amazing hot sauce. See...as soon as I get back to MN I dream about it! Things I love include the cheese enchiladas the chicken burrito and more recently the chicken burrito with jalepeno cream cheese. But really its all good. And cheap. And a thousand times better for your memory and well-being than Taco Bell.',4
'Went here for a co-workers birthday today. I dont eat meat and dont care for BBQ so I ordered the portobello mushroom sandwhich with southwest veggies on the side. The sandwhich wasnt bad just didnt wow me. Not really seasoned at all I feel like it should have had some type of marinade on it or something. The veggies were steamed and healthy which I liked.   Some of my coworkers ordered the salmon salad which looked amazing and I tried a piece of the jalapeno corn bread which was delicious.',3
'Pretty cool but my friend derek lives here and hes an asshole so 2 stars for letting his pos ass live here',2
'After reading reviews here on yelp and hearing from a few friends that Lolos is awesome I was so excited to eat there.  I think I may have had expectations that were too high..... but I really wasnt too impressed. My chicken was kind of dry the mac and cheese was a little bland and I cant really complain about the collards I think they just arent my thing. The waffles were pretty good though (getting them with pecans is tasty). Overall the food was ok and I did love the cool-aid but prices were high for just one piece of chicken and a waffle.',3
'Absolutely a storybook wedding!  My daughter had her wedding at The Castle and I have to say from our initial consultation to the minute she and her new husband drove away in their limo it was a fabulous experience.   The wedding consultant was very knowledgeable and offered terrific ideas and special touches to create the most beautiful wedding Ive ever attended. She coordinated everything with meticulous attention to detail. I know everyone says theres always a glitch at the last minute but everything went smoothly. From the beautiful flower arrangements to an amazing catering job we were impressed.     They recommended a great band and we had most of the 250 guests on the floor at some point. It was so fun!  The grounds are beautiful and The Castle offers a rich ambiance that made her wedding seem a little like a fairytale affair.  I will never forget the thoughtfulness of the staff their impeccable communication and their attention to all the details. They had a can-do attitude throughout the planning process and the wedding itself.  Our wedding consultant was on-site throughout the wedding just to be sure things went smoothly.  In addition to it being a beautiful organized venue it was a value.  I highly recommend The Castle for any couple who wants their wedding to have a little magic in it.',5
'the Pho bo vien is sooo sooo yummy and the spring roll are so die for. great prices and friendly staff.',5
'The sushi here is outstanding and the sushi chefs know what they are doing. They prepare everything fresh and the happy hour menu is a big plus.  Outside of the chefs service is lousy. The host staff spends its time flirting with customers and ignoring the common man and they go out of their way to butter up to the more glitzy customers who dress for success and if you dont fit their image of the Biltmore you are out of luck.  Stick with sitting at the sushi bar and directly relating to the chefs and you should have no problems',4
'Either you love the place and go back or you really just dont like it.  Seriously.  The place was recommended to me by a girl I worked with who practically grew up in the Asian restaurants in the east valley Wongs included.  After I went there the first time I took my boyfriend there two days later - I liked it that much!  Then I recommended it to a close friend who loves it as well.  The food was tasty the servers are always friendly to me - though the older gentleman who works there can be a bit gruff - and I never want for a drink as my cup is always full.  Ive had Chinese food in other cities - and no its hard to compare with some place like San Fransisco.  Chinese food is better there from my experience but the greater Phoenix area isnt known for being a foodie mecca like SF or NY.  None the less its a good meal and is on our list of staple go-out places.  The things I generally get there are the beef with oyster sauce moo shu chicken or mongolian beef.  My boyfriend likes a variety of other things - but we both love the sizzling rice soup.  Its awesome.  Ultimately Chinese is a pretty subjective food more so than alot of other cuisine.  Everyone has a specific taste set for it in their palates it seems so give it a try for yourself.',4
'This place is awesome! I just wish I had the money to do my shopping here. I do come here whenever I cant get something at my normal supermarket I know theyll have it here and I havent been disappointed yet. I especially like that they sell a lot of items in bulk (dried fruits grains rice lentil etc) So I can just get what I need and I dont need to pay for a whole package which sometimes makes it cheaper than a less expensive store if youre looking for something specific for one recipe.   Also the smoothie bar is super good! I love the tropical green smoothie... I could drink one everyday except they cost 5$ so I really cant... but I would. One day when I make lots of money (ha) Ill do all of my shopping here.',4
'WOW! This place is awesome! My girlfriends and I came to Atlas Bistro on a Saturday night and we couldnt stop talking about how amazing it was. The food was delicious. Seriously some of the best food Ive ever had. The atmosphere was quaint and fun and the service was terrific. I loved the somewhat unique dishes. They were different than your normal menu but not so different that you didnt really want to try much. They also accommodated the various allergies at our table of 9 lades. I just wish I had taken a to-go bag of my scallops!',5
'they are open late and thats the one thing that sets them apart from any of the other coffee places i go to. ill stick with gold bar or even coffee rush if its during normal hours tho..',3
'We have been here a few times. It is inconsistent thus the three stars. I think sitting amongst the trees and out of the stucco is the finest feature of Joes Farm Grill. It is fun to watch the children scampering about. Oh yeah the food. ... Sometimes dry sometimes burned sometimes delicious always pricey.  Wouldnt recommend for out of town visitors. They are not as impressed with trees and quasi secluded suburbs.',3

'Gave them a try the other day when driving by and wanting a smoothie. Tried the Rockin Raspberry. Thought it was very good and a reasonable price.  I also tried a flat bread at another visit. It was okay. If I wanted a smoothie and didnt want to stop somewhere else to eat but didnt find the flatbread worth going there just for that. The smoothies are great though and a bread price.',5

'I really enjoyed this little cafe nestled between Sens and The Turf on 1st St downtown.  Had a yummy Cobb Salad and a side of Sweet Potato french fries for lunch.  I just wish they served the french fries with an interesting sauce (maybe ailoli).  The salad came with along with a chocolate chip cookie for dessert.   The place has great atmosphere (small and quaint).  They have free parking in the back.  Too bad they arent open for dinner :(',4
'This place is overpriced has bad customer service and under cooks its Hot Wings. The pizza I had was mediocre at best!',3
'Great summer time specials!  Staff was super helpful when my car malfunctioned and locked the keys inside.  Walking distance to everything - restaurants bars... we never walked more than a few hundred feet!',4
'Ra is a great place to go if youre looking for a party-atmosphere to hang out with friends and have some sake. But be warned if youre in the mood for authentic and fresh sushi and a relaxing atmosphere this is not the place.  The patio during the cooler months is quieter and more enjoyable (and is a decent place to people-watch on weekend nights). They have a great bar if youre looking to socialize and have a few cocktails during happy hour.   The special rolls are good. I love their Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll and their Ahi Tuna is good. However the seafood is not as fresh as it could be. The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.   When youre traveling and dont know any local sushi joints Ra is a reliable chain to go to.',2
'If your looking for a fabulous place to have some coffee meet with friends waste some time or grab a bite to eat Lux is the place. This local coffee shop is better than any chain coffee place.  Walk into this place and you will know why.  The atmosphere is a place where you can grab a seat on a couch and relax and enjoy your coffee or meal.  This is a great place to bring a lap top and do some work or play. This is a place that you could visit any time of the day or night.  Reminds me of a little coffee shop in downtown Denver that I used to visit.   The coffee is delicious and they have delicious pastries if you like. The only reason I give this a four star is they dont offer a Thai iced tea. :(',4
'I hope you enjoy this restaurant as much as I did!  Ive had Mexican Food in the best restaurants in Mexico City & hands down Padres lives up to its reputation of being one of the best Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. The food is spicy but not so hot that you have to drink gallons of libations just to put the fire out... Although every one boasts about their Margaritas I tried out the Sangria it was so good that I had ordered a second...  I will definitely go back!',5

'I live this location because there is not a crazy line on Saturday mornings and they brew their iced coffee to perfection. As a former sbux employee I can taste that some other locations dont know how to brew it correctly because it tastes watery :/',5
'Coming from TX we know Rudys. But have to say the Chandler location was even better than those in Houston. Not an avid fan but was definitely better.  Line was ridiculous to get in my guess something knew = novelty. People were nice outside area was quiet and spacious.   Food = we sampled the brisket and we ordered the pulled pork. Definitely agree with the reviews very peppery on the pork but not fatty. Would get the brisket if we go back. My husband and our friends got the loaded baked potato with meat on top they rated it better than Joes BBQ which says a lot.   I just had the 1/2 lb pork in a tub. Why only 3 stars? Not a fan of the sauce and without it meat was just ok. Is more vingary and peppery than sweet. Would I get to go or go back again probably but bring my own sause. And had to add more sugar to the sweet tea. Nix on the coleslaw - no taste.  Overall good not stellar but good. TX Roadhouse still has the best pulled pork around if you like it sweet.',3
'Dr. Carr at Warner Vista Animal Hospital in Gilbert and his staff are the most wonderful and compassionate veterinarian staff I have ever known.   We lost our precious Tucker on Saturday. Things happened quickly and we didnt have much time to prepare. As we held Tucker and said goodby Doc Carr not only made us as comfortable as possible but he cried right along with us. You see he too had fallen under the spell of that furry little wonder dog.  We had not thought to get his paw print before we left home and were slightly upset with ourselves. Guess what we got in the sympathy card from his staff today? Yep. They had made green (as in grass) prints for us. Little things like that mean so much. Thank you Dr. Carr. (And staff)',5
'Since I moved from San Francisco I still miss Nijiya Marukai Mitsuwa and Chinese markets.  Not enough Asian population in AZ so it is very difficult to find a fresh Asian groceries.  I drive 26 miles from Avondale to come shopping at least once a month.  They carry fresh produce.  I need to be careful about expiration date on certain things like fish cakes.  Im not sure they check dates and keep eveything fresh.',3
'I stayed here for a business conference this week and was impressed with this hotel.    The staff here is incredible. Everyone was very friendly on point and went out of their way to be helpful and to make us feel comfortable. Its also pet friendly   The rooms are newer large tastefully appointed and full of amenities. Wifi is fairly quick and it is included in the nightly rate... (Also no hidden resort fees here!) My complaints about the room are few... They have HD TVs in the rooms but the signal is analog and the mattress was starting to show some age (with wallows or ruts in other words).   My main issue is that this hotel is one that still offers smoking rooms. We could smell the smoke from these rooms in the halls and it even found its way into our room through the cracks in the door. Non-smokers will NOT be happy if youre room ends up next to a smoker.  The public facilities are numerous and great with the standout being a nice lobby bar stocked with some better names in wine and liquor especially tequila and big new HD TVs for watching a game. We ate at the onsite SWB restaurant and tried their Wine me Dine me dinner which was fantastic and a real treat (see separate review for more). The meeting facilities are top notch and the grounds are very nice.  The pool area is currently being renovated with only the former adults pool now open and Im hoping its going to be renovated as well since the stone flooring under the lounge chairs is filthy looking dated and in serious need of a deep cleaning. The pool bar is also woefully lacking in premium beverage choices. Our server was happy to go get what we wanted from the lobby bar but I didnt ask her to go to that trouble  Overall the Hyatt RSRS @ GR is a great place to have a conference or to just relax and unwind. Its not perfect but its a solid pick',4
'My wife and I heard this place was better than another high class restaurant that will go unnamed from a professional chef.  He claimed the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked.  Also that in addition to the steak at the Salt Cellar you get two sides.  So you get better value and better tasting food for the same price!  I like a good steak.  I picked the ribeye (one of my most favorite cuts) and waiting in anxious anticipation.  I had high expectations and was very excited.  My wife ordered the stuffed lobster and we waited.  The atmosphere was nice.  The furniture could use updating but everything was clean.  Our waiter was very nice and helpful.  When the food came it looked wonderful.  However the steak was tough.  It tasted good but it was very chewy.  While it looked to be cooked to my liking I expected it to be easier to chew and swallow.  My wife was very pleased with her lobster.  She raved over it and would probably give a 4-5 star review.  The service was the redeeming factor for the Salt Cellar.  But for that youd be looking at 1-2 stars.',3
'Ok Im going to start with 3 stars.   I decided I needed a breakfast beer this morning.........not to early..... so I gave jimbos  a whirl its located in the old vine tavern bldg on main and recker  basically its the vine under new ownership I had wings sold by the pound $6.99 a bit pricey but tastes were good I also brought home the tuna stuffed tomato salad for the wife which was decent lettuce straight out of the bag and some of the lettuce was a bit wilty again not bad but a bit pricy $8.99 on a better. Note they actually had a good selection of beer on 3 different taps from four peaksshock top and the usual domestics I will go back to give a few other things on the menu a try .....the menu is extensive',3
'Ive been to this kohls a thousand times in the past fours years my family and I have spent quite a bit shopping here and always had a great experience. That is until tonight I had to return quite a few items and the young man in charge of this was quite unpleasant. Now I understand if youre having a bad day but he was just plain rude. We are loyal customers and its a shame when one bad apple ruins youre shopping experience.',2
'My family and I have been faithful frequent patrons of this place for 6 1/2 years.  We appreciated the service food and prices.  However things have changed for the worse!  On our last few visits the portion sizes have been consistently shrinking.  I suspect sub-standard ingredients in use as well.  Such a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!  After all this time I can no longer count on my expectations being fulfilled.  I feel so CHEATED!  I would much rather see a fair price increase than have to search for a new favorite spot.',2
'I love this place. Every time I visit I come here. I did miss out of Bucket of Crab night :(',5
'Upon first moving here 2 years ago I had the worse experience attempting to get an airbrush spray tan at this salon. They had only 2 people at specific times that could spray you custom. No problem showed up and the tech could not figure out how to use the gun. So awkward enough him being a male and standing there naked I oopted to get my money back after waiting 20 min.  Well a couple months back they ran a deal for Versa Which is a booth spray tan. I love this booth..it is like airbrushing but private and this spray tan absolutely does not smell or stain your sheets! I found this upon leaving Denver CO. and just fogot until I saw it online oneday on living deals for Amazon.:) one down two to go..all for $29 :) love!  As far as the gym goes never used it!',5
'The bulk items here are really the only consistently priced items in the entire store. They do have some occasional good deals.... for example.... milk right now is only 1.57..... but other than those occasional sale items there are really no good deals here. I highly recommend going late at night.....otherwise you will have to wait in very long lines....and the prices are not worth it. One other important note here...if you shop with a credit card.....dont bring it here....they dont except them. Eat Drink and be Merry my Friends....but do your grocery shopping somewhere else!!!!',2
'I love Ocean Club! We have eaten here many times as we live very close. The service is attentive and what should be expected from a fine dining restaurant. I swear I could just live off the pretzel bread and butter cake! They have an extensive wine list and their cocktails are also very generous portions. The lobster mashed potatoes are delicious and last time I was here I had the big eye tuna which was cooked to perfection! Love love love this restaurant!',5
'I go here most Saturdays.  Ive started walking with the guys from the 100 Mile Club at 7:00 on Saturday morning.  I go to Royal with a friend afterwards for coffee.  I have no complaints about the coffee.  Today I ordered a chocolate chip cookie to go with my coffee though and I didnt even finish it.  It was too cake-y.  The service is fast and the atmosphere is urban and hip.  The patrons are interesting; the people-watching cant be beat!',3
'What is this a club a music dive a strip club or a porn house???  I have heard interesting rumors about this place that they shoot porn somewhere in this club. I guess its a multifunction business and serves many purposes. When you enter you are launched in world of scantily clad dancers on the bar and misters blasting soft clouds of wate vapor into the air. Between the guy blowing fire from his mouth on the bar and the numerous dancers it was dangerous to even buy a drink. I decide to go between the the dancers and duck the flaming bartender to get something to ease my mind.  Do I dare ask what type of beer do you have? Unfortunately  they have shit for selection I am reduced to Heineken. Defeated again!   We actually came here to see our friends band play so we entered the second area of this bar and was thrust into a pseudo lounge dive thing which almost felt like a Hotel conference room.  It had this weird winding stair case leading to the third area of this joint. Hmm I thought that has to be where they shoot the pornos. My friend I figured it was a special coke party since everyone who came back up was sniffing and rubbing their noses.  After watching people descend and reappear from this staircase My buddy decides to check it out. He reports back later in the night it was simple a really bad DJ spinning records who he thought may have been partially retarded. So much for the porn and coke party that is so 80s anyway.  The music was good both bands Talk Fiction and 9th Street Shakedown were entertaining. Overall this place isnt that cool besides being completely random and in between a giant Coca-Cola Bottling Facility and other industrial like buildings its nothing to check out.  I guess the only coke floating around this joint is the soft drink type.    Even though I wouldnt return to Phase 54 I am still convinced they shoot porno here that cant be taken away from me!  I forgot to mention the entire time The Adventures of Baron Munchausen  was playing on this huge flat screen TV. Not only did it distract all of us watching the bands later on my guitarist buddy from Talk Fiction said I had a hard time concentrating I kept trying to watch Baron Munchausen during our set its one of my favorite movies.   Totally Random.....',3
'I still love Grimaldis pizza but some of their staff could definitely use an attitude check.  We last went during off hours and the restaurant was relatively empty.  We were seated at a small 4-top in the middle of the room.  When we asked if we could sit at one of the empty tables by the window the hostess told us no since we were a party of 4 and those tables were for 5.  Seriously?  All of the tables are empty.  Were talking one extra chair.  So of course when we ordered two pizzas and an appetizer there was a space problem for the server.  As we were leaving the hostess was advising another family they couldnt bring their stroller in because there wasnt enough space.  While that might hold true during busy times there was plenty of space.  I can only assume this employee was working under managements policies.  Aside from that I still think they have some of the best pizza around although we have gotten a soggy middle a few times since our first visit.',4
'What a delicious haven in phoenix. watermelon agua fresca was perfect. the chicharron de queso was delicious its a huge grilled/fried piece of cheese. their tacos are absolutly perfect. the grilled veggies quac and salas. mostly local and organic huge board on the wall saying where all their food comes from.',5
'Came in for lunch with friends and my 2 little girls.   Ordered 3 short rib tacos.   However I only ate 2 since one of my friends was like I can believe you didnt order a burger.  As a result I didnt eat the 3 rd taco and got up and ordered a Burger.  Im happy I did.  It was flat out fantastic and Im a stickler for a good burger.  Not that the short rib taco was great.   I could of easily ate all 3 as they were great too.   Next time I go in there Im ordering a burger and 1 short rib taco.    This place is fantastic and a wonderful bang for the buck.     Dont miss out on the shake either (which i ordered for my little girls).   I almost sucked all theirs down.   One of the best chocolate shakes ever.   Next time you are in the area drop in to The Stand and give it a try.   Nothing fancy but no need to be.   They know what they are doing with the few items on the menu.    I could see them throwing in a special every now and then to mix things up or too try something different .   Overall   this  place is a great place to eat.',5
'I was excited about the prospect of PastaBAR - hipster Italian dining in downtown PHX. Unfortunately I forgot that too often hipster is synonymous with pretentious.  I thought I liked the ambiance of the place until I found out that supposedly the paintings on the wall are of serial killers.  If thats true its laughably stupid. The service was OK not overly helpful as we already to look up several things on the menu since it made no sense to us non-foodies. And I understand that we get overserved in America and portions should normally be smaller but for what we got versus what it cost I felt slighted.  And it wasnt that tasty either.  So Meh PastaBAR.  You have promise but youre executed with an attitude that apparently just isnt for me. Maybe Ill try again if you decide to serve some of those evil carbs in the form of actual bread.',2
'Ordered a large pie for carry out took less than 20 minutes.  Service was great.  I love the crust because its got a little chew to it and it was thin and crisp.  I would go again try the dine in menu. I loved what I ordered pepperoni sausage with extra cheese.',4
'Silver mine is reliable which gives it extra brownie points. They deliver until 3am! Especially for those of us who work late get home late dont want to cook so we get delivery.  My two favorite subs are the Frontier and the Silver Plume. I think its a unique idea to theme a sandwich place after a silver mine. The guys that work there are really laid back and try to be as helpful and accommodating as possible but they are getting 4 out of 5 stars because their menu is literally just sandwiches and drinks.',4
'Run of the mill Walmart. Bad service lacking in open registers long lines that take forever rude customers but the shelves are decently stocked with what I need when I go. Would much rather be at Target but the good deals and location being so close to home is hard to beat.',2
'I finally went to try out the new neighborhood sushi joint.  I had lunch at Iron Chef and must say that it was simply a delicious lunch done right!  I tried an assortment of sushi and sashimi including the surf clam (which is always a great way to measure freshness) the shrimp tempura sashimi eel  shrimp and salmon.    The fish is fresh and prepared with a modern twist.  The entire lunch was provided to me on one large plate which made it easier to eat as well as simpler to sample each variety of sushi without having to move plates around the table.   The interior was carried over from Pick Up Stix the previous tenant - it a small dining area without too much room to dine.  I was able to eat outside which I prefer until the heat comes scorching in.  The service is good not great.  Expect to wait for at least 15 minutes for your food.  However it is worth the wait.   Iron Chef also offers an all you can eat sushi buffet half off happy hour and a Chinese menu.  A great option for most any time.',4
'I have been going to WOB for a few months now. I might even consider myself a regular there at this point.  What hooked me about WOB is the extensive beer knowledge that the servers and bartenders have.  There are lots of places in Tempe with good beer but very few places where the staff know beer as well as they do at WOB.  By the second time going there the bartender remembered me and recommended excellent beers according to my tastes.  Rachel the bartender with the purple hair particularly stands out in her level of beer knowledge and exceptional customer service.  Every time I go there she takes time to make sure that Im taken care of and even if Im not in her section she always comes by to make sure Im doing ok and to recommend beer to me she believes Ill enjoy based on her memory of my beer preferences.  Brandon and Hannah are two more WOB staff who stand out in their exceptional customer service and beer knowledge.  The beer selection at WOB is truly impressive and ever changing which makes going there once a week a true beer adventure!  I especially enjoy the tap events sponsored by local breweries during which I can taste beers that are available no where else.  The addition of food to their wares is very welcome.  The food is delicious presented very well and is served very quickly.  And for you vegetarian beer drinkers out there their vegetarian flatbread is divine!',5
'Great food and ambiance - cant wait to go back',4
'Scottsdales Best Breakfast Restuarant! Im in here 2-3 times a week. Service is great! Food is out and ready within 5-10 minutes after ordering. Also they have one of the healthiest breaskfast menues in Scottsdale. I highly recommend the Protein & Iron for breakfast. Added plus its right next to Starbucks for your morning coffee.',5
'My 2 cents: WTF kind of mexican place does not serve salsa?    We met a group of 10 here for a bday dinner/ drinks patio thing on a Saturday night.  I was looking forward to trying it after looking at the menu online.  I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.  We had a few apps guac that was nice but not better than Gallo Blanco or the Mission and a few quesadillas.  When I flagged down our server to ask for salsa with our aracherra quesadilla she looked apologetic as she explained that they do not serve salsa just Tapatio in the bottle.  Excuse me?  Its like the chefs saying a big F You! my food is so good it doesnt need salsa.  I can assure you though it was definitely lacking some flavor that a well executed salsa or two could have provided.  I felt cheated.  I will go to a place based on their salsa appeal alone.  Its a crime akin to a sushi restaurant saying they do not serve soy sauce it just doesnt make sense.    The service could have been a little better but it was a Saturday night and we were a big group keeping them busy with cocktail orders so it was forgivable.  I did ask for the consolation prize Tapatio which never came.  Although I am admittedly salsa obsessed even others in my party commented on how weird the salsa prohibition was.  Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos he thought they were dry and were definitely missing something in there.  Four tacos also came out on one plate with no side plates even though two different gentleman ordered them.  When we asked the food runner about it he said everything was family style.  You know how dudes are with their food especially when you are sitting at opposing ends of the table and dont really know each other family style well.  I teased my friend seated next to me that I hoped other dude washed his hands before handling his tacos in the family style melee but I digress.    The highlight of the experience was the Michelada I ordered with Modelo Especial which was made perfectly.  Probably one of the best I have ever had.  I ordered a second one and this is definitely something I could envision myself coming back for maybe during happy hour.  I know we didnt try any of the more complex dinner items but really - I just cant get past the salsa ban so I doubt I will in the future.',2
'Really enjoyed my meal and experience here. Had a Margarita and the Chicken Chimichanga both were great. Service was perfect and the spicy green salsa was terrific.',5
'This is a lovely place. The staff superb and room service prices perfect and no guilt indulgence for a few days off. My only complain was I could never find a closet to hang my cloth...I dont think there was one. If going on a bussines trip call ahead and ask if they have a closet or somewhere to hang your cloth. Make sure to have a car because is not close to the mall or restaurants. Still and incredible getaway and perfect view of the golf course.',4
'Good food realy bad service',2
'So much going on at this farm and its really great to visit and pick your own fruit when its in season! Great for all ages.  Its right across the street from the Queen Creek Olive Mill so its great to tour both in one day get a feel for quality local businesses.',5

'Great bank with great service and very friendly staff.',5
'My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in AZ. I recommend this restaurant to all of my friends & family. Quality food clean atmosphere & very friendly staff. Their soups are the best & its authentic vietnamese food. Try their Bun Rieu or their Crispy noodle cake (S2) Love Love Love. Everything Ive had here is quite tasty. Enjoy!!!',5
'I use the swimming pool here when our heated outdoor pool is being maintained.  Management was easy-going and friendly both times Ive gone to retrieve the pool key (last year and this year around the same time-frame).  However the gates lock is always a hassle to unlock.  Both times Ive let management know that the key or lock needs to be replaced.    The pool is irregular in shape so its hard to get a decent exercise.  I finally opted to just swim the perimeter.  (The pool at the complex I live in is geometric but there is a straight path that allows for sufficient laps.)  Miramontes pool is very deep (about 8 feet) in most areas so what it lacks in distance it makes up in endurance-- I find it harder to swim with that much more water underneath.    On my first time swimming there last week (Wed) the water temperature was almost as hot as that of their jacuzzi!  Its a good thing I didnt have much time to swim or I probably wouldve had a worse headache than I ended up with when I finally surfaced.  I didnt have time to stop at the office to file a complaint but I did mention it the following morning to personnel at the complex I live in and by Friday the water temperature was back to normal temperatures which is around 82 degrees F at my complexs pool.  I thought that was fantastic to have that one issue addressed right away.  :))  Thank you btw to the young man with the great smile who assisted me that first day in opening the gate for me!  I very much appreciated your help!  :)',3
'The watch battery prices are a tad high yet they guarantee them for 5 years AND track it in their computer system.  Ive had countless watch batteries replaced under the warranty without so much as a hitch - so convenient and theyre QUICK!  In the long run it has saved me time and money plus its convenient because they do it while Im shopping anyway.  They clean my rings while I wait too.  Their estate jewelry is fun and often 50% off.  I get that I can use a razor blade to pop the back of my watches to replace my own battery but I dont want to risk scratching them.  The staff are usually friendly too.  Downside:  sometimes theres a bit of a line.',3
'A tip of the hat to their creativity  effort to source locally passion for quality and engaging customer service.  Also all the other superlatives that were repeated ad nasuem in the other reviews.    I also like that this place is literally just down the street from the Cold Stone Creamery headquarters.  I wonder how often they have their corporate spies in there.',4
'it is goodwill.. u know what to expect =)',2
'A few of my friends asked me to tag along to Konas happy hour and Im so glad I did. They have margaritas and cosmos for $5 and the Philly roll is included on the list (when it never is). I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fabulous happy hour.',4
'Ive traveled the west coast and parts of the east coast finding and trying fry bread and Ive gotta tell you this is the best of the best!  Most fry bread at other places is of an entirely different consistency but at the Fry Bread House their bread is PERFECT! It goes well by itself with a soup or even topped with something to make for a delicious dessert!  The few times Ive been there Ive also ordered the hominy soup which is very delicious to eat along with the fry bread.  I highly recommend those two together.  As for the dessert (the offer a variety of toppings for the fry bread Ive had the honey and sugar and the chocolate) Both are good but the honey and sugar is a bit messy so be prepared for that. The chocolate is also a bit messy. The different toppings add a bit more sweetness to the fry bread but honestly I find it best when served warm without any toppings at all.  Definitely worth a try!',5
'This is no In n Out Burger. The menu is pretty extensive the burgers are okay and the service is great (which is why they get a three). I will be back again and update if I find something better but this time was nothing to write home about. Those that say Culvers is better than In n Out must be out of their minds!',3
'I am a sushi connoisseur and was very impressed with Nori Sushi.  Sushi was super fresh and delicious even the rice was perfect.  Nori had some creative rolls as well.  Takana Trio Roll I tried had great blend of crisp flavors without it being over powered by rich sauce.  Great service and cool atmosphere.  Will definitely be back next time in the area.',5
'Youre still in denial. Three arrests in the last six months a family intervention... a failed suicide attempt  and a short stint in rehab. (hospital not Hard Rock). Theres only one sure way to drop this meth habit for good. Taser.  Yes Taser delivers its own unique brand of intervention with over 50000 volts of reality and for free no less.

I havent tried Taser yet but have several friends on the Phoenix police department whove helped change many lives. In some cases for good.   Taser totally rocks.',5
'Although I have stayed in fine hotels on five continents my favorite hotel except for the Hotel Monasterio Cusco Peru is Camelback Inn set in the Sonoran desert among saguaro and palo verde between Mummy Mountain and Camelback Mountain.  When you arrive at the Camelback Inn courtyard beautiful with desert flowers fountain and saguaro friendly staff at the Bell House dressed in khaki shorts and white shirts greet you with smiles and warm welcome ready to help and drive you in a golf cart to your casita.  The courteous staff remember you show friendly interest wanting you to enjoy your stay.  I love the authentic Southwestern experience and beautiful desert setting of historic Camelback Inn preferring it to more opulent Scottsdale hotel-resorts.  Built in 1936 on 125 desert acres the pueblo casita style and the hacienda style entry and lobby containing stunning Western sculptures express early Southwestern and Native American culture.  Gorgeous mountain views of close-by majestic purple-pink Camelback Mountain rise against the lush desert valley.  Reason enough to come to Camelback Inn is the beautiful indoor/outdoor patio setting of Ritas Kitchen restaurant set against Mummy Mountain.  Outdoor tables and chairs with mountain views are surrounded by gardens of desert flowers saguaro and palm trees flaming fire pit and cool pools.  Mostly friendly servers one refused to give me an open unreserved table bring delicious food with a Southwestern flavor or tasty salads with fresh ingredients.  Camelback Inn serves the best most delicious Sunday brunch in the Scottsdale Phoenix area.  The casita rooms are spacious comfortable and open to a balcony or small patio.  Lovely linens billowy pillows and wonderfully comfortable bed enhance your stay.  A call to the Bell House brings a friendly driver in golf cart to your casita eager to drive you to the lobby or restaurants to swimming pool or spa.  More fun is to walk paths lined with bougainvillea and beautiful desert landscaping.  As a child before I moved away I rode horseback with friends through this desert seeing the adobe casitas of Camelback Inn in the then still open desert never imagining I would one day return as a guest.',4
'I recently got an update from a local Yelper that this joint just closed.  I think it had something to do with a late rent payment dispute with the landlord.  Stay tuned....',3
'I purchased a washer and gas dryer from Lowes. Originally the sales rep said there would be no installation charge but by the time I reached the cash register that changed because they claimed a gas dryer installation costs extra.  So I paid $153.00 for the gas dryer installation.  I live in a new construction house.  When the installer arrived he claimed that the existing gas hookup was not standard and that it would cost an additional $100 for the install and that they would have to come back another time.  I spoke with Lowes and they supported this claim.  I told them that I wanted a refund for the $153.00 and that I would call a plumber myself.  They said that it would cost me more than $253 for the install if I used my own plumber but refunded my money anyway.  A plumber came out and installed the dryer for $85.00.  Not sure if this were an intentional bait and switch but I saved myself $168.00 by not taking Lowes word for it...',1
'best hawaiian food in az thus far! def order the short ribs with a hawaiian iced tea! food is consistently delish!! cash only! very busy- as most of the people who eat there are ASU students!! mmmm...im craving some just talking about it.',5

'Looks suspect however had good reviews so we are checking it out... Food was subpar there is a reason why the food is cheap....',2
'What a cool place! Loved the outdoor patio around the duckpond. We sat inside for some AC as today was a little toasty. I got a corona light and my husband and friend were giving thumbs up about the margaritas. Their chips and salsa actually comes with three salsas: mild med and hot. All three were pretty tasty!  We ordered the green chile tamales and the fish tacos which came with rice and black beans. The tamales were great-two to an order and big! The fish tacos were not the best Ive ever had-but not bad either. Pretty standard fare. Although the sauce on top was pretty good.  Service was prompt although I dont think our waiter smiled once. I did like the layout of the place though. Even though we sat inside we were right by a large glass wall overlooking the duck pond.',3
'This is a great Asian buffet. I dont come to places like this expecting haute cuisine and I didnt find it. However I was surprised at the variety of entrees and by how fresh everything looked and tasted. The best time to go is during the week for lunch. The buffet is $8.99 and you get unlimited sushi made to order by a sushi chef build-your-own Mongolian stir fry and six buffet stations of various Asian dishes. I love Asian noodles and their three varieties were delicious. I especially loved the duck noodles. Dont leave without trying the green beans.  Additionally you can observe the Native Phoenician in his natural habitat. Marvel as the gargantuan beast waddles toward the buffet line with two plates in each hand. Legend says that a Phoenician can eat three times his own body weight in one sitting. This is a great place to test the theory.',5
'Love coming here every time I get to Phoenix.  Great New Mexican food in this little gastropub.  Dinner or breakfast on the weekend is awesome.  Big portions and even bigger flavor.  Finding it with no sign out front is the key.',5

'Its a small sushi place but you can get Chinese and Sushi if you are with a person who doesnt like sushi.  On the Chinese side that have all the familiar suspects.  We opted for the beef with broccoli which was delish.  I had the $25 all you can eat sushi and its a great deal.  We would go again.  Not too shabby either.',4
'Stopped in for lunch today to this the smallest Mexican restaurant in the world except for Taco Bite!  This La Canasta (of many & much variation) seats just 17 at 3 tables plus 5 stools at a built-in counter.  It struck me as clean inside & was fairly busy during my 11 AM visit partly with takeout orders.  Ok Mexican pop music played & the air temperature & lighting were about right.  I ordered a #1 Lunch Special from one of the not-very-friendly staff members which brought out a ground beef hard taco a beef tamale & a tostada.  This food was ok but not great & you have to be careful how you order here or the prices are HIGH!  That limits your lunch options a lot if you care anything about value & rendered this place completely NOT SPECIAL.  Ok its better than Taco Bite!     :-O  Taco Tamale & Tostada Plate $5.99',2

'I was expecting a complete geek-fest I must admit. I was expecting to get harassed by medieval dorks and that sort of thing. But I was wrong. This was thoroughly enjoyable. Buy tickets at Frys before you go and gas up because its quite a drive with only one city between Tucson & Apache Junction. Parking was easy. I was surprised to see actual structures making up this little town of vendors stages & game booths. There were performers fun and delicious food at reasonable prices and cute little shops everywhere you turned. The rides were so hilarious and ingenious. Many were powered by the riders (great for wearing the kids out) or else there were operators to hand power them and there were even elephant rides. The people visiting the fair were as diverse & delightful as the fair itself. I would love to go again and would highly recommend this fest to anyone looking to get some kicks in before the summer heat sets in! OMG-VISIT THE TOMATO THROWING INSULT BOOTH (VEGETABLE JUSTICE)!!!! ITS A RIOT!!!!!!',4
'Love this place I go at least twice a week. This place is so much better than the other ones in town. They have the most amazing tomato soup I have ever had it is very different but so yummy. Their customer service is outstanding Im always in and out in a timely manner. Oh and the best part? You get a free chocolate covered strawberry with every meal!',5
'Giving it a solid three stars!   Maybe my scale is off because I just recently moved from the Bay Area to Phoenix but you gotta blow me away to get five stars. On a grading scale I view a 3 as a B a 4 as an A and 5 as an A+.  Now that Ive level-set where I am coming from I can get in to the review.   I stopped in to One Coffee to wait for a friend to meet me. It was a weekday morning and very quiet inside. There were a couple ladies working behind the counter. I tried ordering a coffee drink similar to something I am used to ordering at Starbucks and got a bit of an attitude. Ok I get it corporate giant - independent coffee shop so I let that go. I ordered a drink and a panini sandwich and went to find a table to work on my laptop. My sandwich was delivered to my table and it was pretty good - pesto on focaccia (Ive noticed that Phoenix has a thing for focaccia) coffee drink was great a little too sweet for my taste but I did order a sweet drink. The coffee flavor itself was great.  They were playing some progressive punk station on Pandora and the commercials kept coming on which was weird and took away from the vibe they were trying to create (Tip: Pay the $36 a year for no ads or get a DMX box)   All in all a good shop but I noticed due to its location you cannot really drive to it without having to look for parking. Good if you are in the area on foot and want to stop in for a coffee.',3
'Ive only been to On The Rocks once but had a good time considering what I was going for.  I met a few friends for a low-key night at a bar where we would know no one.  Enter On The Rocks.    Between Thomas and McDowell on the east side of Scottsdale road this strip mall bar has no rules.  Its very chill with a few local faithfuls at the bar.  We were over dressed but no one minded everyone pretty much kept to themselves.  I think there are some video games in the back but we occupied ourselves with the shuffle board table which was a blast.  Super cheap drinks are also a blast.  Definitely a rougher crowd than youll see elsewhere in Scottsdale but not intimidating or rude.  A great place to go wearing flips and a t-shirt or if you want to leave the house and not give a shit about anything.',4
'I ordered the turkey avocado wrap and she brought me the wrong sandwich which had cashews in it and I am highly allergic to peanuts and when I let her know she offered me a new one of the right sandwich I had ordered but still charged me for it!!!! Stay away as they always screw up orders!',1
'Amazing. So delicious. The shop itself is beautiful with a nice sitting area if you want dessert and cocktails. We picked up a few chocolates and a bar and were not disappointed in the least bit.  The dark ganache truffle is rich fantastic delicious. Hazelnut is wonderful coconut is yummy with a nice texture milk ganache is simple and sweet and the Irish creme was beyond what I would expect.  The milk gooey chocolate bar is perfectly balanced with caramel. Usually bars like this are overdone and too sweet but this was the best.  I cannot wait to stop in again and have a cake based dessert with a cocktail. This place is a little pricey but definitely worth it.',5
'Fantastic service at a great price!  I had cracked glass on my Galaxy S3 and I called them late on a Friday a few minutes before closing. Dan let me know that he didnt have the glass on hand at the moment but he would have it when they opened at 11 am Saturday. I was there and he took care of me immediately. The repair took less than an hour and the phone is as good as new.',5
'Tried this place for lunch had the chicken burro and have to agree with the other reviewers. I wouldnt recommend Matador and am still baffled that it was packed at lunchtime.',2
'The only complaint I have about this place is that I wish there was another location closer to my home. My Key is set up inside the Chocolate Star Bakery (which is also phenomenal!) The coffee is delicious to say the very least full bodied and rich full of flavor...the owner roasts grinds and pours the coffee all himself. The place is completely about the ambiance and experience..from the gingham table cloths to the porcelain cow creamer...everything about this place oozes quality. A great cup of coffee in a cozy little place with friendly conversation...it was the perfect escape in my busy day. I will definitely be going back to this place! I hope they stick around.',5
'great casual atmosphere and interesting food!    Chrysa Robertson and her gang do a great job with local and organic foods.  the lamb chops are succulent and savory.    also you will never go wrong with the scallops when they have them.  moms pecan bar with icecream is a great way to finish your meal.....and of course they have GREAT fresh roasted coffee',5
'Ive been to Kazimierz many times. I keep going back because while the experience is always enjoyable its never exactly the same.  Its the perfect spot to enjoy a nightcap (if you can find a seat) or slide in after a long day at work. The wine list is as expansive as youll find in the area and theres a bottle for every price point - some of my favorites have been under $30 a bottle but if youve got a grand or two blowing a hole in your pocket Im sure theyve got just the thing for you as well.  Sometimes its even enjoyable to walk in by myself on a weeknight and read the wine list over a glass. Its that big.  To me its the kind of place that bears checking out at least once.',5
'Ive probably eaten here 20 times.  10 times w/ my wife too.  Always good food and eaten a bunch of different things.  Good deal and good service too.  Food will surprise you',5
'We went there for lunch and everything was good. Ive got to say the company was what made the lunch truly enjoyable but Id go back there again.',3
'BEST PIZZA: 5 Stars all the way!  Nellos famous motto;  In Crust We Trust! forever holds true!  This is the BEST deep dish Chicago pizza in the Valley of the Sun bar none!   My sister originally found Nellos over 28 years ago (some of their original customers) when it was a one or two table small outfit located in a single wide strip mall store front at McClintock and Southern.  We loved the Numero - Uno with gourmet sausage and mushrooms ever since! Telling hundreds of people over the years how good the place was has caused them to grow into a doublewide store then triplewide and now currently four or five valley locations!  We make it a point to bring every one of our guests here and they never leave dissappointed.   What makes Nellos soooooo good has to be the crust and sauce! We make it a point to ask for a side of the pizza sauce to dip our crusts in total enjoyment.  Make sure to start with a Mozzarella Platter for an appetizer while waiting for the pie to arrive!  My favorite after the #1 is the Alaskan King seafood pizza with white sauce w/ mushies green peppers and fresh tomatoes. Sometimes I special order the Numero Uno with the Alaskan Crab extra if you enjoy the red sauce more - Delicious!  Our kids love the Hawaiian topped with loads of mozz ham and a generous portion of pineapple chunks.   Where else can you order up an Enchilada Pizza??  Southwestern red sauce topped with tender grilled chicken black olives onions and green chiles sour cream and guacamole.  Mmmm SPICEY!  Deluxe Combo cant be beat fully loaded or try the Skinny: Homemade sausage pepperoni salami meatballs and bacon! That is the Pie of all Pies!   For side drinks my wife from South Africa loves to get a picher of Guava Juice to soak in a flavor from home and this is a great place to take kids or buddies for a game on the many TVs.  The Murphy with bacon and onions or what used to be known as the Popeye: Fresh Spinach garlic mushies tomatoes olive oil mozz and feta cheese. The list goes on from BBQ Chicken to the Buffalo Wing Pizza that packs a punch!!   What more can I say?? Im gettin hungry writing this FIVE star review! Go and see why they have won the New Times Best of Phoenix some 10 or 15 years!  PS: A little tip if you order 4 pizzas ya get da 5th one FREE :)) Stock up and put em in your fridge.  Also check out my review for the Aloha Kitchen next door to Nellos as it is the best Hawaiian food in PHX....Cheers!!',5

'My husband and I went to Cask 63 for dinner last night.  The interior of the restaurant is beautiful.  Its modern and clean.  I made reservations for 7:15 they were incredibly busy and as far as I could tell full but we were seated as soon as we walked in.  Our waitress was very nice and came by to take our drink orders.  When they brought our drinks out they also brought a bread plate that had soft pretzel sticks and three different flavored butters.  The pretzel bread was insane.  I could have just eaten that for dinner.  We started off with the trio of crab cakes.  Honestly I didnt really like two of them.  The tradition Maryland crab cake was really good though.  I got the scallop entree and my husband got the cheeseburger.  My scallops were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The bacon and mustard vinaigrette was one of the best tasting things Ive ever had in my life and the wild rice was a perfect accompaniment.  I cleaned the plate!  My husband loved his cheeseburger.  It was so flavorful; he was full about half way through his meal but kept eating because it was so good!  We finished our meal with the flourless chocolate cake.  It was amazing.  It came with cherry chutney that was so good I could have eaten it alone.  Normally my dislike of the appetizer would have dropped this down to a 4 star review but everything else was so good it made up for the crab cakes!  This was one of the best meals weve had since we moved to Arizona five years ago.  The service is also really great.  They have a large staff and everyone we interacted with was extremely nice.  The price wasnt too bad either.  We had the appetizer two entrees a soda a cappuccino and the dessert for $70.',5
'Tried it for my first time today and all I can say is YUM!  Had the Italian 12 which is easily large enough to share with someone. I added sweet peppers and mayo and it was delicious!!! 100% fresh meat veggies and the bread was perfect.  I am definitely a fan and will even say it was the best Italian sub Ive ever had.',4
'Closer to Meh than A Okay---We went for happy hour. The $5 glasses of wine are awesome but the food specials are not that special. Cold bruschetta? Yuck. We ordered 2 glasses of wine and 3 appetizers. I have been here several times and received good service. Our service wasnt bad; the server was friendly. But she knew nothing about the menu or the food. She wasnt sure which wines they were out of (for a wine bar the selection is pretty small). Also we ordered the cheese plate and in the past we have been told which cheese is which and so on. Our server dropped our food off without a word. A wine and cheese class might be helpful for the servers who should be knowledgeable about the selection both food and wine. Also and this seems picky the menu is difficult to read. The wines are grouped strangely and within categories there is no rhyme or reason to the listing. Artichoke dip and cheese plate were both yummy by the way.',3
'My suggestion?  Go for breakfast!  I have been here a few times and received spotty service: either my coffee cup is filled after every sip or I am left to wonder if the waitstaff even know that Ive been seated!  However it is hard to ruin breakfast and you cannot beat the price: $6.25 for 2 eggs hashbrowns choice of meat and toast.  I cant decide whether I like the cheap eats or the valet service better!',3
'The Chandler Fashion Center drives me absolutely crazy! It has the generic mall stores that you can find in just about every mall nowadays (AE Abercrombie Express BR JCrew etc). It has an incredibly weird layout so it feels like you are always doubling back to go to the stores you want.  Parking especially on a Friday night is a disaster.  The lot is always really full but when you walk inside there arent the amount of people you would expect for how many cars are in the lots.  The selections in the stores I frequent are not as good as at the Scottsdale Fashion Square.  The two things I like about the Chandler Fashion Center:   1. Barnes and Noble...I love there is a B&N at the mall. Its not the best B&N ever but for a break from shopping I appreciate it. The only negative of this B&N is that right outside of it is the little kids play area. Its a little hard to enjoy book shopping when you can hear 20 little ones screaming their heads off.  2. Carvel ice cream stand at the Food Court...I think Ive died and gone to heaven!!!  I spent my first 10 years living on Long Island (NY) and grew up going to Carvel.  To me Baskin Robbins TCBY and Dairy Queen all pale in comparision to Carvel.  To get a sugar rush while shopping I can savor a cup of chocolate soft-serve with rainbow sprinkles....yummy!  I guess if you live in Chandler or around it its a decent place to go shopping.  But since I live almost equi-distant from both Chandler Fashion Center and the Scottsdale Fashion Square Id pick Scottsdale anyday.',3
'Groupon had a summer special for half off membership to the Botanical Gardens. I always thought them to be too yuppy for me and the upscale version of Boyce Thompson but I couldnt resist and it made a great evening with the family while they were visiting.   Its very beautiful but definitely different than the outdoor days Im used to. You could probably get away with wearing heels and a dress for a day at the botanical gardens. Theres no hiking or rough paths or uncharted waters.  However the night tour is beautiful and very educational. I saw some lizards doing pushups and a tortoise eating a prickly pear fruit.',3
'After getting urged by some friends/coworkers to start dry cleaning my clothes (apparently they think I am incapable of working an iron...which...I am) I finally broke down and tried it.  And my very first encounter with a dry cleaner was Fresh Cleaners.    Fresh Cleaners is a relatively new dry cleaning place near Whole Foods in Chandler.  Since it is close to me I thought it was a great place to start my dry cleaning experiences.  I was immediately impressed!  It is a family owned small business that prides itself on being very personal.    The owners are great and have made it a point to remember me and what I like.  They treat me like Hollywood royalty and I love every second.  My clothes are always perfect when I pick them up.  They have even tailored and stitched up some pants for me.  And it is fairly inexpensive too.  I take 10+ dress shirts and a few pairs of pants every time and it has never cost me more than $25 bucks.  I believe they give a discount if you bring your hangers back in.  This might be common at all dry cleaners but it is a nice added touch that I appreciate.   I highly recommend this place if you live near it.    Their website needs some work though.  I wonder if they might want this nerd to assist them.  I totally would for little more than a few free dry cleanings!',5
'Im not familiar with Hawaiian food and so I may be short-sighted in my review but I didnt really care for Leos.  My husband liked his pretty well and would probably have gone with a high three but since this is my review I need to give it a 2.  The place was very clean and cheery in a strip mall restaurant sort of way.  I ordered the teriyaki chicken.  It came with cabbage and my original thought was great something pretty healthy.  But the cabbage was underneath the chicken which was soaked in the teriyaki sauce and was somewhat greasy.  This made the cabbage quite soggy and unappealing to my taste.  It also came with a generous scoop of their macaroni salad.  I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers who said it had too much mayonnaise and not enough flavor.    I would pass on going back - but my plus one would probably be easily persuaded.',2
'The Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees it was over an hour wait but they keep ice water outside so you dont die and in my opinion its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back just order your goods to go.   But back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there from the service to the food.  Id definitely come back!!',5
'Aloha Kitchen is an endless source of incredibly awesome well made delicious yum-foods! Ive dined here countless times and have tried all sorts of things from their surprisingly varied menu... When I was a carb whore I used to go full hog on the Teriyaki Bulkogi Plate and Id ask for an extra side of the Macaroni Salad (its SO GREAT) and savor each grain of their super sticky white rice.. Now that my diet has changed a great deal Im a bit more of a salad guy and Im thrilled to report that Aloha Kitchen has possibly the best salad Ive ever had: The Chinese Chicken Salad.  Its huge inexpensive super fresh tasty and crispy. It features a truckload of Teriyaki Chicken some fried noodle crunchies slivered almonds mandarin oranges and a variety of really awesome leaves.  The dressing is exquisite too! Im concentrating on the details of the salad because it doesnt seem to get the attention it deserves in other reviews.. but as my love affair with salads grows deeper and more serious this may be the salad in which I judge all others against  Along with all of their other WOO HOO yay plates if youre there while theyve got Spam Masubi on the counter GRAB IT. Or three.. I never knew SPAM could taste soooo amazing. Restaurants like Aloha Kitchen are a huge part of what I love about living in the Phoenix Area: Honest amazing affordable food thats served by independent establishments. OH AND: Their seafood anythings are also SO GREAT! They are also masters at the art of fried foods. Woot!',5
'A friend of mine invited us to dinner here.  Its been a while since weve been to Macaroni Grill.  We use to eat at a Macaroni Grill for lunch all the time but in recent years have ignored it.  I have a favorite dish....the Pasta Milano (Roasted Chicken Sun-Dried Tomatoes Mushrooms Farfalle Pasta in a roasted Garlic Cream Sauce $11.99).....but I got it without Chicken since Im on a no Meat diet.  The Better Half ordered the Crusted Sole (Filet of Sole topped w/Lemon Butter & served w/Sun-Dried Tomato Spinach Orzo $14.99).  I didnt like my Pasta Milano.....the Cream Sauce was very watery and didnt have much flavor....bland which has never happened to me when Ive ordered it.  The Better Half enjoyed her Sole but didnt think it was anything beyond average.  My friend ordered the King Salmon ($17.99) and enjoyed it.  If I was rating this dinner on my experience alone it would have been 2 Stars....but since the other two dining with me enjoyed their meal Im bumping it up to 3.  The service was so/so.....young wait staff here with plenty to learn about service....I didnt ding them because of their inexperience.  They were pleasant and sincere....which goes a long way with me.  Return Factor - 30%',3
'We came here for dim sum after rave reviews from some trusted friends.  Well....  eh.  First their duck tongues.  Supposed to be great.  Frankly they were like chicken feet.  Nothing to them.  Just bone (yes theres a bone in the tongue).  Not really the fault of Mekong Palace of course.  Just the nature of the duck tongue.  But as for the rest it was very strange.  Pretty much everything we had tasted basically the same.  Shumai dumplings...everything.  Tasted the same.  Not that it tasted bad.  It didnt.  But whats the point in a variety of things if they all taste basically the same?  It was boring.  Probably wont be coming back here.',2
'Very nice sports facility.   Has multiple softball fields for both softball and kick ball leagues.  Also has batting cages along with sand volleyball courts.',4
'The sauce is usually the under-appreciated element of pizza but its front and center at Spinatos.  Ones opinion of Spinatos hinges almost totally on his opinion of the unusually sweet sauce.  After yesterdays experience Ive decided that I love Spinatos as on occasional treat but its a little rich to be my go-to pizza place.  Everything besides the sauce on the pizza was nearly beyond reproach.  The crust was thin and crisp but not like a cracker.  It still had some chewiness.  The aforementioned sauce and cheese went nearly out to edges of the pie.  The pizza was cut into squares and toppings were carefully and evenly applied.  The mushrooms were outstanding because theyre the canned mushrooms that remain plump and juicy when cooking.  The bell peppers and ricotta cheese were OK although the ricotta added even more sweetness.  One renegade black olive somehow made it on my pizza which I found endearing.  If youre not in a pizza mood they have a full menu with sandwiches salads calzones etc.  They actually have a calzone stuffed with spaghetti.  On a previous visit we ordered it just as a conversation topic leading to jokes like ... so why are Americans getting fatter?  I have to admit that the little carbohydrate bomb was pretty tasty.  Nothing was special about the restaurant itself.  (After all its a converted Chilis.)  But the pizza is special.  Its high quality and definitely distinctive which is rare to say about pizza.',4
'This place never disappoints. Ive eaten at  both the Los Angeles and Pasadena CA location. The Scottsdale location did not disappoint!  The decor here was nicer than the other locations still rocking that chic and hip vibe that the W hotel and roku restaurants always have. We came with a large group of people so we ordered a ton of dishes. Here are some highlights and must haves: 1) yellow tail with diced green chile: paper thin slices of hamachi bathed in a yuzu sauce topped with tiny pieces of diced green and red chile. It was delicious as always! 2) spicy tuna on crispy rice: i always order this at every establishment that offers it on the menu and I find that roku does it the best. The rice its served on is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and comes out warm. Its piled on high with spicy tuna thats bursting with flavor and heat.  3) miso marinated cod: this is another dish I always order when its available. Its not as good as Nobu Matsuhisas but still delicious. The fish is so delicate it flakes apart easily with a fork and melts in your mouth releasing the flavors and sweetness of both the fish and miso marinade. Absolutely delicious! 4) Chilean sea bass: this is another really delicate fish that had great flavor and served nicely seasoned sautéd spinach.  5) crunchy spicy tuna and avocado roll: tuna and avocado with tempura flake crust 6) spicy tuna and shrimp in rice paper roll (I forget the actual name of it): the rice paper gives this roll a unique and delicious flavor.  7) rock shrimp: tempura style mixed with a sweet sauce.   8) mixed seafood tempura: the batter was light and flaky. The scallop and asparagus were my favorites.  9) edamame (soybeans): made al dente and came out steaming hot to our table lightly salted. Delicious!   Everything here from the service to the food to the ambience is great. This place rocks!!',5
'Tucked away next to the Subways in a shopping center at Dobson and Main is this FANTASTIC place !!  My wife and I live in Prescott Valley and there isnt a Chinese restaurant there that deserves to be called Chinese.  Waaayyyy different story here.  They have an AZ Menu for those used to Americanized Chinese food and the Hong Kong menu for the REAL DEAL.  When we arrived at 2:15 p.m. the place was jammed and thankfully most of the patrons were Chinese!!  Thats the first tell that you have a good place.  Secondly the Hong Kong Menu had 4 times the number of pages than the AZ Menu - -also a good sign.  My wife and I ordered 5 dishes which amazed the waitress.  After we explained about where we lived and that there will be a takeout order as well as the leftovers she was very happy and understood.  We had the crispy tofu steamed chicken with vegetables beef stew hot pot combo chow mien and beef with XO sauce.  Everything was fantastic.  The sauce that came with the crispy tofu was a house specialty and really added a lot to a normally bland dish.  We used the same sauce on the steamed chicken which was quite tasty by itself.  Beef with XO sauce was initially spicy but tamed down the more of it you ate.  The  beef stew hotpot - one of the best I had anywhere and  the combo chow mein was above par.  We did have a large amount left over which was packed to go with our added order for beef stew noodle soup wonton noodle soup and Yangchou fried rice.  Havent yet tried those as it was only yesterday that we went.  However I have no doubt that they will be even more delectable as soup only gets better with time.  We will definitely be back.',5
'This is a spot when you want to splurge on gourmet food or youre celebrating. Ive been here 3 or 4 times. I had my 30th bday on the Edge lounge with a group of about 20 friends and just had drinks and appetizers. Another time on Valentines day with my husband and then recently about 2 months ago for my friends engagement celebration. Absolutely the best spot with a great view in the Phoenix area! I bring visitors here in the daytime for coffee to enjoy the view. As far as the food I had the grilled tofu special with a sauce that had wasabi it was sooo good. A blend of soft crunchy sweet and spicy all blended to perfection. A side of truffle oil mac n cheese was a great pairing. All the desserts looked yummy I think we tried the cheesecake. The only reason I gave it 5 stars was because of the ambiance the decor and for the food with an amazing view! The only downer was the poor service we got the last time I was there the server was slow and not that intuitive. You would expect over the top service for a pricey restaurant like this.',5
'Chipotle is good mostly organic Mexican fast food. I mainly eat here because it is cheap and healthier than most fast food. I usually get the burritos but they have tacos quesadillas and bowls. The attraction for me is the delicious meats. The barbacoa here made me fall in love with barbacoa because it is so flavorful. The steak and chicken is great too because they are usually locally raised and without hormones. I dont care for the carnitas (pork) here because it is too dry.  For toppings they have three types of salsa corn cheese sour cream lettuce guacamole white or brown rice black beans pinto beans and peppers and onions. The sour cream is way too watery for me and lacks flavor. They have chips soft drinks and beer. That is pretty much their whole menu but you tell them what to put on your burrito or bowl or whatever you are getting so you can change it up each visit.  One other downfall is that you dont get your tortillas browned on your burrito like you would at some other places that serve Mexican food. The barbacoa burrito I got tonight was $9.24 after tax because I got guacamole for $1.80 extra.  Overall Chipotle is decent but it is up to the customer to be creative and go against the norm if you want something like pollo asada then you would have to tell them to skip the rice and beans and just give you a ton of chicken the green salsa and guacamole. If you think like this you can stave off boredom for a while since they dont have some of the other things you would get at other Mexican places like fish or shrimp tacos mexican rice refried beans chimichangas taquitos tortas or tostadas.  Dear Chipotle corporate: If you are listening I like your concept but more variety would be welcomed with open arms.  I realize that some of the items Chipotle doesnt make are not very healthy (like anything fried) but how easy would it be to make tortas or shrimp tacos?  Just saying...',3
'Finally go to check this place out.  Town and Country is certainly in a revival and it only took about 10 years of gloom and doom first.  Anyways Friday night actually got a table right away. Service spotty forgot a fork forgot napkins no biggie but had to mention.  But nice hip place to get a meal if you cool with spending over $100.  The bread is awesome.  The beer selection ok.  Didnt care for the 2 they have on tap.   I got 2 pizzas one I liked and one I didnt care for with sausage.  The field of greens is friggin lettuce with some dressing skip that.  The Antipasto appetizer errrrr it was ok but nothing to write home about.    Had the flourlesss chocolate cake and an apple think with vanilla gelato.  Very good indeed.  Great to see T&C doing much much better it is alive again with more stuff coming as Baby Kays is now torn down and a new restaurant to open there?  Checked out Whole Foods pretty cool too.   All in all not sure what the fuss has been all about this pizza I would wait 10 minutes if I had to not hours.  Maybe its just at their original location.  I really like the crust but the pizza itself is soggy and I dont like soggy.   Not rushing back.  Sorry be-atches I dont like soggy pizza....for $18 each I wants me some cripsy pizza not soggy.....',3
'Loved this place.  Out of all the five local coffee joints I stopped by during a trip to Phoenix this one Id have to say was the best of them.  I drove past them while pursuing breakfast but decided to stop by on my way back down 7th to have a cup of coffee and figure out what to do with the rest of my day.  There isnt a ton of parking but there is plenty of places to park on the street.  Its a small cozy repurposed gas station as everyone else has pointed out and the interior is simple yet relaxing feeling.  Parents with their kids sit outside of this kind of place.  Older people relax with a cup of coffee with their dog on a leash at this kind of place.  Younger hipsters hang out inside on their mobile devices at this kind of place.  The garage door was open so a cool morning in Arizona could be enjoyed by everyone.  The couches inside were precariously cushy as they engulf you when you sit down.  The cookie I ordered as a dessert to breakfast was still warm when it was served to me.  The chocolate chips were gooey and soft and it was practically right out of a commercial with a slow camera pan on my hands as I ripped a chunk off with a rivulet of milky chocolate stretching away.  The coffee was not burnt-tasting or overly bitter and was probably the best I had on my trip.  And everyone who worked there was polite and friendly.  Several of them took the time to address my questions about the area and if they had any suggestions of anything to do whether it was in the city or out in Surprise where I was headed.  The experience as a whole was easily worth five stars.  Convenient location free parking great atmosphere friendly staff and quality products.  Easily a repeat trip next time Im out in Phoenix.',5
'Ah my favorite not so secret secret bar. Fantastic place to take a date even better place to chill with your girls and a yummy drink. Not just sweet foo foo drinks (though the white rabbit never fails me)...no there some kind of sparkly ginger fastasma that seems like it could be a manly drink. The seating is lounge style low lights and original art lining the walls. Hipster Central Phoenix crowd but laid back and not too cool for you. I always come here when I go there.',5
'I feel so lucky to live so close to a large space so my dog can run around. I wouldnt say this is in a bad neighborhood but I wouldnt say its in a great neighborhood either. If you keep a good eye on your dog and are a responsible pet owner I dont see why you would have anything other than a blast here.  Plenty of parking bags are usually provided for poop and most of the owners are friendly enough.  I believe dog parks are places where the experience you have depends on what you put into it!',4
'This place has some awesome sushi. Had dinner there last night. I love everything they serve and Ive been here on about 10 different occassions. (They serve Pepsi as well!!!) The reason I did not give them 5 stars is because as mentioned previously the service is not the best...and I sat at the bar last night. I had to pull the hostess over to get a refill in my Pepsi. Secondly not a huge selection of Sushi. They do serve everything I like but they could open it up a bit.',4
'This place is awesome hands down! You can not beat the happy hour/reverse happy hour specials and there is always a ton of people there. The one downside is that happy hour specials are only served in the bar area or outside but that doesnt bother me much even if I do have to wait a litle while for a table. Their margaritas pack a punch and they make really great specialty drinks. Never had a bad experience here and I love the location. Whenever we want to go somewhere for happy hour kona grill is usually our first suggestion.',5
'I love the place and the set up.  I also like the beers.  The only reason I give this 3 star rating is because the food isnt that great. The first time I ate here was the best but then after that the quality just went down after that. I did try a couple of the entrees but never was satisfied with the meals.',3
'I like K ODonnells its A-OK.  We have been here a few times most recently last week. The food is basic sports bar stuff and good. Weve enjoyed the Pizza Burgers Loaded Nachos Quesadilla Fries Potato skins Onion rings et cettera.   BTW they have a nice selection of  beers on tap. I particularly like their Pale Ale/IPAs including Sierra Nevada. The bar area has about seven or eight TVs going.  Just for fun count the remotes near the cash register.  For some one of the pluses of coming to KOs is the benefit of their shuttle bus. Its for those who need a ride home and really dont want to take the chance of having a personal fitting for one of Sheriff Joes pink jump suits. LOL  Also be on the lookout for those blue envelopes that come in the mail... they have coupons for KOs inside.',3
'A solid hotel but nothing to rave about.   I have stayed here a few times; its not a bad hotel lets get that out I enjoyed staying at this hotel but it doesnt rise to the level of a westin or even the sheraton down the street (sheraton as a chain is hit or miss btw) but when you compare with other local hotels nearby its in the middle.   On a side note its in the middle of town a short walk from everything and a quick ride to Tempe or Scottsdale.  The local restaurant scene isnt that big compared to seattle but like a good reduction whats there is wonderful eats.  A few good places featured on the Food Network.   All in all its a good location for business travel no nonsense soild hotel.  If you like Hyatt then this is another winner.  If you like hip this isnt the place for you.',3
'The Drive Thru times wasnt that bad 6mins. I can live with that of course the others waited way longer. I ordered The Standard with cheese pretty good! It wasnt the WOW factor I was expecting. Blame @johnjayvanes for that one. The sauce was okay but it didnt bring anything out maybe jalapenos to give that extra flavor. They have a special between 11am-3pm you get a free side of fries. Free!? Sure Ill take it. Shouldve actually left it if cooked fully it wouldnt have been bad. But over half of the fries were way under cooked a few were still raw.  But what I really wanted from The Stand was the Dulce de Leche shake. Im a big sweet and salty fan plus ice cream? This is up my alley. Five bucks was on the high side but it didnt disappoint. It looked NO WHERE near the picture posted on the main business page here. It was extra blended and the guy actually wiped up the side before handing it over (thank you for that). Regardless it was delicious! Ill be returning for the shake only.',3
'The atmosphere is very elegant. You are able to sit outside or inside. Outside has a bocce green which is actually pretty fun. The food was very different and the selection is very minimal. It was pretty delicious but since there is only a small selection of food some people may not be able to find something they like. This is a rare 4 star review when the food for one reason or another isnt up to my standard. The scenery was that stunning though so I couldnt give lower than 4 stars. Check the menu before you decide to come here to make sure there is something you like.',4
'I love the naked chicken burrito and the queso with chips is very good. I have experienced friendly service and  I am sure it wont be long before I am back.',4
'Got serviced by Brad. Very disappointed with the experience because of him.',2
'One of my favorite hotels in Phoenix.  I worked there for a year and have stayed there a few times as well.  Love the boutique feel the colors the furniture the great atmosphere the art the pool the rooftop....  I have been to fashion shows here and spent the most awesome new years eve ever here.  I have gotten guys to get naked and jump in the pool I have done naughty dirty things in the hallways!  I have met numerous celebrities here.  I hung out with Cheech from Cheech and Chong at the bar.  I have been to magazine launches and birthday parties.....  Every time I go in there something new and exciting has happened or changed!    I love this place and I love Ben too!  I hope it is around forever!',5
'Three of us decided on trying Binks today for a work lunch.  The interior is quite nice.  With the weather being so nice the doors were open....and we had flies buzzing around for the next hour--they need to get some screens in place. I had read about their hot/cold starters.  The bread that came to the table was undercooked and doughy.  Had the cauliflower and dates (hot and cold).  The cauliflower had a nice flavor with a hint of yellow curry--it could have been warmer.  The dates didnt have much presentation or integrated flavor.  Id skip that next time.  My table mates had the brussel sprouts--high marks.  Also the sloppy joe and a salad.   Service was slow even though we were one of maybe 2 other tables inside and a few on the front porch.  20 minutes plus on the food delivery.  We waited again about 10 minutes for the credit cards to come back.  All in all we would go back and are looking forward to their happy hour.  I think when they get the service honed it should flow better.  Nice staff!',3
'Mom used to call our neighbor a sex fiend. Mainly because she caught him parked in his driveway one night making out with one of my sisters friends. Moms terminology makes me want to invoke the word fiendishly good for anything delightful.   Although I never saw anything even remotely delightful about Maryanne Halston...ginormous slut that she was.   Bosas donuts are fiendishly good. Dont believe me? The real bellwether is the number of police cars parked in front on any given morning....folks this looks like a law enforcement convention.   If the po-po only knew how I methodically extract the creme / jelly fillings from the solid donuts before presenting them to my evil co-workers theyd snatch me up and take me into the 4th St jail lickety-split.    Whats really amazing is how my co-workers eat them anyway...without the filling. Fucking hogs.',5
'Ive been here coupla times in the past week or so.  Its a nice clean store nothing special pretty helpful clerks good selection average prices.  There is a nice big parking lot so you can always park close.',3
'Public areas were nice and spacious. Pools were sparkling but it was too hot to use the pool (113). Rooms were large. However the air conditioning unit was loud and blew so hard that the curtain was constantly flying.   Pros The staff was friendly and accommodating. JDs had good food and not just limited to fried bar food.    Cons Having to drive past their laundry facility and trash area to get to the rooms. Their breakfast buffet was really limited but our server was so much fun we didnt care.',3
'Ive been doing crossfit for just over two years and like to do drop-ins at the local boxes when I travel.    Today I did a drop in over at Hammer Crossfit and LOVED IT. The coaches Natasha and Kirez are very friendly knowledgable and helpful.  The gym is clean large and beautifully equipped.  A large space but still very personal for every member which can be a fine line to walk.  Best of all... for two years I have struggled and been unsuccessful at doing hand stands against the wall.  Kirez had me up and doing them on my own in under 10 minutes.  A MIRACLE WORKER I tell you.  A huge HUGE THANK YOU.    I cant wait to visit this box again and bring my husband along the next time Im in town.',5
'I wish I could live here. These cupcakes blow any other cupcake Ive ever had out of the water. Orange Blossom is my go-to on their daily menu. Margarita and Mexican Spice are my absolute favs but unfortunately (and maybe fortunately for my waist) they are usually only around once a month or so. On Tuesdays Short Leash food truck is there and Thursdays brings Luncha Libre. The staff is super friendly and the smells are intoxicating. My co-workers and I have to restrain ourselves from daily visits.',5
'Absolutely amazing!!!!  No cork fee just bring your own bottle!!',5
'This was a great place to stop for lunch. A great sandwich and bowl of soup. The setting with the flowers and trees makes you feel  miles away from a big city nearby. Lots of picnic tables and cafe tables with a  live flower on each one. If you want a relaxing lunch and a stress reliever you need to find this place and relax. Makes you feel  like you are on a picnic. Your food comes in a paper lined old fashioned basket. Put this on your to do list. They also serve fine dining at dinnertime.',5
'I was in late on a week day evening. Staff was attentive and knowledgeable. The wine list is unique and varied. I had the butternut squash soup which was superb. My friends ordered a cheese plate that seemed to be perfect. Ambiance is loud vibrant and bustling.   Good option in Old Town for some wine with friends or a date.',5
'I found this place by accident almost a year ago doctors office was nearby and I was early so I stopped in for lunch. The Blue Tortilla Enchiladas are absolutely amazing seriously the BEST enchiladas Ive had since forever.   9 months later Im back in town for awhile and staying not too far so I stopped in. Free Wi-Fi CHECK! Ive been sitting at the bar with a power source for every day of the past 2 weeks and I love this place.   The staff is fantastic. Nicole is by far by favorite bartender but you have Anthony Jared Lindsey Susan....the staff is freaking fantastic.   The ambiance is bloody fantastic and I feel comfortable here whether Im on a date or by myself at the bar or meeting up with some girlfriends.   DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE ITS FANTASTIC! I LOVE IT!!',5
'me before- really...all they serve is bread with weird stuff on it...??  me after- omg that was amazing! we need to make this our spot',5
'A place that ya dont have to wonder if its good for you. It all is.',4
'We had a great time at this place. The wait was only about 10min for Saturday night dinner. Outdoor seating is wonderful due in part to the location in relation to the Civic Center. Our server was great and quick to answer or find the answer to all questions we had regarding the menu. Our food was tasty and arrived at our table quickly. The decor is hip and fun. Overall a great experience.',4
'I can never find anything at this GAP. Except this time cargo shorts for my trip. Is it me or we Phoenicians will never dress like the models here.  Real nice but over clothed in my opinion.  Also they seem to be a lot different from most GAPs Ive been been to....hmmm is it really GAP or an imitator.... enjoy!',3
'Being from the great Pacific Northwest I really know my coffee! Having said that this may have been the best cup of coffee Ive ever had! The owner did a pour over  for my Americano and it was awesome!  I will definitely come back next time I am in town. And I would recommend anybody checking out this little shop!',5
'Went to Zur Kate last Friday evening. We got seated within 5 minutes..lucky I guess since this restaurant has good reviews. I recommended to my wife any of the schnitzels while I ordered the pork roast (special that evening).   My food was very good but I kicked myself afterwards for not following my own recommendation.  The Rahm schnitzel was to die for...absolutely amazing. My taste buds were very happy when my wife gave me 2 bites  of her plate. Order with the spaetzle and red cabbage and you will be happy.  We ended with the Apple Struddle and cheesecake..fantastic...although the Struddle  was a little bit soggy for our taste. - Service was excellent..decor and atmosphere felt relaxing and homey.  I will go back there for sure.',3
'Great Burgers fast and friendly service.  Its a bit hidden in the corner of a strip mall & small but nice inside.  Good selection of meats toppings and sauces and great fries.',5
'This review is simply done on the games and arcade. I have not eaten at this D & B s(yet).   Compared to the several other D & Bs Ive gone to around the US this location falls short with the games. The variety just isnt there and there seems to be less games than other locations.   The one good thing unlike other locations you dont have to wait for most games too long  (if any).',3
'Back in my poker playin days...hmmm...I still like poker just takin a break...my bro I used to work with took me here. The place is pretty chill. They have a restaurant bar decent sized poker room (all different limits) and slots of course.  Im a poker man so I went to the low limit tables after the Phoenix Open. The games here are soft. Ive played on several occasions and these guys are pretty loose. I played professionally for a little over a year so I know a good game when I see one. The only thing that sucked is that a dealer mistakenly called a jackpot when in fact the hand was not better than the board. That really sucked cuz the jackpot was something like $28000...but a win is a win!',4
'I had a really pleasant evening here.  The atmosphere is pleasant not pretentious.  The service was good.  Frankly it could have been a bit better but it was not bad so...  And the food was really good I think for a fair price.  I dont know why but I searched high and low for fish tonight and most Scottsdale restaurants were asking $22.00 for an entree.  I believe my Halibut entree here was $18.00...with asparagus and a cream sauce...yum!  We also tried the wild mushroom pasta dish.  OMG was it rich.  So yummy and so rich.  (Now if I could only find a man like that...just kidding.)',4
'Came here for lunch and we didnt want to leave.  The food was amazing and the staff was very friendly knowledgeable and eager to take care of the customers. The wife wants to to have a weekend get away at the hotel just so we can try more items.',5

'My favorite BBQ place yet in the valley. The meats are smokey with a very nice bark and smoke ring. This place is sort of cafeteria style so be prepared. I prefer to order at the outside window and take it home. Overall really really good BBQ!!!',5
'I hate to beat up a place too much as we ate there just days after opening and theres always kinks to work out with the menu and service.  I will say the server was nice and they tried really hard.  They also had about 5 hostesses on staff so there was no wait to be seated.  However--and this is a big however--the food was awful.  Awful as in the worst meal Ive had dining out in years.  In addition to the tempura fried pickles missing the mark (batter was just odd) the Stella tap clearly being hooked up to the Bud Light keg (my palate isnt that refined but I can tell BL from SA) everything was not just meh but cooked in a way you would cook food for your worst enemy.  The baked beans were worse than the cheapest canned beans you could buy the mashed potatoes LL ordered made instant potatoes desireable and the mac n cheese made me long for Kraft.  Believe it or not with all this being bad--its not the worse!  First the HH specials are probably the weakest Ive ever seen...why even have them?  The ONLY specials are domestic draws.  Thats it.  Nothing off the $11 martinis.  Nothing off import drafts.  REALLY???  My last gripe is the entree advertised as prawns with andouille sausage.  Not prawns.  Regular friggin shrimp.  Maybe 5 total.   Drowned in oil.  On a stick.  $2 worth of food for $20.  Oh and BTW the whole concept is everything goes on a stick (even the sandwiches).  And the whole focus point of the decor is some cheesy fire screensaver projected on a wall.  So in closing...I guess I was hard on the place.  But the server was nice.  If its around next year the owner has some deep pockets.  You expect hiccups with a new place but build-out on this took several months which is more than enough time to put together a menu.  Enough I dont want to relive the meal!',1
'Been here twice once for happy hour after work and once for lunch on a weekend with some friends.  First time was like 3 star experience... decent amount of beers on tap and solid happy hour food list. The bartender was a chick who was cute and was able to shoot the shit with us pretty well I was impressed.  The look and decor of the place is impressive and swanky reminds me of back home in LA.   As I was ready to leave it was pretty busy and there was a huge group of older guys. Above average first experience.  The second time was on a Saturday a couple weeks ago and my buddies wanted to check out a cool spot for food and drinks in Scottsdale so I took them here and it ended up being a good call.  For lunch this place is awesome as we got to sit outside on the couches got some GREAT cocktails (not cheap though) and my Pork Belly was really good.  1st experience 3 stars nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either.  2nd experience 5 stars chill lunch atmosphere with good food and good drinks...  If this place was a bit cheaper Id give it 5 stars but I will return regardless.',4
'Excellent service and food.  It was my first time eating Shashimi.  They served the tuna in the shape of a rose.  The friend I was with is an experienced sushi eater.  He thought it was very good.  Happy hour prices were good.  Half price rolls.',4
'Excellent food and service (read the flow of beer was satisfyingly rapid) overall the green salsa was wonderfully balanced providing a nice amount of heat with an excellent amount of taste. Unfortunately I was slightly disappointed in my gorditas as the chicken was slightly dry but otherwise the rice and beans were definitely above par. Unlike some Mexican or New Mexican restaurants I was pretty pleased with the freshness of the ingredients I didnt see brown lettuce or greenish tomatoes and while the chicken was disappointing the rest of our dining party was greatly pleased. I will definitely go back to take a stab at the enchiladas or something else that impressed everyone else.',3
'This is by far the *best* noodle place in town! Their BBQ pork ramen is absolutely delicious comes in a giant bowl and the noodles are perfectly cooked. Try the Milky Green Tea-- its my favorite drink on the menu. The owner is very pleasant and if you can catch bits and pieces of what shes saying in Japanese- also pretty hilarious :)',5
'about the 5th time  have eaten here.  Thai food is my all time favorite and this was good standard especially at lunchtime.  Out of my general range and construction woes keep me away.   Went there today after a long drive from Payson and had to pick up car from $1000 repair so was in area with mom and thought yum.  Went thru the back door.  about 10 people standing up front.  Asked them what is wait? they said dont know have been standing here at least 10 mins some longer.  many empty tables but full house waiting.  One waiter and I guess a table clearer?.  We decided to leave walking towards back waiter stopped us and said can put you at a table and bring water but 30-35 mins for food. Asked if someone out sick? He said no normal. That is just unacceptable.  was 1240 pm when got there.  If that is common they need more wait and kitchen staff.    Mom said lets just try it -so sat.  Many people upset some leaving as soon as they came in after talking to those up front. .  Waiter and clearer working like crazy seemed frenzied stressed and thought both were going to bolt out the door.  Lady next to us w/husband left had to get to dr apt so had finally gotten soup but never got lunch.  She told husband to bring it home. Both were really upset.  Staff kept apologizing.   Finally the  clearer guy brought us soup about 25 mins after sat down.  It was not even warm.  spring roll came with dry chewy and barely warm.  then food came.  I ordered Evil Jungle princess that I get there often.  Didnt look remotely the same.  My mom said that isnt what you ordered tell him.  I said no will just eat it.  Not going to wait for another order.   As long as no seafood all thai to me is good and I was having a bad day already. Wouldnt have mattered as we couldnt get him to come back glad some water on table for refill. The  restaurant started  clearing out some sort of calm returned and we were able to pay bill.  but all in all stressful disappointing experience for all the diners and felt sorry for the staff.  Mom liked her food other than wasnt very warm.  But she remembers it being so much better last time.  So another thai restaurant crossed off the list. Dont think would even eat there if needing something before Mesa theater play',2
'After our favorite restaurant of all time closed down (Stir Fry Paradise) we turned to AJs for our Mongolian BBQ fix. I remember coming here when I was younger when it was a YCs and honestly I cant tell the difference in quality. The prices arent terrible either for all you can eat. I will agree that it is kind of a depressing atmosphere but good food nonetheless.',4
'OK...Ive gotta give it up for G&S.  I finally tried it after I had heard from a few reliable sources that it was the place.  They were sure right.  But before you plan your Saturday night around the place Ive gotta be clear that the atmosphere isnt going to blow you away when you walk in the door.  It sits in a strip mall between a pool supply store and a Blockbuster and there isnt any of that fancy new Zen asian stuff going on.  Well...at least not well done.  There are a few tacky fountains and some circa 1985 booths and chairs...but thats not what youre going to be going there for anyway.  So we sit down and and inquire about a Happy Hour.  I guess that they dont do that anymore.  OK.  So our first 5 minutes made us think that maybe we should have done Flos instead despite the fact that we wanted to finally give this place a try.  So I ordered the Chef Special Noodles as well as the citrus chicken thinking that weve gotta go for the specialties if were going to give this place a one time shot.  Two minutes later our waitress tells me that they are out of the noodles so I am already doubting the recommendation.  So I ordered the beef noodles (chow fun) and sat back and waited.  5 minutes later the food comes out.  That was when I figured out why I had heard such magnificent things about George and Sons.  Wow!  The food was amazing!  The portions were wonderful and despite the fact that it tasted so fantastic I still have leftovers for tomorrow (or maybe when I am done with this review tonight!).  Just wonderful!  It was so fresh and so unique in flavor.  You could tell that their citrus sauce was the real deal.  It was created there by a cooking genius.  The chow fun was fantastic and although the service was simple...it was wonderful.  No attitude no ego and very little trendy atmosphere.  Just awesome food in a low key environment.  I will be back!  Oh yeah....I will be back!',4
'Actually pretty good. If you can see past the atmosphere then you can see that the food taste good. I tried a carne esada plate and it was good. Keep in mind this is relative to other restaurants in the same class it is above the other cheaper Mexican restaurants in the 7-10 dollar range.',4
'Came here about 10:30 on a Saturday night and it was kind of dead. Yes early I know and Im sure it gets better later right?  Whats up with the fake stalagmites in the back room.  The wine room has a very cool feeling to it but again whats with the stalagmites?  The music was --um how u say  not my thing.  Yes I m sure it got better as the night went on right?  This place was better than Sky bar but a distant second to Bar Smith.',3
'Omg Great I had the shrimp ench. with Chz Relleno.  Excellent',5
'Decided to try this place out after hearing how great it is from both the reviews on here and from word of mouth. It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you cant go wrong with any food consisting of bread brie prosciutto figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didnt quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out we dont know what were doing! and without even smirking she said shed take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass our friends show up we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here? We arent fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. Ill definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights our waiter got me with the Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights!',4
'Do not purchase video games here! Used games are ridiculously overpriced selling for more than double the price of new.',1
'I admit that was scared away from the habenero burger by the warnings on the menu. Fear of blindness of any length will keep me from ordering any item.  I did order a cheeseburger expecting similar love and taste to be put into this burger. Not true. Burger was dry and boring.  My wife ordered a turkey wrap with jalepeno bacon which she loved.   The building looks like a modern Scottsdale building outside but a cave inside. Pretty cool. Service was good.',3
'Heres how they rate on the 3 items any review needs:  Price:  youll spend more than youd expect Service:  they seem to avoid coming around Taste:  excellent  My guess is that this place has a dedicated and proud-of-his-work chef who is surrounded by a lackluster wait staff that looks at the clock and counts down the time that they get to leave.  I bet youll see them in gossip sessions in the hallways and service areas.  Good Luck.',3
'Sushi is my favorite food with that being said Ive had about every sushi place you can think of in the Scottsdale area. This is so far my favorite Ive had! Their sashimi is SO FRESH I feel like they have an ocean right outside the locale. The way their sushi is categorized is also very helpful they have a section for the spicy rolls and the non spicy rolls along with chef specials that you can choose whether you want spicy or non!  Prices- AMAZING. Seeing that everything was so cheap I was a bit skeptical to try it. Ive never had decently priced sushi that actually tasted phenomenal. yes PHENOMENAL sooooooo fresh and you can differentiate each individual roll because it each has its own unique flavor.   The staff is super friendly the sushi chef always remembers me and they have a great atmosphere. DEFINITELY recommend this place. MY favorite sushi place. I would drive from anywhere to acquire that fresh taste. AMAZING!',5
'I have been here several times and I think its pretty good.  I like the bean dip that they bring with the salsa but I wish the salsa was spicy!  I like to go for lunch since they have a $6.95 lunch special and theres alot of choices on the lunch special.  Would I say its my favorite place?  No....but its decent and the service is always good.',3
'This place is fantastic! Excellent food excellent service and very unpretentious. The owner is very personable and wanted to make sure we were happy with our experience. Cant wait to go back!',5
'The only bad thing about Roaring Fork is trying to find it and parking your car in a office building parking lot. Once you get inside everything is great even if you end up sitting on the patio. Ive taken a date there gone to happy hour with the guys and even treated the parents to a good steak. Green chile appetizer is unique and the Big Ass Burger is phenomenal. Beer and wine selection is fantastic only draw back is Im always too full for dessert.   TIP: Go on Mondays for all day happy hour!',4
'My favorite Mexican restaurant. Its NOT the kind that serves the slop bucket side of rice & refried pinto beans with 1lb of melted 3 cheese blend on it. My parents were visiting AZ and went here twice in 1 week.',4
'So I finally ate at the Maggianos that is in the city I live in.  Previously I had only enjoyed the take out from this location but had never eaten inside.  When I was in Denver I ate at the one in downtown.  The Scottsdale Maggianos did not disappoint!  I reciecved the same wonderful service as I did in Denver and my meal was great too!  Now please be advised that you can order half portions or full portions.  Half portions seem to be more then enought for most people.  Now...if your cooking skill is like mine (I make really fabulous reservations but not much else) you may want to opt for the full portion so youll have left overs.  YUM!!!!  Great service and great food!  Maggianos is alway consistant...no surprises!  Go and enjoy!',4
'Ive been getting acupuncture and chinese herbs for my migraines for a couple months now from Perry. Im sleeping better and my migraines while still around are much less intense. Ive gone from having twice monthly ER visits for migraines to no ER visits so thats a pretty good improvement. I was worried at first we wouldnt be able to afford the treatments but its so much less than I expected and with these results much more affordable than going to the ER and doctor all the time.   Everyone is super nice were able to get appointments later which is great so very little work gets missed. The no scent policy is appreciated too.   Everything is clean and modern and very comfortable.   I also love Heather the receptionists photography that is featured all over the place.',5
'WOW!!!! Unbelievable find in SOLO Trattoria! Cant say enough about the amazing food terrific atmosphere and warm hospitality of this family owned establishment. From the moment I walked in the door I felt like I had entered a friends home - sit where you feel most comfortable enjoy a relaxed atmosphere no serving pressure (thank you Eli!) fresh ingredients home style cooking and over the top mouth watering dessert. Something so simple - rigatoni and meatballs - was completely out of this world and the dessert - a pumpkin butterscotch and fresh whipped cream (orgasmic) - what a great way to end a day! Thank you Jackie - bravo!!',5
'Peach mango froyo with fresh fruit = a satisfied tummy. The fruit is all very fresh and delicious and the yogurt is refreshing and cold which is perfect for the Arizona weather. I wish the girls that worked here were a little more friendly but still I will definitely be returning here in the future.',4
'Once again another this place is awesome word of mouth place in Scottsdale that let me down.  I had been hearing about this place for awhile but its kind of far so when I saw the groupon for WCG it was the push I needed to head north.    Things that went wrong: - I didnt know it was a must have reservations kind of place but it is.  Thats fine though- you live and you learn but the way the hostess handled it was the problem.  She was very rude took our name and gave us the vibrator thing.  After sitting for 30ish minutes we heard another host tell people coming in that they could sit in the bar area or the patio instead of waiting.  Would of been nice to know when we came in!  -I dont like the fact that you have to ask for bread.  If a restaurant is gonna have bread it should just be automatically taken to the table.  It makes you feel like a fatty cheap ass wanting free food when you have to ask.   -I got the chicken crepes. The madeira sauce was just a dark gravy it just wasnt my thing so I cant blame them for me making a bad choice.  What I was mad about was the broccoli.  Ive had better broccoli from a school food service buffet line!  The broccoli was so overcooked that it turned to mush when you touched it with a fork.  AWFUL!  Should NOT happen at a nice restaurant.  Things that were good: -The server -My bf said the ribs were good.  I didnt try. -The white chocolate blonde brownie was amazing.  It is the only thing that is making me choose 3 stars rather than 2.  I will most likely not be returning here.  Not worth the drive or money.',3
'After dining in this ethnic restaurant I seriously want to visit Cambodia. I read some information about this country in books which were on our dining table.  We ordered their basil seed drink everyone is yelping about :) iced espresso w/condensed milk Shrimp Ling Che Kreung chicken/lemongrass stir fry and tapioca pudding. Everything was freshmade with love. Will come to dine again to try their other dishes!',5
'So good! So so good. Ive liked everything Ive had especially #23 -- fried tofu with rice noodles. One note -- if you eat in and you value good-tasting water avoid theirs; its just plain GROSS.',5
'Great waitstaff beautiful artwork on the walls delicious food.   We had the hot wings and the garlic bread for appetizers. I had the margherita 7 pizza. All of it was very tasty.   Prices are great especially for Old Town Scottsdale.',4
'Blair was extremely knowledgeable and helpful during my recent search for a house.  He was extremely prompt in returning phone calls and emails.  He gladly showed my wife and I as many houses as we wanted and took us back to review previously viewed properties.  He is extremely knowledgeable of the Phoenix market and can provide great insight into housing trends.  He recommended a neighborhood that neither my wife nor I knew about and we ended up buying our house there.  I would recommend him to any friends or family.',5
'Update. As of July 6 2012 It looks like this place is closed. Does anyone know for sure?',2
'Fast service and good food.  Great for a quick turn lunch.  Their new loyalty rewards card is pretty cool too.  You regiter it online and rack up rewards points for free food later.  Kind of novel for a sub shop.  Only down side is that I think their prices are a little high compared to other sub joints.',3
'I was so excited to finally try the place I ended up being early.  We paid our admission to the food funhouse that is YCs and then got down to business.  Armed with bowls the size of our heads we stepped to the buffet and I got my first look at what I was up against.  The first third of the buffet is filled with shaved curls of frozen meat in various varieties.  Beef Chicken Pork Alligator and Yak.  Frozen curls of Yak!  Okay so I lied about the Yak and the Alligator.  But you never know.  They SAID it was beef and chicken but seriously it could have been Yak!  I grabbed the tongs and threw a pile of meat in the bottom of my bowl.  I smiled at my accomplishment but she just looked over slightly concerned and then handed me a sheet of wax paper.  You need to smash it down. she said.  What? I replied? The meat she explaind patiently.  You need to smash it into the bottom of your bowl.  But Im not that hungry! I protested.  You will be and this is gonna last you for days.  See that guy on the end? Your bowl is supposed to look like that. She pointed towards the end of the buffet where I saw a towering mass of vegetables rising out of an already unfathomably large bowl.  It would easily feed a family of four.  His YC fu was impressive but I was sure I could top that.  Get Smushing she said as I refocused on the task at hand.  After I had pressed all the pretty curls of meat into a flat unrecognizable blob that filled the bottom half of my bowl we moved onto the vegetables.  If youve had it in Chinese food it was there.  I zeroed in on some celery cabbage bean sprouts carrots scallions and baby corn.  I piled it on with gluttonous abandon gleefully shaping my mountain of food to resemble the peak from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  The last third of the buffet contains sauces.  Many many many sauces.  Get them they are good.  They have recipes but seriously who wants to read directions?  I needed more sauce than I took and I thought I took a lot.  It would have helped to know they were going to slap it on a grill and immediately start diluting it with water.  Seriously I put like five or six scoops of various stuff in and it was still just barely sauced enough.  I supplemented with some spicy mustard.  So um.. then they cooked it and we ate it.  Sure it was good.  Yes I still have leftovers.  No you cant have them.  Is the food here the best Ive ever had? Hell no.  But its pretty good for fast/cheap/healthy-ish stuff and seriously who cares? They let you play with it for like half an hour before you even sit down.  Score!',4
'Still a fan! Had the burger which was meaty well-seasoned and juicy the crab dip which was rich and creamy (had to ask for a few more crackers which were happily provided) and the mac & cheese which had the nice tang I look for in a sharp cheesy dish -- and enough cheese that you had to twirl your fork to break the strands!',4
'I am a fan because this place is right around the corner from my place... sooooo that is fantastic. The food is alright nothing exciting Lots of good beer on tap and some really awful beer on tap. Check it out! I like it. :)',4
'Last Friday my mom and I went to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant for dinner. Glad we ate there. The food was AMAZING!! The service was TOP NOTCH!! We had Mike as our server and is one of the best servers weve ever had in any restaurant. Ordered a sangria (Mike makes the BEST sangrias!!). For dinner my mom ordered the Roasted Chicken Wrap. She said it was very good and flavorful. I ordered the Aegean Club which had bacon chicken gyro meat and tzatziki sauce on a warm pita.  For dessert we ordered the Baklava Cheesecake and wow it was very good!! Definitely will be back.',5
'Ive seen this place forever but never had time to check it out. I love simple solid roadside greasy spoon style eats and this place did not disappoint.   Staff was pleasant and efficient serving up working folks style eggs bacon biscuits and gravy done right in a pleasant no frills yet comfy setting. Clientele ran the gamut from drywall guys a couple lawyer looking dudes to two moms with a baby. Also love that its not a chain as I am always partial to supporting local mom and pop ventures. Reminds me of those middle of no where places you might find along Route 66 or something.   And in my book it all adds up to two big thumbs up for  Wandas.',4
'When we read that the head baker at Simply Bread was part of the USA team that upset the European favorites and won the Coupe de Monde de la Boulangerie in 2005 we had to check it out.  You can get Simply Bread at AJs and fine restaurants like Binkleys but we wanted to get right to the source.  They happened to be doing a promotion on mini rolls which was just perfect for us given how indecisive we tend to be when presented with such variety.  We got:  -  Walnut raisin: my favorite when done right and it was here - complex  flavor from the long fermented dough filled with thoughtfully sourced walnuts and raisins -  Black bean and corn: savory and nice crunchy texture from the cornmeal on top - good enough to eat on its own - Sundried tomato: tasty and tangy   -  Challah twist: pillowy soft with a hint of sweetness   Ah Simply Bread...  simply delicious...',4
'Some say its not really a lake well I dont think of the sandy areas of Michigan Lake as beaches in Chicago either but at least its a place where theres water in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  I love rollerblading in the mornings around the lake and taking strolls in the evening especially in the fall.  One can even kayak or sail on the lake too. The light rail is close by therefore if you are coming for Downtown Phoenix you can hop on the train and travel to the lake and surrounding areas.  Its very clean and theres lots of festivals and events that happen here year round.  Definitely a place to visit if its your first time in Phoenix.',5
'We were seriously overdue for updating our estate plan so when we received a mailer from Cholewka Law on the subject I set it aside. When the time was right I contacted the office and got an appointment within a week. Becky and Whitney were so thorough and helpful and dare I say fun? We are very confident in our new Trust and how it is tailored to fit our particular needs. It is such a stress reliever knowing that our childrens well being is provided for with no legal loose ends.  Our boys are young adults so we scheduled time at our signing to have a family meeting. Becky said few people take advantage of this but I would highly recommend it. She gave them an explanation of how a Trust works the specifics of our plan why we made the decisions we did etc. I know that when the time comes they will feel comfortable contacting the office to get assistance and I am very confident that they will be treated with kindness patience and respect.  If you are near Gilbert and looking for a great family lawyer  I would highly recommend Cholewka Law.',5
'We were seated over a half an hour after our resevation to start. The apps were great dates in bacon were amazing as was the flatbread. The entered however were not as good. My fish was so salty I felt my blood pressure spike! Even the salad that came on the side was too salty to eat. I have never spoken up about something like that before but it was do bad I had to. They seemed concerned asked if I wanted to order something else but I was done at that point. I was stunned that they didnt comp something on our bill they still charged us- not even a wine comp. I wasnt going to force the issue but wont go back.',3
'Im a fan of Vietnamese food and am happy to have a modern new Vietnamese restaurant downtown. I went for lunch and had the Mi Quang (Quang-Nam noodles with shrimp and vegies) and Gon Cuon (Vietnamese spring rolls). The noodle dish was good--very fresh tasting and was made even better with the addition of some Siracha sauce. The spring rolls and dipping sauce were delicious as served. The food was reasonably priced for a sit down restaurant. The service was efficient and friendly. I will definitely return for a workday lunch--there were a number of dishes served to people sitting near me that looked and smelled yummy.',4
'Being the nice Jewish girl that I am I love good Jewish food.  Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food.  Its not the greatest deli I have eaten at BUT I think its the most authentic deli that the valley has to offer!   The portions are huge wide selection of food deserts and deli cases.  They also offer Holiday dinners for those of you who may be Jewish and not have family out here to celebrate those holidays with.  I reccomend it!  They are quite expensive tho!',4
'I took a hot air balloon ride with Unicorn Balloon at sunrise on a Saturday morning.  The experience was really cool and I especially enjoyed it since it was my first ballooning experience.  My group had purchased Groupons for this trip and we had no trouble redeeming them.  The process is pretty easy- you meet them and they drive you in a van to the launch location and youre dropped off in the same place they picked you up.  The entire trip lasts about 4 hours with one hour of flight time. I thought this was the perfect amount of time as I was ready to come down by the end.  The desert scenery was beautiful and our pilot Captain Bubba seemed very experienced and was entertaining.  Although the basket seemed small to fit 12 people this ended up not being an issue and the ride was comfortable.    My only concern was our landing- apparently the people who were supposed to follow us and help us land were filling out our ballooning certificates so they were late.  We pretty much crashed into the ground bounced up and crashed back down a few times.  Luckily everyone was okay but this should not have happened.  You are also provided with a champagne breakfast after landing.',4
'I love the beet salad and date milkshakes. Food is really good and love the atmosphere. Tons of outdoor seating under huge trees. Another good place for big groups and or bringing kids.',5
'I love this place. It has the perfect lunch portions atmosphere and menu. I think it would be hard to find a better place for lunch. Yum!',5
'If youre in Tempe or Phoenix I HIGHLY recommend Pita Jungle - one of my favorite restaurants of all time - heathy tasty & amazing!   Get the Mediterranean Sampler Platter & some kind of chicken! The food & ambience turned a pouting 12yr old into a happy kid again: and I think thats about the most amazing thing you can say about food.  We split the Mediterranean Sampler Platter Chicken over Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus (YUM! Its in the pics - looks like chicken over guacamole) 4 drinks and fed this family of 4 for $33!  Cant beat that at a great restaurant!!! Love love love this place - been coming since there was just the Tempe location on Apache back in the mid-90s. The service is EXCELLENT!',5
'Oh Fate.  Why do you have to be so unaccommodating?  First of all finding Fate takes some work.  When we turned off the main road we wondered if we were completely lost since it didnt look like the kind of neighborhood you would find a restaurant it was very residential.  As we drove by it my husband actually thought it was an abandoned building.  There is a small parking lot off to the left that fits about 5 cars or so. The inside of the restaurant is pretty cool with exposed brick and local funky artwork.  We went with a rather large group of 12.  One of the girls made a reservation ahead of time and they nicely set up a long table for the 12 of us.  (Note: long table not conducive to talking when in a large group)  About 8 of us arrived all at the same time but were told that we needed the whole party to be seated.  Its a small place and the 8 of us just standing in the door next to the table was a little awkward to say the least; especially considering there was only one other party dining at the time.  We stood and waited around until finally they told us we could sit down.  The food price is very reasonable and the selection is Pan-Asian leaning heavily towards Thai.  We each placed our orders and one of the members of our party asked to have half of her entree boxed up before it even got to the table.  They couldnt do that.  They gave her a take out box and she had to do it herself.  How hard is it for them to just put half of it aside?  The food was pretty good however and I enjoyed my Thai coconut curry.  All in all the whole experience was unremarkable bordering on frustrating.  The food wasnt nearly good enough to justify the poor service- although our waitress suddenly became very accommodating and friendly when we handed her cash + 4 credit cards and told her we were giving her a $50 tip on a $200 check.  Maybe we should have told her that when we had gotten there!',3
'Quaint place.  The coffee here has skyrocketed in the last year with the hiring of some better baristas and the use of better coffee.  This was our place to frequent in the Mesa area and left something to be desired in the past - now its little less than a go-to place worth the trip.  Great eats here too.  The owners are incredibly friendly and are always open to a good conversation.',5
'I hate giving local restaurants bad reviews but this place is in need of some major improvements. I also dont see this so much as a bad review but a critique that will hopefully help the owners make some changes. I wish more business owners would read their reviews and try to take them to heart.   We went there on a Saturday afternoon and were the only customers. It feels a little depressing when you walk inside. The space is big but unfortunately doesnt have a good vibe to it. The walls are in extreme need of a fresh coat of paint and the bench covers are all ripped and fixed with ducked tape. Music comes from a radio with a lot of advertisement. It just doesnt feel good to be there...   As far as food goes I think most people would compare this to Genghis Grill where meat is fresher and the sauce and seasoning selection is much larger. Shredded frozen meat just doesnt look that appetizing. Maybe they are just trying to cut costs on all the wrong places.   Price is a little too high in my opinion especially considering the location of the restaurant and the quality of the ingredients. Then also please if you are the manager and are reading this get rid of the 75 cents for the to go box. It just seems unreasonable to pay to take food home that you have already paid for. I understand and know that a lot of all you can eat places have a policy that doesnt allow to take left overs home and that is reasonable. However if you only pay for one bowl you should be able to get a to go bag for free. Obviously this has upset customers in the past and I just think that 75 cents arent just worth losing a customer.',3
'The service was horrible the breakfast menu only had 4 basic ingredients and the employees could not understand what we were asking most likely due to a language barrier. The eggs and bacon were just bad. I would rather have gone to mcdonalds honestly. The food was put in styrofoam boxes even though we planned on dining in. I was hoping to have a nice morning breakfast with my boyfriend but this place just did not live up to the appearance given by the website.   I will give them that their frappes were good but that was about it. They were about the same price as starbucks.   Overall it was a horrible experience. If your in the area and want breakfast just go get an egg mcmuffin at mcdonalds down the street it has more flavor and they have better coffee.',1
'Best bartender in the world Jesse.  Had several items on the menu and never been disappointed. Always got shrimp and cheddar blt..got shrimp canape omg..blew my socks off.  Best place in the area by far!!!',5
'barrio cafe is the best mexican restaurant that mexicans never go to which is too bad for my people because theyre missing out. best thing ive had there is the cochinita pibil. when youre waiting for your table (always a long wait) at the bar (always crowded) order an icy cold michelada with extra chipotle tabasco. mmmmmmmm.  addendum: - attention mexican-americans: barrio cafe serves food that is VERY similar to what is served in nice restaurants in southern mexico. just because there are white people eating at barrio cafe doesnt mean that its not real mexican food. and just because youve never heard of most of the dishes on the menu says more about your level of exposure to mexican food than it does about the restaurant. - attention non-mexicans: yes mexicans IN MEXICO eat fries. no rice and beans are NOT served with every meal IN MEXICO. and im not talking about rocky point or cabo. im talking about MEXICO. in fact rice and beans on the same plate is usually only seen in the US. - attention burrito eaters: stay away. this place is too fancy for you. dont waste your money. you wouldnt appreciate the food here anyway. - attention everyone: yes barrio cafe is expensive but so are most nice restaurants. just because youre used to eating $6.99 combo plates doesnt mean that all mexican food is like that.  please everyone understand that the mexican food that is served in 99% of the restaurants in texas arizona and california is VERY different from what people actually eat in the country of mexico. dont go to barrio cafe expecting anything like what you normally eat.  honestly im just shocked at all the comments about how barrio cafe isnt authentic.',5
'Ben here a few times for lunch. Its in a tiny strip mall and parking can be an issue. We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been very good. A large usually will feed two of us.. gluttony definately takes over while your here and you have to remember to control yourself :)',4
'Thats a Wrap turns me into a vegetarian nearly every time I go. And I get hit on by hipster waitresses. I also cant believe Ive never reviewed this place until now.  What do I love about Thats a Wrap? Everything. The people are awesome. The space is extremely laid back and inviting. They have jameson and ginger ale on their limited cocktail menu. They have homemade lemonade. They pretty much have homemade everything. And I hardly ever get the same thing every time I go.   Thats a Wrap knows exactly what to do to please me.  The Tarragon and the Veggie Jackson are probably tied for my favorites. Ive always wanted to try the carrot cake but Im deathly afraid Ill love it too much.  When I was in a few weeks ago it took abou 20 minutes for my to go order and to make it up to me my next one was on the house. Because this place is awesome.',5
'Burritos are extremely good and the pastries are awsome.......especially with a cup of a hot beverage.  I especially like the flauta with cheese or flauta with cajeta.   Nothing like grabbing a green burrito mexican pepsi and then a flauta to for a business lunch.  Ive taking a few of my collegues here and they have loved it as well.',5
'Look I realize its not cool to admit you like CPK. Im OK with that because they have one of the most crave-worthy salads ever: the tricolore salad composed of spring mix and arugula with a light vinaigrette huge pieces of shaved Parmesan and chunks of tomato all served on a warm Parmesan-encrusted pizza crust. I think the whole thing really defeats the purpose of a salad but the hell with it. Finish off the gluttony with their flourless chocolate cake served warm with vanilla bean goo on top. OMG heaven.',4
'For years my husband and I have been saying we want to try Donovans but never got around to it until last month. It was our 11 year wedding anniversary and we had made reservations at another upscale restaurant. After asking for an outdoor table on 4 separate occasions they tried to seat us indoors.  Then told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait for the patio. We decided not to patronize the nameless restaurant but were now left in a jam. It was our anniversary a Saturday night at 8:00 and we had comedy tickets for 9:30. We called Donovans on a whim and were immediately delighted by their customer service.  Within 15 minutes they prepared a cozy booth for us and had red rose petals on the table. The waiter was aware of our time crunch and went above and beyond to expedite a delicious meal. My husband had the large filet cooked perfectly and augratin potatoes. Just a side note: Donovans is one of the very few local steakhouses that serves Prime cuts of meat. And that higher quality makes all the difference! I had an iceberg wedge salad and a side of asparagus. Which were perfect for this super picky eater. Finally they presented us with a sensational creme brûlée with a candle in it.  Bottom line: Great food excellent service and attention to detail. They put the other restaurant we were supposed to go to TO SHAME!',5
'The reviews do not lie.  Every time we walk into this Lowes we are greeted and ALWAYS asked if we need any help.  There is a Home Depot right across the street that we have given a chance a few times.  They just dont compare to the great customer service right across the street at Lowes.  We have a filter for our fridge that we HAVE to get at Home Depot because Lowes does not sell it but rest assured that is the only reason why we will ever go to Home Depot again.  Lowes is our place!',5
'Food  - 2/5  Food was below-average at best. My steak tasted like it had freezer burn on the edges of the steak or like it had been microwaved. The side salad was good I finished it but the veggie skewer was dry and the tomatos were old. My buddy did get the Southern Fried Fish and Chips (Catfish) and it looked pretty good and most everyone else at the table seemed satisfied with what they received and thats the only reason I gave the food any credit.  Service - 3/5 Waitress despite forgetting my beer was nice she did use profanity when I mentioned she forgot my beer... I may have liked her more because of that tho.  Atmosphere - 3/5 Like most other Texas steakhouses it was loud but I could hear the other 6 friends I was with which was nice.  Price - 2/5 Based on the quality of the food I could have gone somewhere else and spend $20 for a ribeye and veggie skewer and been much happier. Drink specials were good and apparently they dont get much during the week because they have the big vinyl sign promoting 2 meals for $14.99 Mon - Wed.  Overall - You can find a better steakhouse in most strip malls probably even the one Logans Roadhouse is in...',2
'Great stadium! One of the nicest Spring Training complexes in AZ!',5
'Perfect marriage of Mouth-Watering deliciousness that I crave for!   Garlic Shrimp (requested it to be prepared traditional extra Thai hot) is my absolute favorite here. Yum!!    Service always great.  Owners and cooks always preparing my food perfectly hot & spicy!  Thai coffee is fab; and even the glass of water is refreshing with a slice of cucumber.',5
'Found the glasses Ive been trying to find for several months. They told me it would be a week or more before the frames arrived - it was two days. Told me the same for the frames with the lenses - it was probably three days. I was very pleased! For some reason I think I paid less here than I did for my first set of frames that came from Costco which is hard to believe I think.',4
'This place has something for everyone - from mexican to traditional english greek and indian. The food is more than filling the price is very reasonable for what you get and the staff is friendlier than most places Ive been. They serve good beer and serve $3 car bombs all the time - if you dont like the food its easy to drink until you do. Its not very spacious but that adds to the charm - you may spend up to 15 minutes waiting for a 2-top but Ive never really minded the wait. The soundtrack is better than any youre going to find - I recently ate my Bangers and Mash while listening to Clarence Carter - Strokin. This quickly devolved into a singalong for several of us something I would be surprised to find out happens quite often here. Ive heard some people say that their pasties arens as good as other places but I doubt that these others have the variety and consistent quality that the Cornish has. The salads served here are of exceptional quality as well.  The only problem Ive come across here is that the pasties are pre-made meaning that special requests (no mushrooms extra meat etc) cannot be honored. Usually this does not present a problem but it is something to be aware of.',5
'We have given this place a handful of chances over the years but we still have mixed feelings about it. We live nearby and would love a fun place to walk to so we keep giving it more chances. Our experience:  1. The service has always been good. Waitresses are very friendly and service is good. The atmosphere is fun too.   2. The food is OK. Flatbreads are good but if you have ever been to Postinos do not get your hopes up for the bruschetta- its very small and uneventful. They may want to step it up a notch.   Overall its not a bad place. They need to just step it up on some of the food based on the price you pay for it.',3
'If you go out for the decor this is not the place for you.  But if you like good comfort food at a very reasonable price this is an excellent place for that.  The salad bar was very fresh.  I was a little afraid but when I got there the lettuce was crisp and all the ingredients were properly kept.  I ordered the pot roast which was awesome.  The wait staff was very friendly.  I am not impressed easily but this place was exceptional.  I would definitely return.  I have eaten in alot of places in Phoenix and have not been moved most of the time but this place is a great place for someone who love a nice meal and is not watching their weight.  The banana cream pie was awesome.  A pound of pie with fresh cream and fresh banana.',5
'This is the worst place for delivery!  They put you on hold for close to 5 min when you call then it takes well over an hour to deliver the food (we live less than 5 miles away). The food is decent but not worth the hassle of having it delivered.',1
'On Sunday I made my way up to Cave Creek to go hiking and found myself in one of the loveliest settings Ive seen in a while. The reserve is endless there are loads of trails of varying distances and difficulties and all are clearly laid out on the free map provided at the entrance. My cousin and I made our way up the Tortuga trail to get a clear view of Elephant Mountain and then along the first half of the Spur Cross Trail. There was a HUGE group of hikers whod arrived just before us and we found out that rangers offer free guided hikes throughout the reserve. The group was testing out the newly opened Dragonfly Trail which branches off Spur Cross and heads southwest.   Cave Creek is verdant this time of year which is a stark contrast to what Ive seen in East Scottsdale lately and I even saw some new plants I couldnt identify. And on our way back down the Spur Cross trail we spotted a gila monster (see photos) and it was totally scary and rad all at the same time. I will definitely be back to explore more of this reserve this spring!',5
'Purchased food using a Group On. First was impressed with the staff. They provided great and fast service for the amount of food we purchased. Picked up food for 18 people. The food was excellent and great tasting. We covered the majority of meats they had to offer. The BBQ wasnt overly smokey which tends to happen at many places. Definitely will come back here for BBQ. Great place if you are getting good for a large group.',4
'Bottom Line - Rapid Collision Center 1.) Performed work to vehicle without prior approval 2.) Lied about receiving approval from my insurance company for the additional work 3.) Failed to communicate needed information to me in a timely manner 4.) Failed to communicate with adjuster about additional repairs in a timely manner 5.) Poor work done  I brought my vehicle to Rapid Collision Center for repairs from a front-end collision.  They properly had an adjuster from my insurance company come out and approve certain repairs to my vehicle.  While they were preforming the work they discovered additional repairs would be needed and decided to preform the additional repairs WITHOUT having prior approval from the adjuster.  I hadnt heard from them by the date they originally told me my vehicle would be ready so I called to find out how things were going.  This is when they told me that they needed to complete more work and would need additional time.  A few more days pass with no communication from them.  I again call them to find out what is taking so long and I am informed that my vehicle has been completely repaired but they are waiting for the additional work that they had already done to be approved by the insurance company.  I called my adjuster at this point to see how long it would take to get approval.  My adjuster informed me that he hadnt even heard from Rapid Collision Center about any additional needed repairs!!  I called Rapid Collision Center back immediately and they said that they were about to contact him.  A few more days pass and I call again to find out if the repairs have been approved yet at which point Nate tells me that yes the insurance company has approved the repairs.  He suggested that I come in and pay for the additional repairs and have my insurance company pay me back instead of them since the repairs had been approved.  This was a LIE!  My insurance company had only approved part of the additional cost not the total.  I called as soon as I found this out and they apologized and told me that they would be glad to refund me the difference if my insurance company didnt reimburse me after they submit it to them again.  Well they submitted it again and again and they were denied again and again.  I sent a letter requesting the promised refund - no response.  It doesnt rain very often in Arizona but when the next large rain storm came through water leaked in and completely soaked the passenger side of the vehicle.  At this point there was no way I would go back to Rapid Collision Center to address their poor workmanship.  I found a different repair shop down the street and explained my dilemma to them.  The man took a look at my vehicle told me what he thought the problem was and fixed it for me.  He charged me for parts only!  Please please please do not use Rapid Collision Center!  When I was speaking to my adjuster he even told me that this company was one of the worst he has ever had to deal with!',1
'After seeing Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena I was still in the mood for dessert. (See my Gordon Biersch review.)  I walked through the Westgate Center after the show and decided to give Yard House a try. Perused the menu outside and decided that the desserts looked good.  Went in and was promptly seated at a nice big booth for just one person. The hostess asked if Id ever been there before and I told her no. She briefly explained the menu for me.   When the server arrived he also asked if Id ever been there before. I told him no and he went over the menu again. I didnt want him wasting his time so I told him I was just interested in dessert. He pointed out the dessert section and I asked him if he recommended the pint-sized apple peach cobbler. He said he did but warned me it was small....hence the pint-sized disclaimer. I thought that was cool....some menus say pint-sized but he wanted to make sure I understood they meant it. Honesty goes a long way with me.  I said that was fine....thats all I wanted and really needed. He asked if I wanted anything to drink and I told him Id look over the HUGE beer list.   When he came back I asked him his preference between two beers. I took his suggestion with the Murphys Irish Red and really enjoyed it.   The pint-sized cobbler was small...as he had warned...but it was tasty. The caramel ice cream it was served with was a welcome touch over the traditional vanilla.  Beer and a cobbler.....strange I know.....but it worked.   The ambiance of the place was casual and laid back with lots of televisions everywhere and lots of classic rock (like their slogan says).  Would like to try some of the food next time Im in the Westgate area.   Oh.....the sinks in the mens room were awesome. Or I guess I should say sink in the singular. It was a long trough with three or four spigots. You put your hand up to the spigot and a STRONG stream of water about two or three inches wide came out.  Made washing your hands pretty darn cool. Its the first time in a LONG time that Ive felt I got all the soap off my hands in a public restroom.  A great and relaxing end to my evening out. Will be back.',4
'Best Food Ever. The giant glasses of Strongbow are a plus as well. Love the staff too :) I even had my 25th Birthday party here!',5
'I had a nice experience in this hotel. I had to stay for a work conference for three days and two nights. They were friendly and courteous and it was easy to check in and out. No hassles.  In the nice rooms there was a little bag with complimentary ear plugs an eyemask lavendar sheet spritzer and also a CD that you can listen to to help you fall asleep easier! That was new for me! The bathrooms had granite countertops and were very clean.  I received two dozen red roses from my husband while I was visiting (well its not like I wasnt going to announce this to the world right?!) and they brought them up to my room with big smiles. It was so sweet! I couldnt take them all with me so I left them with the front desk who thanked me profusely and happily arranged them in the lobby. I kept one to take home with me and it just barely survived the trip!  The food and conference service was nice. They served us a full breakfast on the first morning and a continental on the second/last morning. The lunches were buffet style also and were sandwiches and salads the first day and a Mexican spread the second day. All were quite tasty. Especially the Mexican food!   The one downside is that there were  150 of us and there was never enough bottled water put out. It would be gone in half an hour and not to be replenished until after the next meal. since I dont drink sodas and coffee only in the morning that meant that I had to keep getting up with my plastic cup and refilling with water at the water kegs they had in the back which can get disruptive when you have seventy or so people doing that.  Also the air was kept quite cool so that I was shivering half the time. Id look around and even some of the men were cold. Thats saying something. Were in Phoenix in the fall and yes its hot out but inside should be kept at a normal temperature around 70-72 degrees right? It was about 65. Brrr!  Their shuttle service was efficient and friendly also. The lounge was smoky and dark as most lounges are but the service was also friendly there.   All in all it was a very pleasant experience! I would recommend any one to stay here if theyre in the area. Its not luxury but its clean up to date and friendly!',4
'EXCELLENT THAI FOOD. period. atmosphere is very soothing.',4
'Went in for a friends birthday last night. The food drinks and our server were amazing and if it were not for the unfortunate experience with the management staff I would have highly suggested this place to anyone. Because we had a larger party they had explained while making the reservation that they could only do one check but would take multiple forms of payment. When the check arrived we went through and wrote down what items went on which card so the server would easily be able run each card for whatever the total would have been. A few minutes later the manager comes back sets the cards back on the table with a calculator and says that they were not going to do the math for us and to figure it out ourselves. After we did I approached the managers again to explain how unprofessional and rude that was given they have computers that could have easily done the math for them had they not chosen to be lazy. They went on to tell me that they were very clear when we made the reservation that they were not going to split the check...which was not what we were asking them to do when asking them to do some basic math. They went on to tell me how lucky we were that they even got our size group in on such short notice. (*Bear in mind we had 12 people at 10pm...there was so much room in the restaurant we could have been a walk-in party and they would have easily been able to get us right in even without a reservation.) I have worked in the restaurant industry for the last 5 years and when I explained that in my experience I had never worked at or been to a restaurant that would ever toss a calculator on a table and tell the guests to figure it out themselves the woman said she encouraged me to eat at those other restaurants then. Im giving it 2 stars because the food and drinks were good but dont waste your time at this place if you dont want to deal with lazy rude management.',2
'Just a so- so place. To many other places with better food  for your $$$.',3
'This place really is as good as it gets.  The food is spectacular the fried rice is amazing and we always get the filet and it truly is melt in your mouth.  Great fun and close to home.  The east valley is lucky to have Osaka here!!  Go check it out',5
'Had dinner on the patio with live music last night and breakfast there this morning.  I have to say many of the bad reviews really piss me off.  Good food takes time people!  If you want fast and cheap go to  McDs across the parking lot. The food here is better than anything else in Ahwatukee.  I dont mind waiting and the servers are relaxed and friendly.   Dont change a thing!  If the people who dont like it here stop coming more great food and atmosphere for the rest of us.',5
'Great Food Amazing staff!',5
'This is more of a review of our waiter than the restaurant and hes probably gone by now but Ill post it anyway. We ate here on a date night a while ago after a strenuous rock climbing outing at Phoenix Rock Gym. Say what you want about Olive Garden but the food I order is consistently good. It may not be holy crap...that was amazing but I never have a bad dish either. We had the chicken parmesan which was big enough to split which we always do. Couple that with the complimentary salad and breadsticks and it makes a filling meal. Now on to our server Montique. He was very attentive and humorous from the start to the finish. He never let our drinks sit empty he was always asking if there was anything else he could do to make our meal better and he gave us good recommendations for the dessert. After quickly finishing our dessert he asked if we liked it. I jokingly said that I thought we needed another piece to fully evaluate the taste. He laughed and returned a few minutes later with another piece of cake which he said was on the house. How cool is that! Hopefully he hangs around as he is definitely an asset to this restaurant. Well return simply because of the service we were given by Montique.',4
'Sam is very friendly when you understand hes just not a typical back slapper. I cant understand the concern regarding selection his selection of upper grade cigars is excellent. He doesnt carry junk low quality stuff.   Prices are in line for a retail store. Example: rocky Patel decade toro 10.49. Very reasonable. 10.60 online.   To me a very good cigar store. 5 stars.',5
'Had some late afternoon meetings here this week and enjoyed the place.  It could use a bike rack which actually isnt a quibble any more.  Had a baked brie-based appetizer one day and shared an antipasto the next.  Roasted peppers and sun dried tomatos - delicious.  Breads - very good.  Pesto - rich.  Service - attentive allowed us to linger for hours during the tween time.  Another non-quibble - the coffee is boring.  Overall Carlys deserves fan-hood based on these two experiences.',4
'This is my first yelp review.  I like to read what other people have to say but never really thought to voice my own opinion until I was looking for a new dentist and wished there were more helpful comments.  SO I hope this helps someone who is looking for a good OB/GYN. I was referred to Dr. Eckel by my primary physician when I was 18 years old (11 years ago).  He is very knowledgeable and professional and I have always felt very comfortable with him.  He delivered my son in 2010 and everything went perfectly!  Even though I have since moved 30 minutes away from the South Scottsdale office I still go there for my annual visit and I plan to continue going when we decide to have another baby.  I sometimes see one of the female nurse practitioners (Wendy or Nancy) for my annual exam and they are awesome too.',5
'Excellent pizza though they screwed up the order. The manager came and apologized and the made a corrected pizza. Only it took about 40 minutes and they charged for it.  Rather tacky!  Notes: Dont go here in a hurry or with any other plans Repeat your order several times The wait for a table will be longer than committed',3
'Met my wife there for lunch on a week day.  We got there right as they opened because they fill up pretty fast.  The music inside was way too loud.  Practically had to shout to have a conservation.  The burgers were ok you could tell the meat was fresh.  If you like Wendys burgers youll like this place.  A bit pricey over $20 for two burgers one order of fries (huge serving feeds 2) and 2 sodas.  Again burgers arent bad just not worth the price.',2
'Holy cow (may he rest in peace) they make a good burger!  Now I can eat a 6 pound burrito without taking a breath but theres something about burgers where my appetite suffers.  I love a good burger but about halfway through I fall apart.  The meat just makes me sick.  I end up throwing it out and eating the bun.  Not at Smashburger.  I can order a small Smash and eat every last bite and still want more!  And their fries are among the best out there.  Im not sure what there isnt to like about it.  I guess Ill have to find an excuse to head to Marketplace this weekend and see if I can find something.',4
'The reviews do not disappoint!  My colleague and I came in on a Monday night and had a fabulous meal. To begin with the Margaritas are fabulous! My colleague had the Stacked Enchiladas which I took a bite of as well and they were divine. I had a hard time deciding and ended up with the Ocean Front which was also very good. To be honest we could have eaten here every day and not run out of choices.   The staff was really friendly the atmosphere casual and there was a nice outdoor patio as well. It was a bit windy the night we were there so we stayed inside. March is a great time of year to visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!  Enjoy!',4
'This is the first time weve been there since they went all organic. The menu isnt as obnoxiously large as it was before (HUGE bonus!) but the food is just as good. We tried the whole wheat crust but our taste buds didnt like it too much. I love that there are options for those who are vegans gluten free etc. There is pretty much something for everyone. The pizza is not bad but you definitely have to be in the mood to try something new especially if you are new to the foodie world like I am.   We started with the spinach/artichoke dip. Highly recommend it! It comes in an edible bread bowl with slices of pita celery and carrots. The dip was good with all four options.   There were only two servers on at the time and the place was busy! We still never waited for a refill on drinks. We will be back.',4
'Ive always found large portions to be unappealing as my taste buds  hit the plateau of diminishing returns usually after 3 bites.  Stax solves that problem by offering 3oz sliders around $4-$5 and tons of choices for customizing them.    The Moroccan Colorado lamb and the good ol beef burger were nicely charred and full of flavor.  The sweet potato fries at $3.75 was not only delicious but a great deal given the generous serving.  The garlic aioli goes great with it.    I appreciated the no pressure service.  Even though between the two of us we only ordered a slider each and shared one order of fries the server was cool with it.',4
'We frequent this place as it is down the street from our business and its always amazingly good. I placed a to-go order it was waiting for me right on time. I had a co-worker call and order last minute while I was picking up. While I was waiting for the additional food the manager (I assume) made sure I had a complimentary drink along with chips and salsa. She also rushed my additional order and I was out the door ASAP. Excellent service and delicious food. Perfect!',5

My coffee order was up and I have to say Im pleased with the presentation very swanky and the latte itself was good the creamy froth stayed though out the entire drink you know how sometimes it fades away not here it was frothy creamy all the way to the last drop.

'I love the fact that it doesnt seem weird that there is an auto showroom next to the Sunglass Hut in the Fashion Square Mall and that the car salesmen look more like they belong at the Genius Bar at the Apple Store than in an auto showroom.  There is a $122K Model S sitting in the showroom for you to sit in (gorgeous tons of leg room but limited headroom) but if you want to test drive it you need to get your name on a list. Tesla brings cars in once a quarter for all licensed interested parties to test drive.   The store is entirely green with absolutely no printed materials. The car ordering process itself is all electronic. The product specialist Braddon Deak with who we were talking was awesome and had an encyclopedic knowledge of all things Tesla.  Even if you cant afford the car they have tons of Tesla related merch to tide you over until you build the bank account.',5

My company uses the Ford transits and while most auto glass places didnt have the item since the transits were fairly new; Prime Auto Glass was still able to get it for us!

Lets just hope the freeway gods wont chuck another pebble at it anytime soon!    Overall great service fast and on time.  We all hate to deal with our car maintenance but companies like Prime Auto Glass just makes things smoother and easier on all of us! - Enjoy!',5
'I had decent expectations for this place because of the reviews that it has but I was sorely disappointed. I went there and ordered from the lunch special menu which is very limited.   My coworker got the sweet and sour chicken she said that it was good but the sauce was thick.  I got the crispy house chicken and the wor wonton soup. First the wor wonton soup only comes in large but I was willing to give it a chance. I shouldnt have. The soup lacked salt and had barely anything in it. Canton Dragon still has the best wor wonton soup I have ever had.   The chicken was far from crispy as it was completely overwhelmed in sauce and soggy by the time I got it back to work to eat. The fried rice was mushy and the egg roll was overcooked.   Maybe this was just a bad day but I wont be returning to the prime as Ive had much better Chinese food at a much better price.',2
'Scale of 1-10 (single visit): 6 Food 8 *Drinks* 5 Service 10 Atmosphere 4 Value  Holy shit thank god I had a Groupon for this one. As such note that the above 2-star rating is *generous*.  To start off on the good: The space is really really cute & comfortable.  The patio has lights and trellised flowers and the indoors is perfectly lit and just feels good.  The drinks were also really tasty and the service was pleasant.  However despite all the pleasantness in the world competence wasnt on the menu last night.  Among other things i expect servers to a) take my order correctly and b) know what menu items they are out of.  Well no such luck.  Strike 1: Our server had to go check with the bar to see which winter drinks they were no longer making.  It was 7:30pm.  Do that before your shift starts or maybe mgmt should update the menus even if its just with a sharpie.  Strike 2: He almost brought me the wrong drink.  The only reason he didnt is because of the extra trip he made to tell us which drinks were actually available.  Okay so Ill go put in your X and your Y [from his first trip] is in as well. -- Um I ordered a Z. -- Oh Ill go change that.  Strike 3: When the appetizer came out it didnt have the fried egg on top like we ordered.  It looked much different than I expected (which isnt a bad thing) so once I realized it was eggless the food runner was gone and 3 minutes passed and no sight of our server so we just ate it.  He apologized and didnt charge us for the egg which I dont expect took much effort because I doubt it was ever rung in in the first place.  Strike 4: After taking our food order he returned to the table to tell my girlfriend that they were out of the Fettuccine.  For the love of god know that shit *AT* the table!!  This turned out to be a problem because there arent many vegetarian options on their menu.  Which leads me to the food.  Why are there so few veggie options?  Im not a veggie but you should have a healthy selection of veggie options.  Some people need them and some people just want them.  After getting my food I was also amazed at how underwhelming it was considering the price.  People used to bitch that PastaBar was overpriced for what they got.  Have they ever been to Caffe Boa?  Caffe Boas food was less filling less flavorful and more expensive than PastaBars ever was.  The only exception was dessert: a Tangelo & Honey Twinkie.  This tasted excellent... but was still an astounding $9.  I was hoping that Caffe Boa would give me another reason to go to Mill which I enjoy the liveliness of but unfortunately not.  Thank god I had that Groupon....',2
'The decor has changed slightly since the Food Bar was in operation here.  I did like the openness that they have created and the fact that now I can sit order from a menu.  Of course with any new endeavor there are ideas that may work and concepts that dont.  For instance the idea of changing a classic French Onion Soup recipe leave it alone add salt the prerequisite cheese (not the style that Metro added).   The service was attentive but awkward (the logo company was still applying the lettering to the doors and windows) so maybe she was nervous and distracted?  I also ordered a field green salad with chicken and she said It doesnt come with chicken.  So pointing to the menu (3 or 4$ charge to add chicken)  Its printed here.  She replied  Oh I learned something new today.  Like I said new endeavors take time to cultivate and grow.  I will be back  -  enjoying a lunch on the patio with an order of oysters from the raw bar a glass of wine and time to soak it all in.   Everyone deserves a second chance.',3
'Ok so I spring a surprise on my gal and make a reservation for 630pm outside so we can listen to the entertainment.  We are seated outside for the piano man and our waitress explains we can participate in the wine tasting that evening great!!! We order she gets the swordfish and I get the flatiron steak and we go to the wine tasting!!! We each taste about 4 or 5 wines and have some small talk.   We get to the table and our food arrives well it looks good.  Yes my flatiron steak is super and the asparagus is my fave.  all in a bed of fries.  My girls swordfish is rapidly disappearing must be good. We finish off the meal with crème brulee and coffee. Absolutely perfect night with my baby!',5
'Your only excuse for not going here immediately is that they dont have their liquor license yet but hopefully by March 19.  The patio the waiters and the chef are all delightful though the latter speaks little English.  Almost all food items are under $10 with salad.  The dinner crepes are the best Ive had in Scottsdale.  If crepes arent your thing try the Flammelcueche (like a thin-crust pizza).  I recommend the classical.  If thats too much for you to eat try the quiche or the baguettes or the croques tartines or the sandwiches or the salads.  Or eat completely out of the box with a crosty (stuffed baked potato).',5
'I had forgotten to write a review after going to a game here for the first time.  We moved out here a year ago from Northern California and being Giants fans had heard great things about spring training and the reports were true.  We had gone to the As Stadium a couple of days earlier and this place blew away the As stadium.  I dont even know where to start.  First food and beverage vendors were amazing.  The amount of choices made it hard to figure out what to eat.  I ended up going with a teriyaki bowl and it was delicious.  The park itself is beautiful and has a similar feel to AT&T park back in SF (which is the best ballpark that Ive ever been).  We got lawn seats and have to say that was quite an experience.  It was an absolute sea of people out there.  There were plenty of beer/soda/water etc vendors out there so we were well hydrated in the warm sun.  I really cant say enough about the experience.  I am really looking forward to next year and will have to go to a couple of games next year for sure.',5
'Delish!  Coffee fresh squeezed orange juice pancakes French toast eggs & bacon - check check & check!  All were amazing and fresh.  Prices were really reasonable especially for the freshness and quality.  It was worth the drive from N. Phx - will go again as soon as we can so many things Im dying to try!',5
'I stayed here on a recent trip to Phoenix. This was my second time staying at a Drury hotel. It was consistent with my stay at a Drury property in Greesnboro NC.   Here is my only negative observation. The business center computers are obviously running an older version of IE. I was not able to view files on my SkyDrive to open and print some documents.   More importantly the room and bed were comfortable. The breakfast was good also.',4
'One word..... Awesome!!! I consistently go here. Good is amazing and price is good!',5
'Stopped in with my boy when we went to the pizza place next door.  Got to say the cookies were OUTSTANDING and we really enjoyed the treat!  Prices were reasonable and they had a number of other treats that we did not get a chance to try yet including cupcakes.  Short story per my son try the chocolate explosion cookie.  (To me it seemed more like a brownie) He raved about it and really enjoyed it so I know it was good.  I had a white chocolate chip cookie square and it was pretty darn good.  Good enough I want one again.  : )',5
'Food is just okay but it is to expensive for what you get.',2
'This place is now called Lorenas Cafe so Im assuming the food and other general information on the old listing is going to be incorrect; and as such the older reviews are no longer relevant.  This place isnt the best Mexican food Ive ever had but its certainly not the worst. Its authentic cheap fast and open at 6am so you cant really beat that especially considering that there arent many places to eat in this area at that hour. I work next door so I am here almost everyday so its definitely worth coming back to if its convenient :)',3
'I LOVED The Parlor.   I didnt love the very-full parking lot but I guess when you have food this good its a given that parking may be an issue.  My friend and I both  had the carrot-ginger soup which was excellent. I had the small cesear salad and my friend had the tuna melt and like it alot. Both excellent!  I am going to try the pizza some day soon (I try to NOT eat pizza because I love it and will eat it way too often) and will update at that time. The pizza menu looks wonderful by the way.  Our  waiter was very nice the food was served quickly and the prices were average for a nice place such as this.  All in all The Parlor is a winner!',5
'The food was outstanding. The people who work there are so nice and accomodating. Everybody was very friendly. I highly recommend going there.',5
'Copenhagen runs a full-blown outlet next to their warehouse. If you want to go Danish modern / contemporary and save some cash check it out.   The space is big. Theres usually a good mix of couches bookcases and rugs. The inventory is floor samples or returns. Condition ranges from needs-some-TLC to pristine. In my experience sofas tend to be in the best shape.   A few things:  - Im 99% sure its closed on Sunday. - Ive never seen any of the accessories or higher-end office furniture that they have in the Camelback showroom. - Copenhagen has a minimum delivery charge ($100 I believe). Buy multiple items or bribe a pickup-owning friend with lunch at Pepes Taco Villa. - It might be hard to find in the Grand Avenue labyrinth of doom. Direct yourself to a point just southwest of the 43rd Ave. Home Depot and youre in.',4
'What to say about Foxtails? You are going to a salon so its not going to be $8 for someone fresh out of an 8 hour seminar and what a difference that makes.  A great example: Ive been getting some haircuts Id been happy with and recently Jude made a recommendation on a different style when I said I wanted to go shorter than Id been getting it cut. It was really short almost shorter than I think we talked about but now a week later its coming in really well just as she assured me. Also I did some color late last summer and despite the blonding up of my light brown hair I didnt look like a complete D Bag. Which is fine line to walk when blonding up the hair for the summer.  Jude is fun and so is her sister Candy. They were playing some music the other day and when Elliot Smith came on and reminded me of my Ex since she really is just Somebody That I Used To Know they kindly changed it.  Definitely going to be returning to Foxtails but probably not for more than a month. The cuts I get grow out really well better than those Super/Great Haircuts.  Hurray!',5
'This Keg was A-OK. Was here during early part of December to help celebrate a colleagues 40th birthday.  Drinks were well-made (how could you mess up a Grey Goose and Diet Coke?) as well as the apps (nachos and bruschetta). I didnt eat dinner but birthday girl had a well-done steak and it smelled/looked fab.  All in all - great place to dine and eat/drink! Im just not a huge fan of chains - it makes me squirm a bit. Bathrooms were pretty modern/oversized and just a nice place to powder your nose.',4
'4 stars is the perfect way to describe Taggia. It reaches for 5 star perfection but just doesnt quite make it. Tthere are so many random intangible things that are keeping it from being a 5 star joint but I cant put my finger on it. Anyway this place is pretty damn good.  The service was very friendly and nice. What impressed me is the support staff. Everyone from the hostess to the bussers to the food runners went out of their way to be over-the-top nice accomodating and attentive. I swear - no less than THREE seperate managers came by to ask us if everything was to our satisfaction. While some might find this annoying I found it refreshing. Most managers - as Eminem might say just dont give a fuck.  But at Taggia they DO give a fuck so yay.  Also the food was surprisingly good. Why do I write surprisingly? Because something about the place screamed this food is going to suck. But it didnt!  It was excellent.   The pre-dinner bread is awesome. Not just oh great. bread type of good bread. Its large chucks of nuts and fresh baked kind of good bread.  The burrata - a caprese type dish with arugula speck and Taggiasche olive pesto was INSANE. Eat this. Its offbeat and delish.  Props to the chef for offering a varity of pasta dishes without cream sauce. All the pasta choices looked good to me. I had a difficult time choosing. But the one I chose... HOLLA!  I had mushroom ravioli topped with asparagus and dungeness crab. The mushroom ravioli was DOUBLE INSANE - and possibly one of the best ravs I ever had. However - and this is part of the 4 star-not-5-star part  - While the crab asparagus mix was good - it wasnt nearly as good as the ravioli. It was almost a bit fishy and I found myself scraping crab off the pieces of pasta to maintain the integrity of the fresh pasta and mushrooms. Once I seperated the crab and ate it as a seperate side dish things were cool.  Dessert - none of it appealed to me so I skipped it. Thats huge because I never want to skip dessert. I think people who like European style sweets will be pleased with the selection though.  Im not sure if Ill be back because this place is so random but they certainly earned a return visit. I actually feel guilty withholding the 5th star because everyone there tried so hard.   Uggg - the trials and tribulations of Yelping...  Fine. Ill go back to Taggia. Sometime.',4
'Love it. Beautiful atmosphere great customer service and fresh food. A little pricey but worth it for a fun evening out. My only complaint is that they are closed both Sundays and Mondays--seems a little excessive but thats just me. I highly recommend the cheese enchiladas with green sauce. To all my veggies out there never fear! Their beans are safe for us :) For many years we have been and will continue to be frequent customers.',4
'have been frequenting TT as long as theyve been in the valley was always happy with service and food. but now I see service going down the tube had to wait 20 min for drinks order. looks like they prejudice their own bring out water with no ice without asking :P - some of us drink with ice :)   Our server just wanted to rush through very bad - I do know they have good servers but inconsistency doesnt help. one bad experience is all it takes for not coming back. If kids have to eat - whatever is on the menu is not good enough in my book.',2
'First let me say that I love to write restaurant and hotel reviews and I rarely give an establishment one star.  I actually feel a bit sorry to give this restaurant only one star but thats what it deserves right now.  The short version of why the one star? Painfully slow service high prices ($37 for 3 dishes for lunch??) and a few DISGUSTING sanitary issues.  I had lunch here not long ago with 3 other girlfriends.  We walked in were greeted pleasantly and shown to a table - which was dirty; plates glasses cloth napkins and lots of crumbs from previous guests.  The LINEN tablecloth covering the table was dirty too.  The greeter (owner maybe?) said he would clean it off for us; he removed the plates and glasses and napkins.  I stood there waiting for him to bring a fresh tablecloth - as you should! - but he never returned.  That is DISGUSTING!!  I would have left but my friends really wanted to try the place so we brushed off the crumbs and sat down.    Service from then on was ridiculously painfully slow. The family seems nice enough but they desperately need to hire some other servers/cooks.  Lunch took 1 hour and 45 minutes and we only ordered three items to be shared family style.  However they brought out each dish one at a time.  Whats the point of family style if you cant eat everything together?  (They also gave us tiny bread plates to use because we were sharing instead of normal sized lunch plates.  Very awkward.)  The owner joked when we ordered Do you want to eat this today?  I thought he was kidding; apparently not.  They were also quite slow to refill waters and my iced tea.  Now the food: It was just ok. Im not huge on vegetarian food (tofu etc.) but I love vegetables and trying new things.  I was impressed by the texture of the fake meat and chicken but at the same time all of us wondered what you have to do to the protein in order to get it to look like something its not.  One of the things we ordered was the Kung Pao Soy Chicken.  It was pretty good except that it didnt taste a bit like Kung Pao - almost no spice taste and the sauce was a bit gooey and odd.  The sauce on our Lemongrass Eggplant had an odd texture too although the eggplant was cooked just fine.  The rice that came with each dish wasnt very tasty - a bit too dry.  Two dishes also came with steamed vegetables but they were tasteless.  I LOVE steamed veggies and I hate butter sauces and cheese sauces and the like so normally Im ok if theyre somewhat plain but these veggies were undercooked and actually dry.  How do you even MAKE a vegetable taste dry?  There wasnt even salt or pepper on the table. Odd.  No knives either so cutting said veggies was again awkward.  Now for the other health issues.  The man who sat us and took our order seemed to be mainly in charge of the tables.  There was one other girl who was in the back cooking but she also did some of the serving of food in addition to clearing tables taking checks etc.   I worked for 15 years in the restaurant industry and I know about food handling safety.  Whats wrong with the above scenario is that I didnt see this girl wash her hands very often - and I had a pretty clear view of the kitchen.  It is of course possible that she went in the back every time she had handled a dirty dish and washed her hands before preparing the next dish.  But when I returned home I went onto the Maricopa Environmental Health website and found quite a few violations for hand washing and major food safety (such as not keeping foods at the proper temperature not cooling/storing food properly etc.)  Put together all of that makes me NOT want to return ever.  They need to hire more help revamp some dishes and be MUCH more concerned about sanitary issues.',1
'Having lived in Louisiana for two years overall I wasnt impressed with the food atmosphere etc. overall.  Maybe its in a good location but it wasnt visible from the road (or not as far as I could see).  The restaurant was randomly decorated with cajun propaganda posters and articles.  One article on the wall was about New York City and didnt fit in at all.    My friend and I ordered the house wine and it was decent but I guess you get what you pay for.  Also we ordered the spinach-artichoke dip for an appetizer with garlic bread; I cant complain about that dish.  For dinner I got the Baby Kays special with red beans and rice and seafood gumbo.  I enjoyed the gumbo because it had crawfish in it and the red beans and rice was okay too.  I was going to order the crawfish etoufee but it was $18.25 when the other entree was $11.25 and I had spent a lot on my vacation.  A green olive coleslaw was included with the entree but it contained a lot of mayo and I didnt eat any more than one bite.  That was kind of my fault though for ordering coleslaw.   i thought the decor was really dated and the waitress/bussers asked me like five times if I was done with my gumbo which I was not.    Good cajun food is hard to find beyond the bayou.',3
'New location ~ havent been able to get in yet ~too long of a wait ~ must mean its good.  Its great to see so much prosperity.  Blessings : ) KC',4
'Its an ok breakfast place.  The place is overhyped.  This is no different than what I can make myself.  The coffee is ok.  I was disappointed they did not offer real cream with it.  Instead its organic milk only.  The hash brown were mushy on the inside.  The waffle is nothing special.  If you want some quality breakfast go to Butterfields.',2
'I have been coming here for 6 years or so. The main reason I keep coming back is the cleanliness. I have gotten pedicures manicures and brow waxing done here and I have never been disappointed. The friendly staff are always smiling and professional. If youre looking for an affordable clean place to get pampered then this is the place.',5
'This place is great.  If youre starving and in the mood for quick food...its not your place; but otherwise a great idea...especially for a date night or celebration.  We got the yin-yang pot (the spicy side is VERY spicy) beef shrimp several vegetables and clear noodles.  Played it safe this time but will be more adventurous next time.  The waitstaff is really invested in making sure you have a good time and assuring you that there is no right way to do it.    The produce is incredibly fresh.   LOTS of food for about $40.',4
'Holy jesus this place is expensive!   2 burgers fries and drinks for like $25 bucks?! Id love to go more often but not for these prices. Literally one of the most expensive burgers Ive ever bought.',4
'I came for the Thai Issan food which is heavily influenced by Issan culture and not as much by the Siamese which is the typical style of ubiqitous Thai restaurants . The history is a different story. Its about the Issan food; generally not supposed to be spicy oily or colored but looked homemade can eat with your hand without feeling primitive and satisfying.  My party ordered 5 plates to share. They arrived in about 15 minutes. The Pad Thai was right on in terms of flavor soft texture and not colored. One saucy dish had some flavoring issue which could be fix by the cook tasting it before it leaves the kitchen. The other dishes were fine. The portions were right on and ingredients looked and taste natural. This is not processed fast food but 1 to 2.0 step above it as it takes a skilled and versatile cook to prepare and make. The dish prices are a few bucks more than typical Thai food but the taste here is commensurate with the price.   When we arrive we saw 2 women waitering there. I didnt experience the 7 minute followup rule and we had to call to get refills. The service could use some improving but I think it will take some time and effort from the Asian staff to get up to speed in American style of service. I thought it was noteworthy that they ask how I wanted to vary the spicyness of my particular dish.   The store is smartly located near downtown and easy to access. The bland outside of the store does not match the inside. You will find granite table and a nice interior decor that is not too touristy. The inside decor raises the expectation that the food would be good and this place succeeds in that aspect.  I would recommend this as a place to bring others with me for Isan food. The place just need to institute more American style customer service efficiency and attentiveness then it matches the quality of the food and make this place a great place to stop by when youre in Phoenix.',4
'Very tasty! Flavorful and lots of food for your $$! Delicious cashew chicken and crab puffs! Right around the corner from my work I will be going here again!  Also it looks dirty from the outside but surprisingly remodeled on the inside!   Just try it!',4
'Chocolate chip cookies are delicious. White chocolates and milk chocolates!! Yumm Yumm. Get the little ones served in the brown bag...theyre much softer than the big ones.  Adorable little fast casual stop to get a quick salad or sandwich before heading on your way wherever that could be within terminal 4. Probably one of the healthier choices in the area.  Pricey $$$ but youre in an airport...what can you expect.   At least the food is good and wont make you sick because nothing is worse than sitting on a flight with stomach problems.',3
'So good! Perfect for comfort food! Just amazing food!',5
'Really nice quality sushi and fried. Very excellent service. Unknown Japanese beer terrific. A value for quality and service. Five stars except for reception busy training new staff.',4
'BEST. PHO. IN. THE. VALLEY.  HIGH QUALITY PHO. HUGE PORTIONS. ACTUAL VIETNAMESE FAMILY MAKING THE FOOD.  The aforementioned points are very important for me. As someone who ranks pho as probably one of my most favorite foods in the world I take pho restaurant critiquing very seriously.  Broth: 5 Stars - How do you tell if a pho restaurant is good from the get go? You order it. They bring it to your table. Get your spoon... and taste the broth. This is where the love and care shows people! This place has some legit broth and it shows that they actually care for the food they are making.  Vegetables: 5 Stars  - Some places have nasty wilted bean sprouts... but at this place the veggies are always fresh. Good assortment of whats available: basil bean sprouts lime jalapenos and some sort of cabbage-like leaf that has a great peppery taste.  Spring Rolls: 5 Stars - A lot of places has this pre-made but this place makes it to order. You can tell because when you bite into it you can tell the pork was just recently grilled.  The only tough this is they may forget to fill up your water cup just because its so busy.  As a Seattle native whos in the area for school I had gone to many other places only to be incredibly disappointed. Back in my hood pho places are just as numerous as Starbucks and a good place is hard to find. Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home... Ill always be a Khai Hoan-er for Life!',5
'LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I love this W. Especially during spring training time. It was the best time of the year! This is definitely my kind of place. The pool rooms bars. It was a great experience here. Nice mini bar when in need but its only about a shot! Haha',5
'OMG! Are they putting crack in these donuts or what? They are addictve. Cannot wait to go back.',5
'3 stars mainly for the entrees.   The bar service was lacking and the wrong vintage of wine was served to us that was far less in substance but not in price than what was on the wine list.  The manager seemed apologetic but offered no discount. We left 1/2 the bottle sitting on the table. :(  The entire meal was saved by the entrees. The root beer braised beef short ribs were superb in taste and tenderness. The ancho rubbed beef fillet was quite enjoyable.',3
'Not a coffee drinker but I am a computer geek in need of wifi.  This place is open late (10pm) and has a soda fountain (score).  Fresh cookies and pleasant owners make it above average!',4
'Good deals! No long lines staff was helpful! Got to use my kohl bucks and spent almost next to nothing on pjs for Christmas! Happy we stopped by here! Wasnt all crazy everyone was cordial and was in and out in 20 mins with everything we needed! Store was clean and you could still find where everything was at happy with this visit! :)',5
'I came here with a big group and was excited to have a good dinner however that did not happen.   First half of our party was going to be late so we decided to put in an order of appetizers and order two bottles of wine for the table. Ten minutes later the rest of our party showed up.. Another five minutes our caprese appetizer came then the wine a couple minutes after that. Finally after 10 more minutes we reminded our waitress about the garlic bread we ordered and only then did it come to the table.   Then as the rest of the party was getting their drinks the waitress spilled a tray of three ice teas all over one of the women in my group and her purse. Since we were a big party and the waitress obviously messed up I thought it would be appropriate for her to offer to comp some of our drinks this did not happen.   Later we were ordering all of our food and we decided to just split all of the entrees. Since Im a vegetarian I decided I was going to order the gnocchi to be sure there was a dish I could eat however our waitress informed me they were all out of the gnocchi that night. So not wanting to make a big deal about it I informed her I was vegetarian and since one of the dishes my party had already ordered was the Quattro al Forno (which included the Cheese Manicotti Chicken Cannelloni Baked Ravioli and Stuffed Shells) she explained that all were vegetarian except the chicken cannelloni. I hadnt really studied the menu so I trusted what she said and told her that i could get by on eating off of those plates. Fast forward to when we finally get our dinner someone in my party advocated for me to get first pick at the plates without meat so I got a stuffed shell and some of the baked ravioli. After eating the baked ravioli i started chewing some of the stuffed shell and realized there was indeed meat in it. I quickly spit it out but couldnt believe there would be meat in the dish. When the waitress came back a member of my party asked the waitress again if there was meat in the stuffed shells and she said no. Then I spoke up and said there was and that I had tasted it. She responded that she would go check on that. She came back a few minutes later and told me what I already knew that there was meat in the shells. She offered no real apology to me did not offer to bring me out another dish or comp anything.   I was so upset and felt so sick after that it really ruined the rest of my dinner and night not to mention I have been vegetarian for six years and this waitress couldnt even offer me an apology for something that was clearly her mess up.',1
'The food and service were excellent. I would recommend a reservation on the weekends as the place had a 2 hour wait when I was there on a Saturday night. Our waiter was knowledgeable and enthusiastic.    The swordfish mac & cheese wine list were all top notch. I was not too crazy about the green beans though.',4
'Every year we are in Arizona my husband and I have to stop here for dinner.  He absolutely loves the fried alligator.  I love the fresh fish dishes.  The prices are a little bit high but well worth it for the quality of food you receive.    On this past visit we had a great waiter.  He was very helpful and friendly.  He did the right amount of check ins on us without being overbearing.',4
'Consistently very very good.   A bit spendy but you get what you pay for in this world.  Ive never had a bad experience - ever! Great steaks nice mixed grill choices great shoestring fries great drinks and wine selection.  When its time for serious steak - I head to Flemings.  Even dinner in the bar is a great experience.  The bar can get crowded but isnt that the idea?  My wife and I will go grab dinner in the bar have a great meal catch the game on the 2 TVs they have do some people-watching and have a nice time.  Ive been to Flemings in San Diego as well and had the same results.  They get it!  Try it youll spend some money but youll really like it.  Beats Maestros anyday better than Durants (in most cases) and better than Drinkwaters.  Right up there with Mortons and Ruths Chris but a bit more affordable.....but it will never be Erie Cafe!',5
'We went on a Thursday date night.  used a restaurant.com gift certificate prepared to spend plenty of cash money on drinks and fun food.  The service was horrible and food was okay. we seated ourselves and the bartender finally had to come and bring us menus because the two servers on the floor were busy chatting and facebooking.  We ordered drinks off the menu these were horrible.  We ordered a second round to see if we could switch things up and they too were awful.  We ordered the $2 tacos and they were tasty.  Wings were not great dry and leathery and we left half the plate untouched.  I had to walk up to serving station to ask for dressing drinks and finally our check. We were almost the ONLY people in the whole place and still got the worst service.  Never going back.',1
'Custard filling is bland.  Also lately their donuts have been making my tummy sick.  First time I thought it was me then bought more later in the week and sure enough my tummy was very upset again. I ended up throwing nearly a dozen donuts away. :(',2
'This place had a great vibe. The restaurant appears very modern and styled well. The service was excellent. Everyone enjoyed watching football from the variety of tv screens. The food was also good. I ordered a rainbow roll which was ok. We also got a chicken curry squid salad and chow mein. The portions are very generous. You will go home stuffed and with left overs.',3
'Cute place not fancy but comfortable.  Huge beer selection and knowledgeable bartender.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp and penne pasta.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor.  My boyfriend had the bacon cheese burger cooked to medium which is to done for me but I had a bite and it was still juicy and delicious.  My lunch also came with choice of soup or salad and I chose the Caesar.  Fresh parmesan plus they added sun dried tomatoes best Caesar Ive ever had. This is a great place to chill after a hike or bike ride.',5
'The Marquee is probably the best venue in town in terms of shows. They get some solid acts and you will not find a more intimate venue outside of a bar. I have attended 3 times to see Badly Drawn Boy/Ray LaMontage and Social D. I always had fun.  Worth noting: THERE ARE NO SEATS. Concerts take place in a giant room with a concrete floor (slight grade probably for drainage ha ha)with a giant stage in front and numerous speakers.   There is a bar out front with beer/liquor which gets busy but always appears to be well-staffed. There is also a small concession stand/store which sells the performing bands merchandise and CDs. The walls are decorated with very cool old poster from previous events.   As the first reviewer noted parking is VERY sparse. I show up very early or take a cab. It is a cheap fare from ASU/Mill Ave.',4
'The staff is really nice and makes a genuine effort to have an engaging conversation with you it takes a little while to get your drink and a lot of them are overly sweet but t has a very open feel and great atmosphere and live music sometimes. Great place!',4
'I dont quite understand the negative reviews either- Ive been here multiple times and the only miss I have ever had were the crab cakes.  Every other sandwich burger salad breakfast skillet french toast that I have ordered has been fabulous.  Coming here for the last two years this location has been a model of consistency in food and good service.',4
'eba is good .   old location was much better .  nice staff . nice place.   check it out if you have not.',4
'I cant believe we get to review a free publication.  Nonetheless its important to know (especially for Dave B. who obviously didnt do his research) that this magazine is published by a gentleman who grew up here in the valley and wanted a way to promote all of the great creative people and activities they are doing by making a free magazine.  He decided this 17 years ago and despite pretty much breaking even (it costs money to print and distribute thousands of magazines and no the ads do not cover the full cost) continues doing so in the name of cultural awareness.  Notice that the photoshoots use local designers local models local photographers and local locations.  The articles are about artwork currently displayed in local galleries businesses (like restaurants) and bands that local folks have started on their own from meager means and about up-and-coming events like the taco festival (started by a local) fashion shows (again utilizing local designers and run by locals - no Dillards show coverage here) and about people in the valley who are trying to make a difference in our community.  If the magazine doesnt seem critical enough its because the people who are the magazine decide what to write about and therefore dont have to waste pages with hateful criticism when Java can be promoting a local chef or a cool new local jewelry designer.  When its run by a local written by locals and put together in the publishers dining room I cant think of any magazine with MORE credibiilty and freedom.  The publisher and writers are meticulous in choosing to write about what moves them rather than what the latest hype is.  Thats why you read a story about the man who purchased a building and was designing it into a venue before it was the Crescent Ballroom.  Thats also why youll read the backstory on five locally owned little-known coffee houses at far ends of the valley.  The candid shots in the back are a tribute to local events the publisher attended but maybe an article hasnt been written about or to local artists designers or patrons of the arts.  While its always interesting to hear what people think of Java knowing what really goes on behind the scenes gives me nothing but respect for the handful of folks to who put their blood sweat and tears into creating this free publication each month.',5
'This place has amazing burgers and fries. You can tell its better quality ingredients but is a little over priced.',4
'most authentic italian i have ever had! service is great very warm and inviting. everything tastes fresh and homemade just like a visit to italy. its family owned and ran. the pescatore (for the seafood lovers) its excellent! portions are very large. whether you eat in or dine out you will be addicted at first bite! lol',5
'My birthday was this past Saturday. I wanted a place thats low key and has a good mellow vibe.   Ive been to the Lost Leaf a few times and I love the homey feel it has.   We scored the front room that had a table and a tiny bar pushed against the wall it was cozy for the 10 or so of us that were there.   They have a great beer and wine selection. They had a live band playing but not sure who it was all I know is they murdered one of my favorite cure songs. Also there was no cover to get in even though they had live music so thats cool.   The place was hopping but never felt like it was to busy we got our drinks nice and quick and never had to wait. The Lost Leaf is one of those nice hidden gems in the valley.',5
'I was last year about 2 years ago with a friend who treated me and its probably one of the better treats Ive ever received (tangible treats anyway. Being Awesome is a great intangible treat I happen to be very blessed with. Har har.).   The restaurant was a ghost town when we were there and it sounds like a recurring issue. No clue how they stay open but the food is out of this world. I remember going out on a limb and trying a bunch of things I wouldnt typically and making exciting new culinary discoveries. That said Medizona does the exotic VERY well and remains the only place I will touch lamb and veal.  Im treating the friend that took me the first time next week - I expect it will be as amazing as we remember.  Dont worry youll hear about it if it isnt.',5
'The food is seriously amazing. Healthy good fast food is such a rarity. One can eat Subway a few times before you never want to go back. MFF has a nice variety to choose from for any meal. The meal plans are helpful but if you already cook a lot prolly dont need to do it. I grab a few lunch meals and keep them in my work fridge for the week.',5
'I brought my mini schnauzer here  for grooming and I was not at all impressed. I had been here once before and everything turned out really well but something clearly has changed. My appt was for 8am and I was there right on time only to find the doors still locked and no employee in sight. When the person finally arrived he asked how I wanted her cut to look and I specifically explained that they can trim her beard but should for the most part leave it long...shes a schnauzer he confirmed and told me she would be ready in 2-3 hours. Not too bad I thought although last time it literally only took an hour but I decided I would go across the street to sbux and relax while I waited. Fast forward 4 hours and I still had not received a call to let me know my dog was done. I decided at that point to go back and check to see what her status was. Upon arriving the lady grooming her told me she would need an additional 20-25 min so again I waited and we left about 30 min later. I noticed at that point Gigis beard was a little too short for my liking but figured it would grow. It wasnt until I got home and really looked at her that I noticed her beard was completely crooked...wth?! and they left two huge knots of matted fur on the underneath part of her tail. Granted the rest of her cut looked great but what the heck were you doing for an additional 2 hours with my dog....with that amt of time she shouldve looked perfect. I will not be back to Poochies ever again.',1
'I was fortunate enough to be treated to an amazing meal at Maestros City Hall this week.  It is certainly a classy place (still trendy and cool inside) and while the restaurant can be a bit stuffy eating in the bar area (full service and tables) is much more lively and has a better ambiance.  The entire experience was fantastic from the pours on the drinks the service to the amazing food.    I ordered the 18oz. Bone In Filet and it was amazing.  It cut like butter off the knife and the sides were awesome as well.  We had creamed spinach lobster mashed potatoes and an spectacular mac and cheese with a cheese I cant remember.  YUM!    Traditionally saving the best for last we one of the best desserts I have ever had.  It was a butter cake that I could have licked the plate on if it would have been appropriate.    Great for a romantic special dinner or an upscale business dinner.  Very cool and hip!',4
'Always quality +Great food',4
'For those of the shoe-addicted variety DSW is your heaven.  Almost any type of shoe you want can be found.  Black patent leather flats?  No problem.  Formal strappy wedding shoes?  Also no problem since I got mine from a DSW!  I love their clearance section.  You can pick up some really good deals for shoes that are still very fashionable.  I got 40% off of some black leather riding boots today in the clearance section even though they were selling the exact same model and color for their regular price in the boots area of the store.  Service is exceptional at this store from the cashier at the counter to the manager on duty.  All in all a good place to feed your shoe addiction.',5
'This is probably my favorite spring training stadium besides Ho Ho Kam. I like the design the atmosphere and everything else about it. Free parking!! except we parked seriosly about 1/2 mile away. That was crazy.',5

'I have two rescue dogs that had never been to a Boarding Kennel or groomer.  I left them there for a weekend because I had to travel out of town.  Tyren is the best groomer!  She is so sweet.  I will definitely be taking my babies back to Tyren at the Foothills Pet Resort.',5
'Im pretty much a fan of any Pita Jungle.. but especially this newer Desert Ridge location for two reasons. First it is only about a 10 or so minute drive up the 51 to this Pita Jungle from CenPho with little traffic during non-rush hours. Secondly the tables are HUGE which is a big plus for me considering that the tables at other PJs are cramped and pushed together. They seem to be ironing out the flaws in the food and the space is really beautiful. Pita Jungle is perfect as always for a fast quick and healthy meal.',4
'My 76 year old mother went in to buy replacement pads for her pool vacuum and was treated extremely rudely by Bob. He was the only person there busy and spoke in an ornery tone. I was on the phone listening to him yell and just talk like a jerk to my mom and other customers. Bob needs some anger management classes. And this store needs to ditch Bob in place of someone who can be polite and knows a thing or two about customer service. NEVER patronizing this store again.',1
'The situation... Daughters prom dress zipper rips 2 days before prom and still needs to be taken in and hemmed. Since the next day is my day off wife gives me the task of getting this all fixed. I tried calling a number of places that would not commit to this until it dawned on me that my dry cleaner Catalina Cleaners in Chandler had a seamstress on site. I decide to stop in and the woman gladly accepted the task which was done in about 2 hours. I am now a hero to my wife and daughter(s). This place rocks customer service that is above and beyond.',5
'Okay so I am not really sure if this is the same Salsitas I am accustomed to But it is in Mesa so that is close enough.  Salsitas is unassuming enough if you were to pass it going along your way minding your own buisness you might not even realize what a gem this tasty little place is. I sure didnt. One day at lunch break my buddy Jose and I are out on the search for a good burrito wed been burned previously by a competing little Taquería Senor Taco- now La Palapa but i digress. So wondering where to go for our measly 30 minute break and running short on time I was getting desperate. Then Jose opines oh man they have a salsitas here! So I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot. We climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint. Straight up authentico feel to the place not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer from Carnitas to Pastor I was in hog heaven.  We order two burritos de pastor I get mine w/ guac pico and refriend pintos free of charge.  As we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish pickled carrot shredded cabbage lime salsa verde and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro. By the time were done w/ the salsa bar our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work.  As Im typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat my stomach is full and my eyelids heavy.  Although the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied. For under $5 you can grab a monster of a meal that frankly isnt nearly as greasy or fatty as say Filly Bs or that shit hole taco bell. I love salsitas and will continue to make my weekly pilgrimage.',4
'Go for happy hour great prices! Thursday date night all-day happy hour Sunday and pretty much all of their specials really are a GREAT value. Some of the best sush Ive had around here and its close to home. I highly recommend!',4
'The most relaxing bed and breakfast in Southern Arizona.  Linda the owner is wonderful.  She really goes out of her way to make sure you have a comfortable stay.  And her dogs are charming too.  You get so much more than what you pay for.  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt toast fruit juice coffee cereal oatmeal all kinds of good stuff.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless.  My favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock spa with a little waterfall and a grill that guests can use for BBQs.  Lovely place to get away for a night or two...and really feel like you took a vacation.',5
'I am going to keep this short.   For those of you who have been to Teharu you want to know how it compares:  Quality - Draw Variety: Sushi Station Wait time/Service: Sushi Station Price: Teharu  So if I am willing to make the drive and I have a little extra cash on hand I will pop into Sushi Station. Otherwise Ill be waiting to find a seat at Teharu.  If you live near this fun little place give them a go.',4
'I love these stores.  I have been to many.  GREAT options for pizza.  Take it home bake it yourself.  Hot and fresh out of the oven.   This was a newer location.  Much easier than my other location in Apache Junction.   And they have some new menu options.   Try it.  You wont order delivery again.',5

'The Monday Night Pork Chop Special (MNPCS) was really good as were the mashed potatoes! My mates tried the Turkey Ruben and the Club Sandwich - both were said to be quite edible...  This is a very affordable dinner for the old town area.   I saw what looked to be several regulars hanging at the bar.  Karsens will also deliver to several local bars that dont serve food! (J Chew Rusty Spur Patties...) Also note that this place is TINY.  http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_035ff3',4
'How does one measure a little donut shop? As far as Im concerned one measures it by the friendliness of the staff and the availability of fresh delicious donuts.  The family that opened this donut shop is amazingly friendly. Ive been in there at traditional times (Saturday or Sunday morning) but also odd times like Friday night. They always have an incredible array of fresh donuts that are way better than the competition in my view. Krispy Kreme can go home.',5
'The best Chicken Salad ever! I have had many in my time but this one was over the top! Their little tiny dessert samplers are divine. Service was excellent! We had the lamb flat bread it was good but not the best Ive ever had Overall all it was a very nice experience and I cant wait to go back and try other items on their menu.',4
'I got a combo plate and I thought the food was fresh flavorful and fulfilling. :)  I mean I definitely thought some meats were better than others but its a personal preference.  The chicken was juicy and well-cooked.  I dont think this place deserves those bad reviews but check it out for yourself!',4
'Best. Karaoke. Ever.  For my boyfriends birthday I went balls to the wall with their uber-fancy 20+ person private karaoke room with its own patio. At $150 an hour I was cringing a little at the outset. However after a number of surprisingly inexpensive vodka cranberries ($5 each.... and this is Scottsdale!) I found myself fondling my boyfriends boss as he sat on my lap while watching my normally prim liquored-up friends work the conveniently provided stripper pole like pros. Plenty of Journey AC/DC and Black Sabbath provided the perfect backdrop for the shenangians. We made sure to keep the door open even though the staff kept trying to tell us to close it and even those too-cool-for-you Scottsdale fuckers walking by the bar were stopping and checking out the mayhem. Fabulous. Its almost a week later and people are still talking about it. This will be an annual birthday tradition -- mark my words. Worth every last penny.',5
'Ive only eaten in the restaurant part of this place once several years ago but was looking to buy black Cardammon to use in making this home-made hard liquor based hot sauce that I read about in the Jan/Feb 2011 edition of Saveur magazine (number 25 of the 100 items identified as chefs favorites) referred to as boozy hot sauce (I had something like it in Okinawa in November which the locals make to put on their noodles it was amazing). The prices on the spices were amazingly cheap and I bought several other spice items for when I do Indian based cooking (lentils are good for you but man they need some spices to taste interesting).  I had the good fortune to talk with the owner of the establishment. He told me the prices are so affordable because he deals with ethnic clientele  who use lots of spices and simply will not pay the sort of prices one sees in most stores. However he assured me that he buys his spices in small batches (like 5 pounds) and then breaks them up himself and he checks everything when it comes in if it doesnt smell fresh he sends it back and noted that he has a large base of customers that just buy from him for the spices.   My challenge of course is I dont know much at all about Middle Eastern cooking but if you are going to do it this seems the place to buy the ingredients.',4
'Love the diff flavors of froyo. They change most of them daily or weekly? Toppings are fresh and delish! Must try if you are in the Tempe Marketplace area!! Always clean & friendly!',5
'I have been to this location multiple times before with okay results. However lately my visits to this store have been a huge joke. There is never anyone on the sales floor and I have to go hunt someone down if I want to check out. Additionally they used to have so much more of a selection. Dont waste time or money here go to a different store.',1
'Licking ones plate is frowned upon in First World countries; not so much in the Third World. In Haiti its a compliment to the chef. So beware before you use a seemingly clean plate you should ask a few questions like (a) what the last meal served was and (b) how long ago. If the answers are chicken-in-sauce and less than 30 minutes you can be sure that the plate had been licked clean not washed. You should then also ask if there are any leftovers.  Euro Pizza Cafés chef deserves this unique compliment. The cheese ravioli in cream sauce with bacon was perfect. The pasta had been cooked to perfection a few seconds past al dente. The cream sauce was really flavorful--not just salty in the manner that underachieving pasta chefs like to mask bland sauces. The bacon bits had been sprinkled with care ensuring that each ravioli had a crown of at least three.  The cream of mushroom soup was also very good; not too heavy not too thin. You could taste that the base broth itself had been delicious before the cream and big chunks of mushroom had been mixed in.  With a name like Euro Pizza Cafe Id imagined a simple pizza parlor staffed with French women in berets and short scarves. Not so. The restaurant is spacious with prime outdoor seating overlooking the second-tallest fountain in the world. Additionally the wait staff though not French was very pleasant and easy on the eyes.',5
'Huge portions very cheap prices delicious biscuits and friendly staff!',5
'You would think that the idea of fast food sushi would send you running for the hills but that is certainly not the case with this concept. It is clean simple and the quality is consistent. The only reason for four stars is that a very large portion of going out for sushi is the experience and trying new things. How do you roll is just for getting your fix without all the fluff and stuff. If you want to try something different for lunch and you are in a hurry you can be in and out of here in 15 minutes (that is including time to nosh). Definitely out of the ordinary and definitely worth a try.',4
'Stopped by this market was actually looking for the u pick peaches place.  Went into the store some of the veggies looked old.  Found 2 strawberries & a couple tomatoes went to the counter checked out and she said $3.01 but the store charges $.50 to use a debit or credit card so it was $3.51 I said oh I did not see that I have cash in my purse and the lady said it already went through.  I explained I did not know they charged a fee and she spouted off it cost me $.90 and very unprofessional said do you want your $.50 back. I understand business & costs and this is one I will now AVOID.',1
'The best spot Ive found for eye brow threading. Its no thrills but gets the job done without the irritation of waxing. If only it didnt cost over $10 for a service that takes about 5 minutes.',4
'Good food reasonably priced and friendly service.  Nothing mind blowing but solid and Ill definitely be back.  Had the crabby benedict side of bacon and a $3  bloody.  I want to come back and try the Kahlua french toast.  Parking is easy with a good size lot and room enough inside for small group brunch.',4

'Finally a good sushi place downtown!  Yesterday I emailed a friend who works a block from my office inquiring about meeting after work sometime the sample Squid Inks happy hour menu. He promptly responded Lets do this tonight! because its been months since weve eaten sushi. So we did. Aside from being open in a construction zone (apartments are being constructed on top of the hotel thats above this location) this is a gorgeous restaurant. The staff are friendly and attentive but dont hover [thankfully]. During happy hour select sushi rolls and signature cocktails are half priced; there are other specials but thats really what we were going for. These select items are limited but enough to feed our sushi fixes. We had an order of shrimp tempura spicy salmon and spicy yellowtail (half priced HH specials) an order of salmon nigiri and octopus sashimi. Each was terrific the octopus especially. We also order saki bombers. Sated and slightly buzzed we paid our bill (nearly $50 not too bad considering the amount of food) and rode the light rail home happy.   On a side note the restrooms are tucked behind the main dining room. They were pretty.  We both decided we will be back soon.',4
'When making road trips from Las Vegas to Phoenix or Tucson I almost always stop in Wickenburg to stretch my legs gas up my car and grab a bite to eat. If I am not in a hurry to get where I am going (which I admit is rare) Ill stop into this Dennys for a sit-down meal.  Since I head back to Arizona for the holidays often I appreciate knowing that even on Christmas Eve at 11 pm Dennys will be open since they are open 24/7 every day of the year.   There is a large selection of food to choose from with breakfast being served all day. I have been pleasantly surprised to find somewhat healthy options on the menu.  Service has always been friendly and efficient. Food never takes very long. The bathrooms are clean. And there is a gas station directly across the street I can stop at before heading on my way.  This is an A-OK place to stop for a meal when in Wickenburg.',3
'My family lives in Chandler so we get to this area frequently. We had a gift card to offset the purchase so it made this location ideal and we are seafood lovers.  The decor and inside of the restaurant was lovely and clean and we were seated immediately (a Sunday around 4:30pm)  It was my wife and I and our 2 boys 7yrs and 20mos. We were greeted by a seafood specialist  Whenever I go to Red Lobster I always order the Ultimate Feast (lobster tail bredded shrimp shrimp scampi crab legs). The meal is so tasty I am beside myself and this time was no exception. I am not crazy about scampi for some reason Im sure it is considered good. I would have rather had a few extra breaded butterly shrimp.  I didnt want the eating to stop the crab legs were succulent and the lobster melted in my mouth. The melted butter didnt hurt either  The wife shared this dish with me and we added another order of crab legs and a bowl of soup.  The soup was lobster bisque which is probably my favorite *type* of soup. This souphowver was slightly disappointing. It was tomato-based not cream-based and Ive had better. The bowl was $6.50 which I consider well above average but the waitress gave us the $5 price because she misquoted.  Terrific cheesy biscuits and average sald consumed as well.  I order the Sunset Passion Colada worth every penny of the $6.75.  Overall the experience was exceptional but I have to temper it with the fact that I believe the restaurant is overpriced even for seafood. Our tab without tip came to $56 for 2 adults and 1 child and my wife and I even split an entree.  I believe this true for all Darden restaurants as well. I wonder how much longer Red Lobster and Olive Garden will get away with this. Bahama Breeze went out of business in Phoenix because of pricing.  I recently reviewed Olive Garden and gave it 3 stars.',4
'Oh Pho-get about it!  However please remember to arm yourselves when attending Pho House. This place is in a very sketchy area but if I can risk my life for a burrito I can risk my life for some Pho.  My partner and I both ordered a bowl of Pho.  I like my Pho basic and so far so good no shots fired.  I thought the Pho was pretty good here since my expectations were pretty low with just looks alone.  The broth was nice and hot and their vegetables were fresh and full of scent!    If youre afraid of these places I recommend you stay away.  The place is pretty plain but they do have a LCD screen to maybe catch a game or two.  Service needs more umph but I gather its more of a language barrier than anything. - Enjoy!',3
'Great family venue. Fun and helpful staff.  For the past two years my daughter has wanted to celebrate her birthday with a movie and Johnny Rockets.  The staff is fun and friendly and they were very good with the kids getting them to dance and enjoy the bday celebration. They also took into consideration our crunch for time and served us swiftly and efficiently. Thanks for being so helpful.',4
'Okay so Ill make this short and to-the-point. Its like any other Five Guys in that the burgers (in my opinion) are good but DEFINITELY overpriced. I mean you can get a burger at In-n-Out (tastes just as good) for half the price. The Coke Freestyle machine is bomb though gotta have my Coca-Cola Orange and Peach Fanta (not mixed haha). I would give the place a 4-star rating except for one thing--WHERE ARE THE PEANUTS?! Definitely not the same vibe as the one on Mill Ave. Disappointed but will probably eat there again in the future.',3
'My favorite here is the chicken pho - the flavors are so clean and vibrant I find myself just craving it some days.  Friendly atmosphere quick service and just near enough to my work to make it a reasonable stop for my lunch break.  :0)  Perfect!',5
'This is a hard place for me to review.  Usually when I order from them I enjoy their pizza (its definitely a step up from the big national chains like Papa Johns or Dominos) and this is why I call them back but unfortunately they seem to be fairly inconstant at this location (which is the only one I have tried). There are times (maybe 15-20% of the time) when I order that I find myself fairly disappointed with their pizza. On those occasions the pizza just seems to be more bland and not quite on point. I am not sure what happens those times but it happens enough that I am mentioning it on here.  Overall I would probably rate them with four stars if it wasnt for the inconsistency.   Despite the inconsistency I still put them clearly ahead of the big national chains and order from them when we are in the mood for pizza.',3
'Im a beer nut. I love Rogue Stone and any other west coast craft brews. When saw a picture in new times with a half dozen Rogue taps I knew I had to go. We decided to wait until they had been open a few days and could get the hang of things.  So Sunday night we drove all the way up to the north suburbs into some sterile power center with all the usual suburban crap. I was overly delighted to see pictures of downtown Phoenix all over the place. There are probably a couple dozen photoshopped shots around the restaurant. It definitely made me feel like it was at least not 100% a carbon copy chain restaurant even though it is a chain but its probably franchised.   The wings I would not order again. The quality of them seemed to be fine and they were baked rather than deep fried but they were so small that it made me feel a little ripped off. They were about 1/2 the size of the wings from NYPD and about 1/3 the size of Streets of New Yorks. I then ordered the Rogue Chocolate Stout and the girlfriend ordered a Rogue Juniper Ale both on draft along with just about everything else including Chimay tripple... nice! Pizza was a Kosmik Karma which was a vegetarian pizza and was tasty enough but was a completely average pizza. Nothing was crispy nothing was jumping out at me but it was edible. Id had much worse.   The place is VERY chaotic. Its loud busy and has people running around everywhere. And as youd imagine on the northside there are plenty of white trash families running around lots of 15 year old girls in skate shoes and famous stars and stripes hoodies and lots of lifted trucks. Be prepared to eat with a lot of douches. Service was excellent though. Id return if I were in the area and while its nice to have something to fall back on in that situation I wouldnt go out of my way to go back since really the only draw for me are the beers.',3
'I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and even though its not the closest I thought I would give it a try. Its probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses Ive been in. And for the first several visits I didnt have too much of a bad experience. In fact the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently Ive heard that happens a lot if theyve ever worked.  This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit but then that might be this old persons eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.  I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showings credits ran until about 6:10 and then they as always took their time to clean out the theater. Once in finally the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown which I normally despise wouldve been welcome if just for some light. Well thats why God made cell phones.  Upon finally sitting there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up shouldve been quick so you can continue your discussion about whos ID youd use to go out that night.  But I digress the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the worlds slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But in this case its understandable as no one could see anything.  Question and Ive always wanted to ask this are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine I know theyre not - Im a former AMC employee and I wasnt. Although the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously its already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda but they add the salt on the wound that is by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.  By God I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah I know thats how they get their money blah blah and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. Two Items or Less Lane! No Children! Heaven.  Really movies are still relevant even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. Im sure the one guy at the box office wouldve appreciated that.',2
'As a vegetarian and sporadic health nut I just love TJs. They have a nice array of inexpensive fresh produce including my beloved broccolini for 40% of what Safeway charges. Huge selection of frozen veggie-friendly dinners good for my on-the-go household. Greek yogurt cheap. Nice beer selection with lots of cheapo wine. I try to buy all my supplements here too as they seem to be a lot less expensive. Yes Im all about saving cash on groceries and whatnot.  The downside? Its not one-stop-shopping; a trip always requires supplementation with another trip to a regular grocery store. This particular TJs is teeny-tiny-small and always chock-full of obnoxious and/or oblivious people who wield carts like weapons. My favorite is the woman who thinks its an awesome time to teach little Jimmy how to push his own wee cart and comparison shop and lets the little bastard cruise all over the store willy-nilly. Im all for giving your kid responsibility but a) you still have to you know keep an eye on the kid and b) a super-crowded claustrophobic nightmare like this place after work is not repeat NOT the time to do so.',4
'This is our usual tb so I gotta represent.  Good: Chicken quesadilla  Bad: Sometimes a long line  One time they forgot to give us the sauce... So not as good!  This last time the guy must have sensed it because he have us like 20 so he made it up to is:)  The order has never been wrong that I can recall.',4
'This place is fantastic they have the best burger anywhere!!  Ive never been unhappy with a dish that Ive eaten and the service is outstanding. You have to try this place....its a definite must!!',5
'This place always seems to be busy so that is a good sign as far as Im concerned. Its a sports bar... = greasy snacks and beer + lots of tvs to watch games. A good casual place to hang with some friends and gain a couple of pounds LOL. Appreciate this place for what it is.',3
'Love love love!!!  Great service great food great drinks great wine.  We sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night listened to live music and shared some wine and food.  Very romantic setting and peaceful.  The appetizers are not truly appetizers...they are MEALS!!  Had the ahi tuna tostadas...couldnt eat anything after that.  The portions are large so split if you can.  The food is very very very very good.  We ended up taking some friends there a few days later.  They loved it too.  Love the atmosphere.  This is a perfect place for a nice romantic dinner on the patio.  Absolutely make reservations first.',5
'My first time at this East Valley institution...had the lamb tongue sandwich...tasty!',4
'classic Italian food and a great service!',3
'Hands down......  the best pizza. Rustica = best combination of flavors.',5
'Admittedly I dont buy much when I visit Bunky because I am a cheap bastard but I do drool quite a bit.   Cute cute clothes from independent and local designers. If you dont mind spending some hefty bucks on your wardrobe Bunky can help and youll look fantastic.   Bunky makes me wish I werent such a tightwad.',4
'Ill start by saying I love this place and it has a solid spot on my lunch rotation.  The parking can be an issue at times because of the tiny lot but the valet is quick and I dont mind throwing a kid a few bucks to park my hoopty.    The service is usually friendly and reliable but what keeps me coming back is the food.  I was always really surprised with their American bar fare because it just tasted so damn good.  That was until I found out why.  I met the Chef one day and came to find out that he is a product of Houstons.  Im sure most people dont know this but everything is made in house from scratch (and I mean everything).  Even the dressing are home made.  That turkey club you just ate came from a turkey breast that they roasted in back and portioned on the meat slicer - same with the roast beef.    Im a foodie and I love to cook so I really appreciate a place that does it right.   The prices are reasonable for a neighborhood joint and the quality is outstanding.  The half-roasted chicken is a must have and the ribs are a no-brainer (Houstons anyone?).  Just about everything on the menu is worth a try.  Give it a go you wont be disappointed.',5
'My wife and I decided on this little hole in the wall based on yelp reviews and we were not dissapointed. The food was great and the prices were very reasonable. The only downside was that it felt short staffed so service was a bit slow but we will definately return.',4
'Absolutely the best dining experience Ive had.  From the amazing staff and service to the delicious and beautiful food I can see why its the only 5-diamond rated restaurant in Arizona.  Dont get me wrong you pay for the experience but I believe its worth the price (this coming from a very frugal person who tries to find discounts wherever she can).    My husband brought me here for my birthday and from the moment we sat down we were treated wonderfully.  We ordered the suckling pig torta as an appetizer (portions arent huge but extremely flavorful and definitely enough to satisfy).  The appetizer was great as a matter of fact...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  As entrees we ordered the lobster scallop and shrimp over squid ink pasta with gruyere cheese on top and the buffalo tenderloin with mushrooms.  Both were amazing.  The lobster was no doubt the best dish Ive ever had.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and deliciously rich but not heavy.  The buffalo was surprisingly not gamey and had a great fresh taste without being dry for such a lean cut of meat.    We want to go back and try one of the tastings but for 200 per person we may need to wait for a bigger celebration to go.  But Im already plotting the next time Ill be back for another mind blowing experience.',5
'This should be your only stop when in downtown phoenix for drinks and food. Before or after a D-Backs or Suns game or any other event. Great drinks live DJ playing music in the background all around fun place from the elevator shaft to the restrooms. I recommend any pizza.',5
'First off decent service if you need to grab something quick to catch a flight.  It took 9 minutes from ordering to getting your food.    The burger was good a gourmet burger delivered quickly into your hands. Definitely cooked after you order.  Nothing great but solid for grabbing something at an airport.  Didnt care for the fries but the shake was pretty good.',3
'Rude staff!  I rented two patio umbrella propane heaters for an event.  They were late on delivery the day of the event.  Then on the scheduled pick-up time post event they were also late.  I waited at home for 3 hours for the scheduled pick-up.  30 minutes post time block I called and asked their status or to reschedule.  The gentleman on the other end told me that now they needed to charge me extra money for a specific time pick-up.  I replied I dont need a specific time I just was hoping that you would meet the schedule you had asked for on the equipment pick-up.  I advised that the heaters were on the patio where the delivery technician had placed them the day prior.   The gentleman at A to Z said that again they needed to charge me more money as a set-up charge to get them off my patio where they had placed them originally.  He told me that they needed to be curb side.  So I alone had to carry them up a steep driveway and they were quite heavy.  It was a struggle and massive to handle.  The customer service individuals at A to Z were rude to me and non-helpful.  All they wanted to do is stick me with charges above and beyond already set contract.  I will never use them again!',1
'Fillys Roadhouse has a singing Idol contest going on Sundays 5-6 pm... It is the best entertainment in town.. with a jam session to follow. I love going there 7 nights a week because there is always Great Food Good Music and Friendly People to talk to and Dance with... Come out and kick up you heals!  You will see what I mean.',5
'Great pizza and great wings. Very cheap and the taste is awesome.',4
'I was actually against going to this place but my boyfriend insisted and was drawn in to these hand-pulled noodles. So off we went...  Plenty of parking in front of this corner resto in the plaza. Open til 10pm I believe on Saturday. Typical Asian joint. We got the assorted marinated meat combo appetizer (which tasted awesome IN my soup). I went for the oxtail soup while the boyfriend had beef noodles in oyster sauce. Both of course with the hand pulled noodles.  We both slurped up all of our noodles. Happy tummies! And very friendly on the wallet. Great find on our short visit to Arizona.',4
'There are many Med options out there and like one person has noted there are a handful on Mill that cater this type of food. Unfortunately for the others this one is the best. Aligning the walls of this establishment are awards for their outstanding service and food. The owner is Turkish and has developed an amazing array of handmade dishes he undoubtedly learned to love in his native country.  I appreciate so many different things about this place. The gyros are great and the food feels fresh not processed or stale. The salads are good as is the humus. Being a smaller business they make their dishes in house and the processed foods are swept away making this a quality and enjoyable meal. It might taste different to you and thats because it is.   There are many fine Greek restaurants out in the valley that push out amazing dishes this is not a fine dining establishment like others filled with waiters and high priced side dishes. What Med-Fresh does is  push out amazing food at a good price and the locals have steadily fell in love with it. I was worried with the economic downturn that this start up might not last but ASU students and locals have embraced it.. Also notice all the ethnic and minority groups that frequent this place. Its a very good sign of whether or not its a true-blue restaurant or non-traditional. I always notice many foreign students sitting and enjoying the food which assures me that considering where they are at for the time being this is their best and favorite spot.  Try their Gyros first unless you are a big Med food geek which in that case you can expand further of course. Start small then go from there. Enjoy!!!',4
'My partner and I had heard about FEZ from all our queer friends in Phoenix and so we jumped at the chance to check it out when our friends wanted to go there.  Despite getting there around 7pm on a Saturday evening they were able to put us on the heated patio with only a short wait.  It was fine with a coat but I wouldnt suggest it otherwise. Im guessing in the summer they have misters.  It started off well.  Most of us got iced teas and some of us ordered starters.  My partner and I got a half/half basket of sweet potato fries/garlic rosemary fries.  The garlic ones were good as were the sweet potatoes ones but they were a bit too sugary to start the meal out with.  From there the food stayed tasty but the service went down hill.  It took a while for the extra ketchup to come out and when it finally did 3 main courses were brought out (for a table of 7).  Another seven minute later 3 more courses came out.  People were polite but after another five minutes I told everyone to dig in. I desperately tried to find out server but to no avail.  When I finally did (when the rest of the table was half way done -- she never even came back for a how is everything check to note that my veggie burger hadnt come out). When I finally caught her she told me it was right there on the counter and she just needed to grab it.  However it took another 5-7 minutes for it to come out.  Then she never did a taste check.  She filled someones water glass with iced tea took it and the tea pitcher away to fix it and left 3 of us with empty iced tea glasses till the end of the meal.  She brought one less box then asked for and it took another 10 minutes to get the extra box.  Of course since we were a group the 20% gratuity was included. I dont know if she was new or just knew she didnt have to worry about the tip but I was far under impressed.  However the excellent food rocking tunes and cool decor will be enough to get me back in the door again to give it a second chance.',3
'This is a good breakfast restaurant. Im a fan of their very large menu. Everything is just standard except that they serve cheese grits (Im a big fan). I do enjoy the updated decor. The previous establishment was decorated with country farm wallpaper and roosters. The service was good. Nothing to complain about... just not that extraordinary in my book.',3
'This restaurant came highly recommended but there was nothing remarkable out it. The interior is the now overdone industrial design with exposed air ducts and lots of sheet metal.  The food was very basic and the prices not all that attractive to make me want to return. The chips were unsalted and stale. The salsa was hot and spicy but with not alternative offered went untouched by most in our party.  Hours after eating 3 of the 4 of us complained of stomach pains and other intestinal distress. Maybe just a coincidence.  Theres much better Mexican out there. Dont waste your money.',2
'the food was not what i expected.  to start with i ordered the veggie shish-kabob.  the  lemon potatoes where mushy and did not taste fresh.  my husbands gyro meat was extremely dry and had a weird after taste.  i wanted to like this place but wont be back after this experience.',2
'I have to say I was very disappointed with this place considering the level of reviews its received the location nearby lots of other great spots and just the look feel and menu.  The first problem was before we even went.  I had tried to call and make a reservation but I couldnt hear the person who answered the phone at all - it was super crackly and cutting out with only tiny bits and pieces coming through.  I tried calling a few times with the same result.  So I had to just give up and go when we were ready to eat and hope we could get a seat in a decent amount of time.  When we got there though they said they could seat us but wed have to leave in one hour for another reservation (wonder how they got theirs!).  We thought an hour should be plenty so went ahead.  But then we proceeded to sit there for about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at all - so there went almost half our time despite 4 servers just kind of slowly wandering around and standing around.  I tried hard to get their attention to no avail until I finally got up and asked.  Our server just made a lame excuse.  The problems just continued from there taking forever to get our appetizer a bad drink for my wife more crappy inattentive service and finally to top it off - bad food too!!  I was pretty shocked actually.  But both of our dishes were bad.  My wife got a fish special that was super bland and I got a steak that was sitting on top of a soggy piece of bread swimming in a pool of watery sauce that was spilling off the plate as the server so carefully tried to set it down in front of me.  It kind of seemed to us that maybe this place used to be good or is maybe good on other nights or something but this was a Friday night and for everything to be bad from start to finish like that just seems pretty suspect.  As if the whole regular staff including the chefs were out on vacation or something.  I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and not rating it more harshly because there was really good atmosphere and decor the server was friendly when she was there and at least parts of the food were good - enough to think maybe it really was just a horribly off night.  Im not sure if wed go back though considering the price - huge waste of $$ and way overrated if this is the norm!',3
'Cute busy place in Central Phoenix. Not hiding behind gimmicks to make themselves authentic. Simple and sweet. Staff is well versed in Japanese food if you havent had it in years ask. Great staff great food great times.',5
'I love Songbird. I work close by and its so nice to have a great coffee house so close. The pastries which the buy fresh from local makers are divine. Go for the brioche cinnamon roll and thank me later. The coffee is stellar. I cant even put a finger on whats different but Im guessing its the utmost attention to quality and detail of their product.   Seating is a little sparse and prices are a little high but the goods received are worth it.',4
'Great food great people great atmosphere.... i could go on! My daughter loves boba snow and Tony makes it the best. They have tons of teas too! The RAMEN IS VERY YUMMY! Plenty to share with someone!',5
'My wife and I had been looking forward to a meal at Distrito for some time. When we arrived at 8pm on a Thursday night we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. That should have been a telling sign that possibly it was time to look elsewhere for dinner.  Before our appetizers arrived we enjoyed the cornbread with chipotle honey and citrus butter. This was tremendous and we had hoped a prelude of the meal to come.  We started with the fish tacos and octopus appetizers. Were fairly educated foodies from NYC with a great appreciation for an amazing Phoenix food culture after living here for nearly three years and have eaten in some of the nicest restaurants in the world. We both agreed the Rubios fish taco is better than that served at Distrito. The fish was alright but the tortilla was stale and overall it was dry at best. The octopus was fine nothing to write home about.  We shared the Skuna Bay Salmon and the Garlic Prawn entrees. I kid you not that we couldnt finish our salmon entree because it was so sweet. In a pasilla pepper broth I would have expected some heat... not a piece of candied salmon with raisins. This was very disappointing. The shrimp entree wasnt bad but we both agreed it tasted no different from the tequila citrus shrimp that we not formally trained chefs make at home.  The entire meal lasted less than an hour. The service reminded me of what you might receive at an Applebees. We never had even five minutes to enjoy alone before we either brought our next course or approached. I stood up to use the restroom in the middle of the meal and noticed that much of the staff was sitting at the restaurants bar. Regardless of how empty a restaurant is and this one was completely empty I would never allow my staff to sit at the bar. It just looks bad.  Average food at best + poor service + high prices = most likely not going to return.  What a disappointing experience for a meal we were quite looking forward to.',2
'Freaking awesome breakfast rock solid service and an amazing building design. This is a winner that is here to stay! I liked everything about this place from the moment I stepped through the door. Worth a trip!',5
'I actually love this place very good food and excellent salsa.  Its a little seedy around the gills but has the biggest selection of tequila in the world.  99c margaritas are good but small salsas are very tasty with the gratis chips.  Im not a vegetarian by any means but DO get the repollo and corn enchilada....its a fantastic mix of grilled cabbage and corn on a tasty tortilla.   mmmm fabulous!',4
'Ive been hearing about Tee Pee for years; its considered a Phoenix landmark I think!  George W Bush has been there afterall!  But it wasnt until my husband purchased a groupon for this place that I was forced to go check it out.    My quick summary: *chips and salsa - meh nothing special kind of stale tasting to be honest *guacamole - nasty *Bud Light - A-OK *Chicken Tostada - decent *House Salad - decent but simple (its just lettuce and tomato) *Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water and when we finally did we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!  Bottom line: I dont eat Mexican very often but when I do Ill likely go elsewhere.',2
'I love this place!  I like their coffee a lot like that they roast it locally and the customer service is awesome.  The employees generally seem really happy to work there and like getting to know their customers.  I like the little things they do as well like having a punch card and not making you use it only for the cheapest drink.  Keep in mind that this is a local coffee joint not Starbucks.  Each barista adds his or her own touch to the drinks and the ambiance and lines dont move quite as quickly as a big rig coffee place.  Plan for that and you wont regret it.  Matador does everything to show how much they appreciate their customers and makes every effort to keep them happy and it shows.  Every time Ive been in there Ive seen other regulars.  Ive taken drinks to coworkers and friends and its always been a step up from whatever their regular drink source is.',5
'I was very impressed with the service and food. St Francis provided a delicious meal and beautiful ambiance that was just right for a group of clients after work.',5
'So we visited this place against my husbands wishes since I had heard pretty good things about it. To sum it up it seems a little over priced for what you get and even though it is healthy and organic we were left hungry and unimpressed. I would say the food is average and $16 for a bison burger is a bit ridiculous unless it tastes amazing.  Drinks were fresh but also expensive and I just feel like there are much better restaurants out there in that price range.',3
'Rocking wings!!  Went there after work was craving wings on a Friday evening.  I know it is a chain and wings have a lot of cholesterol.  But for one thing it is the good cholesterol right?  And for another thing the wings were perfect here.  Exactly how I like them crisp and drenched in sauce.  Not chewy and frozen tasting like some other disappointing wing experiences.  I had the honey hot wings.  Man Im still licking my fingers!  Tasty Antipasto salad too!!  Very crisp and delicious.  It has a sport bar feel to it and being by Metro center I am always a bit leery of the gangster types over there.  But it was quite good.  I will be back for sure.  Good brisk and attentive service.  Oh and great selection of wing sauces. This is wing heaven!  One order of boneless buffalo wings 15 honey hot wings Large antipasto salad Order of fries One margarita (very average at best) One beer (they have Guiness on tap)  All under $50 including tip.',4
'At long last Americas Taco Shop is finally open. Unfortunately theyre not open very late just yet--they close at 8pm on the weekends. And theyre still working on the liquor license thing. And a couple of other just-open restaurant quirks. Luckily they are extremely excited and eager to please.   Their Mexican waters were unbelievable (go with the Tamarindo) and big gulp sized. The corn was awesome as well. All grilled up and slathered with mayo cotija cheese and hot sauce. I also ordered a quesadilla vegetariana which could have stood a bit of flavor (the owner went to get salsa but never came back...seriously) but was not at all bad. Next time Ill try their bean burrito which is made without any lard in the mix.  The price is right and theyre right around the corner so Ill definitely be back.',4
'so awesome great salmon/bagel breakfast dark coffee! and the chicken cashew salad is rockin!',5
'I saw the mention in that book-- was it The Best Pizza in America or somesuch?-- and since I was living pretty nearby at the time I dragged my sister out to get in line at 4pm or so.  The pizza was most definitely not amazing stupendous or even particularly impressive.  It wasnt horrible it wasnt inedible but it wasnt worth the hype and it was not worth the wait.  I would give it 3 or maybe 3 1/2 stars but it gets worse thanks to the atmosphere.  My sister and I chose what we were going to order and she excused herself for the restroom and the waiter came over while she was away.  He made it quite clear that I had one chance to order and I would not be able to make any changes or additions once he put the order in.  Between that and the hectic din and the general sense that this place was all that and a slice of pizza I was sort of let down.  As someone else here pointed out though the bar next door was actually quite nice.  Pleasant atmosphere and definitely more relaxed.  We chatted with the bartender for a time before we realized that we needed to get in line to get our name on The List so we could come back to the bar.  Hmmm.  I say take the time you would spend waiting on line for Bianco and spend it with friends and family at your favorite local pizza joint.',2
'For 3 years I was a subscriber to chronic cardio as my form of exercise.  I signed up for race after race to stay motivated and completed my first full marathon a year ago.  During that period I dodged knee problems here and there and after the marathon the injuries seemed to stick around longer than ever.  Thats when I knew I had to change things up and a friend recommended Crossfit West Valley.  The workouts are always challenging but are scaled to accommodate varying skill levels.  The staff is very helpful and thorough with instruction and advice when it comes to diet and other recommendations when it comes to getting the best results.  Within the first month I was in better shape than when I was at the height of my distance running and 6 months later I am still improving.  Id recommend this gym to anyone looking for a unique and challenging way to get in shape.',5
'Stopped in yesterday for a first visit to this library branch as they had the book I wanted & it was on the way to other errands for me.  For a branch library this modern two-story place is particularly nice inside.  The staff was friendly checkout was almost instant at the do-it-yourself station and parking was right outside the front door.  No shortcomings!     :-))',5
'We ate inside as it was too hot to be outdoors.  The outdoor dining area is probably the most beautiful in the area but needless to say you cannot be out there at this time of year.   Inside is pretty ordinary but I understand this as they do a big lunch crowd when the weather gets better.  The place was only about a quarter full which is very sad as Ill bet the boring chain restaurants were busy.  I dont get the values here people would rather go to the Cheesecake Factory and eat the same manufacured crap they can get in Des Moines or Cleveland rather than go to an independent place with genuine local food.    The food here really is really very very good.  Some dishes need a tad bit of work but this is probably the closest to farm to table the area has.  The waiter was much better than the last visit as well.  My only complaint is the menu is hard to read.  The font is small and the print is so light you need a searchlight to read it if you are over 40.  Luckily the waiter gave me a small flashlight  I sure hope this place picks up customers as the weather gets better.  It would be a crime to lose it.',4
'Stayed here for a business training.  Its a Hilton so the rooms were nice.  The pool area and bar were awesome and the cleaning staff were nice.  The only issue I had was with the front desk.  There was a mix-up with my reservation (their fault) they charged my company Am Ex twice and I had to go through Am Ex to get the situation remedied.  They could have made a better attempt to satisfy a customer!!!',3
'Neither my hubby or I liked this place. Our food was not tasty- we were thinking jeez-Im paying someone to cook this?? And although my hub liked his beer I didntike mine. Well go elsewhere.',1
'Visited again and just want to reiterate that the food and service were fantastic!  Bar none the best Falafel platter I have had.  A really enjoyable restaurant!',4
'If only I where rating this place based on their sushi I would give it 5 stars.  But Im not  rating it based on the food.  It is purely based on the customer service in this establishment.  Be warned; if you have a large party this is NOT the place to go.  Ive been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and I have NEVER heard of a restaurant not splitting checks for large parties.  So for an over 500.00 bill they will take 15+ different forms of payment but wont split up the check by individuals or couples.  How does this make any sense.  To make matters worse; they bring out the sushi and I quote family style.  Since when did sushi get served family style?  Here is the problem.  Sushi is expensive not everyone at the table ate it and when served family style someone else may get what you ordered and you wont have a clue it even made it to the table.  We spent over 40 minutes trying to figure out this bill SERIOUSLY!  When I asked the manager her generic and obviously well rehearsed response was this is our company policy we do not split checks for large parties.  This is absurd.  So not only did we have a heck of a time figuring out the bill Im pretty sure no one really knew who had what and if they had added random things to the bill.  How could you know with that many people ordering????  I never received part of what I ordered yet it made it on that bill.  So here we have to pay it regardless of what we may or may not have received?  I understand that adding gratuity to a party this size is also common practice which I dont normally have a problem with but how about some EXCELLENT customer service in return.  If policy is no separate checks at least tell everyone as they order or as a group that this will occur.  They said someone was told when the reservation was made.  The reservation was made for 25 people!  It wouldve taken 2 seconds to again relay this important piece of information.  Worst experience ever!',1
'I just had my second Spa appointment and I must say it gets better and better each time! The staff is so friendly the waiting room always so clean and the service is extraordinary! Everyone should partake in what the Spa has to offer!',5
'My friend who is a native Texan invited me to try Rudys BBQ.  He told me it was the closest thing to real Texan BBQ.  As I started walking into the restaurant I heard some country music.  I knew that at least the ambiance going in would be authentic.  You start off your journey by picking up a beer.  I recommend the Shiner Bock IPA or original Shiner Bock.  You can choose assortment of meats and sides.  If it is your first time or if you want to sample something they will give plenty to try out.  I highly recommend their jalapeno sausage and pork loins.  When you are done you can ask for bread and make a little sandwich with whatever items you picked out.  Lastly you have an area where you can pick up your condiments and sauces.  The BBQ sauce here is awesome!',5
'Happy hour until 8pm and huge selection of wine and craft beers.  Limited seating so get here early!',5
'This hotel was a great venue to hold a wedding reception. There was plenty of parking service appeared to have run smoothly and the setting is beautiful. It was also convenient that we chose to take up the couples wedding block deal and just stayed here for the weekend too.  Service from the hotel overall was meh. Most times when I was carrying luggage in and out no one opened the front door other guests we knew had to contend with broken toilets malfunctioning sinks and room changes. Maybe these mechanical issues will be resolved once theyre done painting (and renovating?) part of the second floor Im not sure. The pool was nice though and its a pretty good location within reasonable driving of some good source of food and shopping.',2
'This place is ok not great and missed the wow-factor for me.  Im a native born and raised on carne asada Ill probably die with a burrito in hand.   As you will see there are a lot of gringos in this place at lunch time.  Heres a clue for the white folks good Mexican foods can be found where the Mexicans eat.    Again dont get me wrong this place is ok... just didnt deserve all the hype.',3
'Ive been to the Desert Botanical Garden many times and each time it gets more enjoyable.  When I first moved to the Phoenix -- I was totally ignorant to all the beauty of desert life.  This garden has helped me to see the errors of my ways.  There is so much variety to be found between cacti and succulents.  As well as a multitude of desert critters :)  There are several events hosted throughout the year to make DBG worth revisits -- Flashlight Tours Jazz in the Garden Butterfly Exhibits etc.  The staff is knowledgeable and enthusiastic. The grounds are well manicured and well planned out (wide meandering trails specialized gardens nice garden shop and folk art displays).  Its great for both family and singles alike.  Lately there has been a bit of construction as they have been improving their garden... but I dont mind cause its all in an effort to make the place more enjoyable.',5
'Everyone is very nice in Raising Canes. Taste is really average nothing even close to famous chicken finger.',2
'I was lucky enough to stop in here for a quick dinner over the weekend. Can a dinner be quick and romantic? Yes it can.  We were early so the place was pretty empty. Having the room to yourself? Romantic +1   The Coronado is in a great old Craftsman style building with separate rooms full of beautiful wooden fixtures and great old built-ins. Even the bright pedestrian art contributed to the cozy yet polished vibe.  We started off with drinks from the cocktail menu. My date had some sort of gin and lemonade that was delicious. My Enter the Dragon? A bit too cough syrupy but that was completely my fault for ordering something with raspberry vodka and expecting any different. Both were strong.  The crusty chewy bread came with a quality olive oil and fruity balsamic for dipping. We inhaled the first plate and got seconds when dinner arrived.  I ordered the Filipino-style beef salad which was FULL of melt-in-your-mouth thinly sliced ribeye and my date got the goat cheese relleno with creamy polenta.  That chef has got it goin on! The grilled veggies in the relleno were not mushy and the polenta wasnt grainy. My ribeye had crispy edges but rare centers and there was a perfect balance of dressing to greens.   Our server was attentive and efficient without being all up in our business and the prices seemed reasonable for the quality.  Thank you Coronado. I will be back.',4
'Carne asada burrito.  Ive been going to Americas for years and dont even know what else is on the menu.  This carne asada will turn vegans into meat-eaters in one single bite. It... is... amazing. (Just thinking about it is literally making my mouth water right now!)',5
'I came here for their friends and family event and while I typically wouldnt write about it since it was virtually gratis and it is their start-up week I didnt even see potential in this place (I went to Bourbon Steakhouse for a similar type of gratis event and it fucking rocked... I refuse to review them yet because I know Ill be back when they will actually be in operation). As a matter of fact the only recurring thought I could muster during the entire meal (which mind you lasted just under 3 hours) was:  What the hell?  First bad experience here: sitting on the toilet as a 59 woman my feet were dangling. Bizarre. And the stalls are very looney-bin-esque... sterling silver from top to bottom with no obvious ventilation or way out if someone locks you in (yes paranoid is the word youre searching for).   Second: The chairs are beyond uncomfortable but wouldnt be so awful if I hadnt had to endure such a long-lasting meal (note to restaurants: this long-lasting concept? Good for relationships and like gum. Not so much for supper).  Third: Ive had better food at pretty much anywhere that charges even a fraction of what this place does. It was kind of outrageous but I didnt begin a violent rampage because as mentioned they were buying.  Four: Our wait time in between dishes averaged at about 15 minutes from picking up the dirty plates to dropping new ones. This isnt accounting for how long it took for them to clear our table despite the 9842759873 servers bussers sommeliers and bartenders milling around (Im not even counting the armada of hostesses).   I can see many a Scottsdale douchebag or Eurotrash enjoying this place but its probably because (pardon me for being caustic) they havent recovered their taste buds from last nights coke binge.  Sidenote: Our server was awesome. That said hell probably find something better very shortly.',2
'Staff was very helpful! They test our water all the time and have been helping us get our pool of the hook for the summer.',3
'My fiance is orignally from New Mexico and ever since weve been together (5years) he always always talks about green chiles and how much he misses new mexico style cooking. Me being from California Ive only had mexican food thats been Cali-forni-a-ized although a year ago my fiance started school in AZ and him and his mom (who also is from new mexico) found this place and fell in love with it.  They told me about it and so on my next trip down to AZ I went and Aye Dios Mio its magnificante! I love! this food and not only that but their margaritas! WHOA! After eatting a meal like they bring you its hard to finish it. They bring you chips and salasa and BEANS with Green Chilies in it omg the beans are soooo good you forget all about the salsa.   The only 1 bad thing was when I went one time and they had $1 margaritas during happy hour they tasted as if they were virgin margaritas I know sometimes I dont look myy age so I asked the waiter if it was a virgin and he said no and I said to just take it back and get me a big one then cause the 2 ppl I was with as well as myself didnt taste a drop of alcohol in that thing   But with that being said I still gave 5 stars cause Ill go back anytime!!!',5
'DISLIKE.  Normally I fly southwest - for some odd reason US airways this past time was the better deal. NEVER AGAIN!  I like to consider myself not much of a complainer (see other reviews) but my flight out of PHX to LAS VEGAS was horrendous.  Allow me to clarify. Not the flight itself but the plane. I might as well have been on a private jet. I think if I stretched my body from fingertips to toes I would make up the width of the plane... Im 51.... Another down side was that they charge for checked baggage - needless to say I was not going to pay the extra fee and thus consolidated all my belongings into a small approved suitcase only to come to find out that it wouldnt fit in the overhead storage. Again - terrible. Again - reference to the size.',1
'I have been going to Yaphas for years now and they never disappoint. Each meal you order youre able to get soup and a salad from the soup and salad bar. It seemed strange at first putting hot peanut dressing on a cold salad but wow that dressing is so good I could drink it. I always dump a little in my soup as well its so good. The service is always a little slow but I would wait any day for such kickass food. I always order the drunken noodles with beef thai hot its so good. A must stop for any one that loves great thai food.',5
'Okay so I am rather new to town and have been to very famous and not so famous soul food restaurants around the world and this one is to me only decent.  I decided to try this restaurant out today after visiting an historical church for Sunday service that is right across the street.    As I walked over to the restaurant I got giddy inside thinking that I would be welcomed by absolutely amazing down home soul food that I have experienced in Harlem Houston St. Louis New Jersey and even Philly but I was not.  I knew that the ambiance was not going to be upscale which is fine with me but the food is not as exciting as the previous reviewers make it seem.  Maybe my taste buds are a little too snobby but like I said I have had amazing soul food in other places not just the South.   Moving on I had the fried chicken mac n cheese black eyed peas cabbage and corn bread.  I must say that the black eyed peas and corn bread were pretty good but the cabbage lacked lots of flavor and so did the fried chicken.  Also the fried chicken was very salty but lacked flavor which to me is a little oxymoronic.   The waitress/waiter were very nice.  I will not go back because I do not feel like the meal was worth the $13.00 plus tax.  I will go over and try Lo-Los Chicken and Waffles soon and hopefully there I will find delicious soul food that I left behind on the East Coast in New Jersey NY and Philly!',3
'Lox Stock & Bagel offers great food in a friendly atmosphere.  From the bagels to the lox to the cream cheese everything is tasty and fresh. For a great meal of bagels dont miss this!!',5
'So we went here for Game Night UYE and I was a little concerned that it was going to be a) too loud or b) too crowded.  We found a giant wooden table/bench thing and set up shop there.  The waiters/waitresses were all cool and very helpful.  Not too pushy and they were always very quick with the beer delivery.  Gotta say they were awesome.  The beer selection is amazing.  Not in love with the mandarin orange thing but they had enough stouts to keep me happy throughout the night.  This place is really cool and reminds me of a lot of the places back in Olympia.  The only knock is the food.  It wasnt great.  It was better than your average bar food but I think in this day and age of gastro-pubs and high end wine bars you have to have quality food.  The Beer Bites were tasty but lacking in seasoning.  The chips and dip were pretty good but the chips were a bit stale.  I will go back without a doubt.  Great place and we had a great time to match.',4
'We live in Troon within a mile of this location so we were very excited to try the food.  Its tucked back in a strip mall off the main road so keep you eyes open or youll miss it for sure.  When we pulled up and got out of the car our mouths started watering from the smell in the air.  We were told the burgers where outstanding and that they had some new items on the menu.  My wife ordered the ribs and I ordered burgers and fish sandwiches for the girls and I.  The rub on the ribs was excellent however the ribs were obviously boiled then kissed on the grill so no smokey goodness but decent flavor thanks to the rub so lets give them a B-.  I should have ordered the regular burgers because the sliders where lame compared to many weve had around the valley and the fish sandwiches were so greasy we took a couple of bites and left both sandwiches on the plate.  All in all we were not impressed however the owner or manager came by our table and was very friendly and the service was good not great. Bottom line we will give it another try and update the review later.  We are going to try them for breakfast.',3
'I am one lucky hummus-sasbi-falafel-lovin chica to be able to be about a 7 minute walk to Sahara. Its worth the venture from far away places to seek out this jewel. It would be worth the gas anyway because its inexpensive and 100% delicious. The menu is standard middle eastern fare with great vegetarian choices but all consistently tasty. Since Im such a carb fiend Ill mention that the pita and rice are perfect.  On top of serving up some super saucy dishes the owner and family are SO incredibly nice and friendly. Your second trip there will feel like some rite of passage because hell recognize you and youll feel like youre sitting at the family table. Id probably feel like a bad person if I said the food didnt taste good because they are so nice. The comfortable setting lovely staff and delicious food make this an altogether wholesome experience. Mmmmm.',4
'Came her today for a late brunch with the boyfriend.  This place is certainly busy and you should just expect to wait; there were only two of us so 20 minutes was what we were told.  I really liked that they provided coffee and water while we waited (although the water tasted terrible).  Once we were sat we were greeted by a really friendly waitress who was very attentive the whole meal kuddos!  The mimosas here are really great you can definitely tell the orange juice is freshly squeezed with just the right amount of pulp.  Food took awhile to get to the table but was worth the wait.  I ordered the chorizo mac n cheese and my boyfriend ordered the hickory ham eggs Benedict; my dish was tasty but I felt they skimped on the chorizo the eggs Benedict was really delicious though!  The side of fruit that came with my meal was enormous and mostly delicious; I could tell that some of the watermelon pieces were beyond freshness.  Overall we had a really pleasant meal but I dont think Id ever go out of my way to return.',3
'2.5 STARS would have been a perfect rating.  FOOD: As far as Im concerned the best thing available at Cafe Roma are the calzones. The cazlones cheese sauce and bread are all pretty good. They are huge and decently priced. One calzone could feed two non-starving people. I usually have to struggle to finish one. Other dishes are decent but nothing to come back for.   PRICE: A calzone and a drink cost about $9-10.   ATMOSPHERE: Its a typical low-cost Italian restaurant. TVs in the corners music playing in the background a couple decorations on the walls. Good place for lunch or modest dinner.   SERVICE: Nice people but they can be almost too helpful at times. Sometimes they come by the table four times during the meal to ask if everything is alright. Sometimes I want to shout Yes! Everything is wonderful now leave us alone! They know I get the calzone every time I go there its a cool feeling to have that regular status.  SKINNY: Try the calzone I think its pretty good. If its not good then Im sorry I wasted all this time writing this review only to lead you astray.',2
'What a disaster today.  I have eaten here occasionally over the years and all is as expected.  However today what a fiasco with one mistake after another.  They first gave my meal tray to another customer and I received theirs.  I attempted to get the hostess attention but she continued on her way.  I walked around trying to find my meal and the other patron had opened my meal before realizing it was wrong.  He accepted his meal from me and I suggested we both have our meals re-cooked to assure piece of mind with no tampering.  He declined but I did bring it to the staffs attention.  They remade my meal but here is problem two I paid for the Six Dollar burger and what I received was a regular size burger with no apologies or willingness to correct my order again.   As said Ive been here over the years and todays service was pretty dismal without satisfaction or apology.  I wont be back simple mistake they failed to correct....very poor customer service!!  You gotta be kidding!!',1
'This is a higher-middle quality end chain food... almost on par with The Keg but not quite - also not as expensive as The Keg. I go here every so often.  One big turn off to me is this place tends to be very loud and it is difficult to have a relaxing dinner unless we get there early. The kitchen is open to the dining area and the dining area is basically one massive high ceiling room. Should have been designed better for a quieter more relaxing experience in the dining area.',4
'Handlebar is awesome. Very laid back. Theres good service whether its 4pm or 12 am. It doesnt matter the time I go there I know Ill get taken care of. The food is delicious too. Pretzels are a must with the beer cheese.',5
'I had high hopes for the Marquee.  I hadnt had the chance to see a band there yet tickets for My Morning Jacket were $30 not worth it for me.  But when a friend wanted to celebrate is birthday there I agreed to go.  First the parking lot has no signs to signal you in it is hard to see because it looks like you are forced to go onto the Mill bridge but then make a right at the last second.  Parking is $5?  What?  I should have parked across the street.  Now the tickets are not just the price you are quoted they are marked up by a $3 service charge at the box office.  At the box office right in the theatre!  No ticketmaster nothing.  Just raise the price of the ticket!  Now  they make you take everything out of your pockets and force you to be patted down.  Errr.  Then if you want to drink they take a photo of your license for their computer.  Errr.  Was there a shooting here or something because this is ridiculous.  The interior looks like it is meant for 4 H Fairs or Amateur Wrestling.  There is a concrete floor poor paint and nowhere to sit.  The drinks are way over priced ($7 a shot for Jager!!!  Robbery!).  Give me $100K and I will turn this place into a venue worthy of its location and name and make it a profitable venue.  Cheap carpet sound baffles/curtains high top tables new paint in the lobby would make this a place worth seeing a show in.   I will try to avoid the Marquee at all costs its too bad there is no where else for midlevel bands to play here.',2
'4 stars for the flavorful Jerked chicken veggies and beans over rice (see photo above taken sometime in May 08).    2-star deduction caused by my witnessing a young adult male dressed in athletic clothes who reeked of body odor enter the front entrance and then proceeded to enter the kitchen area to grab food for him and his companions.  As if it wasnt enough I had to bat flies away from my table.   (But then again for a certain number of weeks out of a year its hard to keep flies away ANYWHERE.  Just visit the EDR where I work!)  I shall NOT return!',2
'Just returned to SD from AZ.  Yelped to find a mexican restaurant in Scottsdale.   This place had a good number of reviews we decided to give it a try.   The food is wonderful!  The service was very slow but once we received our entrees we were more forgiving.   The abodoba burrito had hunks of tender savory beef with cooked for hours flavor and the rolled enchiladas were wonderful too.   They offer green or red sauce and I went with the green a nice change and so much flavor.  Two cheese and one shredded beef enchilada with rice and beans.  Everything was prepared from scratch and full of flavor.    They will charge for drink refills and the margaritas are very pricey.  Chips may cost extra for an additional basket.  Wed go back again the food is really wonderful.',4
'Very good food.  Good service even when busy.  Their own microbrews.  Whats not to like?',4
'Outstanding customer service!!! Great camping firewood bags!!! HUGE bags of high quality long burning wood for $10!! Cannot be beat!!!  Cash check or use the ATM they have in the office ($2 fee).  http://www.bbfw.com/',5
'I went to an early comedy show (7pm) and got there after everyone else was already seated. So there was no long line to wait on.   However I did see the line for the *next* show already snaking down the stairs. At 6:45pm. Ugh. (I would highly recommend confirming the line youre getting on. Or you might risk getting on the wrong line.)  That was the upside to being fashionably late. The bummers (very minor tho) were trying to find parking and then getting seated at a table in the back.   Our server was super duper quick in summing up the special drinks of the night. I tried the Blue-r Version of the Long Island Iced Tea. (Didnt honestly do anything for me. For my second drink I just went with a rum and coke.)  I got reprimanded for grabbing a few pictures of the show. I wasnt filming a video or using flash. Just grabbing a few shots (for Yelp! of course!) I must have missed the sign outside or something advising the NO PHOTOS (but I didnt see it on the way out either). My friend and I didnt hear it the fifteen minutes before the show started. The only useful thing we heard was Turn off your ringers!.   So anyway dont take any photos or the smartphone bouncers will come out!  Have fun kids!',4
'Drove by this place several times and decided to finally stop by to check it out one afternoon.   It was by far the worst pho Ive EVER had!  We couldnt even finish our lunch and went next door and grabbed some burritos.  The soup had no flavor and had about 2 pieces meat in my bowl.  So most likely will not go back unless the owner is changed.',1
'I love wine and trying a bunch of different wines. I have seen Kokopelli wines in Sedona and wanted to try them so I was highly enthused to see they were within a couple miles of my house!  So Im going to be honest... since shaving my head I test peoples ability to not judge a book by its cover especially when Im a customer.  I watch carefully how I am treated to see if there is any change thats different from what I was normally get with my longer hair.  This place was NO ISSUE at all.  I could have walked in with purple skin for all they cared.  That was a plus right up front.  We were seated promptly on a Thursday night to some really nice live music.  He was enjoyable talking with the other patrons and with us.  His music was excellent to listen to while eating also not too loud or anything.  Waitress was fine... she was attentive no issues with her.  We ordered the crab and artichoke appetizer and it clearly wasnt what I expected.  It actually had a texture and taste of an excellent chunky soup that I could have had rather than a dip.  It was slightly bland but good just totally against what I expected that it kinda threw me off.   I was hoping my food wouldnt turn out like that.  I had the pasta Danielle which was very good although again slightly bland.  Had the spice it needed but didnt have taste behind it.  The key here... add salt.  I hate adding salt as typically most dishes have enough to begin with but these clearly didnt.  As soon as I added salt it was great.  The wines are awesome... love the Sweet Lucy which is a sweet red.  I also had the Merlot which is awesome also.  Im not one for Chiantis but my partner had a Chianti and it was better than some german chiantis Ive tried.  The decor of wine barrels on the wall is nice and comfortable a bar in the center of everything with a tv which appeared to have a good selection of alcohol.  There was a good number of people in there for a Thursday night which surprised me.  Most of the patrons were of senior age which may explain the food.  I will go back though to try some more.',4
'As a bar this place actually has the propensity to be something incredible.  As it is its really chill and great and I like to kick it there when I have a chance.  With a few slight modifications I could picture Time Out Lounge being transformed into my permanent hang out.  You ever seen that movie Mean Streets?  I could totally see me being Harvey Keitel and Time Out Lounge being my permanent hangout spot.  I love the amount of pool tables and the dartboard and the internet jukebox.  I like the whole layout of the bar.  Its very cool and most of the bartenders are really nice.  One of my favorite touches is the tables that have endless amounts of various graffiti in the form of fuck yous so-and-so was here and strange political points and counterpoints that it all blends together into a nonsensical collage of intoxication.  Brilliant.  The bathrooms are awesome.  There are murals that have a lot going on.  Its really fantastic after youve had a few pitchers.  If youre ever in this part of Tempe and want to have a couple beers and shoot pool Time Out will do a damn good job.',4
'Beautifully hotel and great lounge.  Nice place to grab a drink',4
'The pizza is ok here - not great but ok.  But their antipasto salad is great!  Lots of olives peppers and fresh greens - not just iceberg!  Their house dressing is a great Italian vinagrette too!',3
'I would like to preface this review with this: I had no desire whatsoever to eat British food when I came here.  I was forced.  I was told it was amazing and Yelp reviews have very rarely steered me wrong.  I walked in and loved the decor and set up!  It was very comfortable and I did feel like I was in a British pub.  Not that I have been to Britain.  But I can imagine.  I really like that they carry Quorn products.  I recently became aware of this meat-alternative and have gone a little nuts over it.  It tastes and has the same texture as real chicken.  Anyway I digest.  I had the Quorn Chicken Pesto Pasty.  Oh my gosh it was so good!  I was not a fan of the sauce it came with and the service was pretty slow which is why it got four instead of five.  The person I went with had....I dont know but it was beefy and came with the best wine sauce ever.',4
'I revoked my wifes dinner picking privledges after she chose this place. This place is clean and means well with the organic and green stuff but that does not make up for the complete lack of quality and flavor in this food. First they use Boylan soda products that are beyond disgusting. There is a reason that most places use Coke and Pepsi products. My diet cola tasted like the smell of bandaids.  Second We got the breadsticks with marinara for an appetizer and they were small hard and flavorless bread brushed slightly with oil.  Thrid They didnt write our order down and the stuff on our pizza was wrong. The pizza was decent size and the pepperoni was thickly sliced which was nice. But the sauce was bland and tasted like the sauce from Spaghetti-os. The crust was burnt so much so that my wife and I were having little sword fights with our crust pieces.  The staff was super nice and everything but they have some serious issues that will keep us from coming back. This place is was overpriced but i guess someone has to pay for the Prius and Smart Car delivery cars.',1
'We were in desperate need for a last minute suit for my husband.  We had a funeral to attend and Mens Warehouse had us in an out of the store in less than an hour and they were able to expedite the alterations and we came back a few hours later and picked up the suit.  The service was great and they really helped us out in a time of need.  I highly recommend Mens Warehouse and we will definitely return.',4
'Its cold stone. Pretty tasty overpriced ice cream served by disinterested teenage girls. Still worth coming for an ice cream for my birthday.',4
'Ive been taking my family to Jimmy and Joes for over 5 years and despite the location the pizza is always consistent and great. Unlike the previous review I dont mind waiting a little bit longer for fresh pizza and salad. However If you like cheap pizza places that offer some of the best slices in town try it out.  If you want 5-star service and overpriced mediocre pizza check out Grimaldis.',5
'Me and the husband usually go for their reverse happy hour. Im pretty happy with the pricing and with the overall quality of the food. Yeah they do make you wear a 21+ wristband but I dont blame them trying to keep their liquor license.   Im definitely a fan of the spicy tuna rolls and the crispy california. Theyre both amazing and decently priced; around $3-4.50 per roll during reverse happy hour. $4 kirins $5 mixed drinks... Their reverse happy hour is 9-close.',4
'Not my most favoritest Sephora ever but its always got the products I need and the handy entrance outside the mall means I dont have to walk inside Fashion Square if this is the only place I need to go.  They have a great range of skin care beauty and fragrance. I feel like the fragrance section is a little lacking compared to other stores but they do carry the scents I wear.   One turn off is that this store always feels like its crawling with sales associates and yet I find that at times they are less than helpful.',4
'I had one of their numerous specials.  Very reasonably priced for the midwest portions that arrive piping hot to my table.  I chose one of the dishesthey are known for biscuits and gravy.  For $3.99 I chowed down on one over easy egg and a single biscuit with scrumptious gravy.  By no means was it visually appealing but was it good!!! The bisciut was buttery and the gravy had just the perfect ratio of pepper to sausage.  The clientele was mostly of the older generation great place to read the paper and shoot the bull with strong coffee in hand.  The waitresses were what I expected like talking to an old friend.  I took a piece of their bread pudding home something else theyre known for.  Great place!! Wish I lived closer to this little gem perfect place for a stop when were out on our motorcycles!',5
'Another great Fuego restaurant!  I was disappointed when Vitamin T closed but so glad to see that a Fuego restaurant took its place.  I enjoyed the cubano sliders and a peach mojito today...yummy!  Great location in Cityscape too!',4
'Ive decided to try this place since Ive been going to Arai Pastry in Tempe for a while and wanted to try something new.  There were many selections but honestly Im gonna stick with Arai Pastry from now on...here is why:  *First of all this is not a Japanese bakery - Im making this clear because even though there are similarities Japanese and Chinese baked goods are most of the time different.    *Less than so so decor - It is understood that the decor of the store has nothing to do with the quality of the baked goods.  However  since I already know a place that is much cleaner cuter and with polite service I cant help but to see it as a negative.  *So so service - There were no labels on each pastry trays so I asked the store lady to tell me what was inside some of them.  All I saw was annoyance from her....maybe she was just in bad mood....I have no idea.  *I tried the following: -French horn - if you want a good one please try the one at Lees Sandwich -Custard cream bread - honestly after a bite we had to through it away...if you like custard cream bread try the one at Arai Pastry',1
'This place offers so much yet I have experienced so little.  Ive lived down the street ever since it was built but have only made the 10 minute (walking) trek twice.  The first time was to see the Chuck Jones exhibit which was very cool and very interesting.  The second time was last night for their open mic night (http://www.tempe.gov/TCA/wiw.htm).  The inside and outside of the TCA is actually pretty cool.  Ive never seen the inside the concert area but inside the surrounding area is pretty neat.  I cant really explain it but it has a good vibe.  My wife and I have been wanting to try their lounge/cafe/bar thing ever since it opened.  We heard that it was a nice place to sit and enjoy the TCA and the surrounding sights.  So when we heard about the live music in the lounge we finally decided to give the place a try.  However upon arriving we found that the open mic thing had grown to popular so it was moved into a much larger and less intimate area of the TCA.  The room was nice but reminded me of a room in a conference center but it did have a very good view of their negative edge pool/fountain thing overlooking the lake.  There was small bar setup where you could purchase wine/beer/cocktails and snacks.  Nothing to elaborate fancy or expensive.  Anyway my wife and I sat for about an hour and listened to some up-and-coming musicians.  I really wasnt a fan of them but I give them mad props for getting up there and doing their thing.  However it was a relatively good time and I could probably sit there all night and listen to random and diverse music.  You can check it out every Wednesday from 6:30 till 11:30 I think.  The bar shuts down at 9ish though.  After we left the the open mic area we visited the main bar/lounge thing.  It had a very nice ambiance and was pretty dead which was nice.  You can sit watch tv or enjoy the view of the lake.  The beer/wine/cocktail selection is pretty standard for a small bar.  Anyway it was a neat experience and nice to have a place like TCA less than a mile from my house.  Im not sure I would rush back to the open mic thing but if Im ever board on a Wednesday night I know where to walk.  However I cant wait to see a concert/show in the main concert hall to see what thats all about.',4
'Sometimes you wish God oh just this once would grant you the power to reach right through your computer screen and smack some doofus on the other side.  Well Ive come to make this request to a higher power.  The negative reviews about The Rusty Spur make my head swim like it would after a pull of Mezcal straight from the bottle.   This place is tip-fucking-top.  You dont want to be pressured to tip the band?  Then pay a cover.  Would that make ya feel all better?  No cover to enjoy a genuine Texas (read: real) country band?  Holy smokes they will even do covers of Robert Earl Keen and Pat Green.  Go to any other shite bar in the city and ask them if they know that.    The place is tiny which lends to its charm.  This place is STRAIGHT out of Luckenbach and these suburbanites dont even know the characteristics of an outlaw country bar.  Waylon and Willie would be proud of this place.  Plus they serve Shiner Bock in a bottle.  Unreal.    The dance floor which is a misnomer more like a shuffle floor is absolutely legit in accordance with the rules of a Texas dance hall except for the fact that you bump into tables instead of only other dancers.  Go watch Urban Cowboy and tell me that you need your dance space.  Get over it.  .... and .... AND! ... Beans in the chili?  WTF?  This aint Canada.  Hell this aint even Ohio!  Beans should NEVER disgrace a proper pot of chili.  Jesus.  What the reviewer who mentioned that has just informed me is that they make their chili proper.  But Id never know because I go in here to hoot n holler n get rowdy with the rest of the crowd ... drink a Shiner and dance a little two-step to Merle ... not stuff my face like a tourist.  Christ.  Im in no way a regular here but this place is one of the very few legitimate country bars not only in Phoenix but worldwide.  Ive been in enough to know.  It should be regarded very highly for its genre.',5
'the name is slightly misleading because they also now serve lunch which is likely a mistake. we called in an order and i had difficulty finding the place because signage is bad and the location is difficult to find. however when i got there the staff was very friendly and promptly handed me my order and i was on my way.   when i got back to the office the food was barely warm (i didnt have to go far but ill take partial blame for ordering take-out to begin with) which told me it was ready waaaay before they told me it would be.   the fries were flavorless and my jalapeno chili veg burger was not the least bit spicy. kinda disappointing. it also was supposed to come with some sort of sunshine sauce but my order had none while a colleagues did. i was overly underwhelmed.',2
'I give this restaurant 5 stars not because its a 5 star restaurant but because their pizza and service are both amazing.  This thin crust Chicago style pizza is almost identical to the Aurelios pizza I grew up on in the south suburbs of Chicago.  Its pizza perfection.  The brownie dessert is to die for.  We didnt try to calzone but saw lots of other customers who ordered them.',5
'I regularly visit Phoenix and stay in a hotel a few blocks away. As soon as I ate at Switch it became my go-to restaurant--as in I have lunch or dinner here every day! Dont miss the lamb lettuce wraps which are usually enough for a full meal. Staff is friendly and attentive and the ambience is cool and mellow at the same time.',5
'If you like Cornish Pasties then youll dig this place. Their traditional flavors are spot on with what youd get across the pond in the UK.  They also have a LOT of non-traditional versions - like a chicken tikka.  And if you have no clue what a pasty is but you like things like pot pies or even hot pockets then give this place a go.  Good selection of beers too.  Only thing to be aware of is that the place sort of looks closed (or even out of business) from the side entrance. Dont let that fool or deter you.',5
'Start your review...Great Golf course dont forget that Collared Shirt even on the Range',4
'Pretty solid Ethiopian food. My only comparisons are Chicago-based but this was a nice find. (This is really late...so I hope theyre around and still serving the same I had - it was awesome!)',4
'Aha! We finally actually got to eat pizza this time! The past few times weve been in the area and have stopped by here its been an hour or more wait and Im just too impatient to do so. Even the place next door for waiting gets too crowded as well!  This time we planned it well... after getting breakfast at Gallo Blanco we figured... hey were in the area why not get some pizzas to go. Yeah I know... I know... they dont do pizzas to go unless you eat there so as gluttinous as it sounds. We ate pizza right after breakfast!  We did it right this time. We arrived around 10am this lovely humid Saturday morning. No one was in their parking lot. Uh-oh our timing was too good. We wandered off to the Arizona Science Center to chill (literally it was freezing in there) and then came back around 10:40am and still no people waiting out front. The first family came around 10:45 and at the same time Biancos brought the valet stand out. A few minutes later more and more people came pulling up. So 10ams too early. Id say about 10:39am would be just right to park sit in the air conditioning for awhile and then stroll up to the door at 10:48 and then even though theres a short line youll still get a table!  We ate the Margherita (tomato sauce and cheese was wholesome and good. Very light on the basil this time) and the Wise Guy (sausage was excellent on this one) pizzas there. Theyre about 12 size pizzas which are good for individual pizzas especially since the crust isnt exactly thick. Everything is really light... the crust the toppings the sauce. No feeling of oiliness at the end because everything is just right.  We ate the Rosa and Sonny Boy at home. The Rosa is very unique and delicious because it has both Rosemary potatoes and pistachios on it. I loved this one and am still crushing on it! The Sonny Boy is definitely for the olive lovers because the olive taste is so strong! All pizzas had the fresh light brick oven taste. Is it the best pizza in the country as legend has it? Although I did love these pizzas I cant reach a verdict because its different. I dont know what to compare it to. La Piazza Al Forno was still this same type of thin gourmet pizza yet the Al Forno cheeses were just so oily and rich and filling. Amaro Pizzeria and Vino Lounge has pizzas that also reminded me of Pizzeria Biancos. All I know is... I loved Pizzeria Bianco and I would wait about 30 mins for it but definitely not over an hour for it. And once I do get in again Im going to take home a bunch of pizzas again!',5
'The overall experience was nice. There could be more privacy. Did not like the waiting area and it being so close to everything. We did a couples massage which was very relaxing; deep tissue and Swedish. Both were great. The place could be bigger. Seems like too much is going on in one building.',3
'PS has been getting a lot of my lunchtime business lately.  Usually go for the sub but on a whim decided to order a Chipotle chicken wrap.  Why do they call it a wrap because essentially its a sandwich in a burrito.  Id much rather be eating a Sanrito which makes me think of Hello Kitty.  Conversely the Burwich makes me think of Burma now called Myanmar which makes me think of self-immolating monks... which brings me right back to the roasted chicken in this here wrap.',4
'Excellent chicken tikka!! We used to drive 20 minutes just to eat here.',5
'Great Food',5
'Great little coffee shop with a very friendly staff.  Glad to see a non-chain coffee shop that knows coffee.  Owner actually roasts his own and you can buy it in bulk if you want.  My wife loves the fact that they have dark chocolate as an option in their mocha blended drinks.  Try the Jalapini BLT.  Yummy!',5
'A surprisingly simple setup that blows air-bending slaps around its world-wide franchise counterparts. The bread is soft and bears no resemblance to any yeasty aromas of its SUB-par rivals while the deli meats are sliced on the spot. You cant really go wrong with that alone.',4
'Divey dive not one but TWO Simpsons pinball games!!',3
'Wow- what a fabulous authentic cuisine we had last night. While visiting the Phoenix and Scottsdale area we happened to get a recommendation for this restaurant. When we pulled up around back (in the parking lot) we were welcomed with a wall of beautiful murals- the colors were so vivid and the art work was so alive. Our group started off with some fresh made guacamole- and I mean fresh. The waiter came out with a cart sliced and diced and prepared it at our table. I ordered the sangria. It came out in a huge glass- didnt have to order a second. Thought it was a little tart but the sugar around the rim was a nice touch to sweeten the pallet. For dinner of course I had to ask our waiter for his opinion between a couple of dishes. He immediately said the: Cochinita Pibil and so thats what I got. Its a 12 hour slow roasted pork served with grilled veggies tortillas and Yucateca. The portion side of pork was amazing. I even surprised myself by finishing it all- but it was that good.  Unfortunately there was no room for desert.  I will make this place my local stop when visiting in the future.',5
'I reviewed this place one time before.  They have replaced the old junk box with an one connected to the Internet.  They also replaced the speakers so they have more control over the noise.  The Trivia Contest did not blow us out of there this time.  Much improved but the beers are expensive.  Have to do there because of pool league but no longer need ear plugs.',2
'This was my 3rd time to Caffe Boa every time I have been happy with the food and service. My husband and I love that they have a lot of Croatian wines and some Slavic inspired food. This time I got the Gnocchi Fricassee and it was DELICIOUS!!!  My husband got the Fuži and he enjoyed it. The table got the Plavac Mali wine and everyone loved it! I will be back again and highly recommend Caffe Boa!',5
'Great authentic Mexican food! Jalisco style. I had the tacos with rice and beans. 2 pastor tacos and 1 carne asada. I liked the carne asada better but both were VERY good. They serve both salsa verde and salas rojo. Very reasonable prices... Wish this place was close to home!!',4
'I love this place!  Teakwoods is your favorite neighborhood bar stocked with peanut buckets on the tables peanut shells on the floor and big flat screen TVs all around.  Tuesdays are my favorite day to go because you can get a dozen wings for only $6.50 ( I think regular price is $8.50 for a dozen).  I always order the same items:  pretzels and cheese soy and garlic edamame a dozen jess jess wings and a prickly pear margarita.    The pretzels are always warm and soft and come with a yummy and creamy cheese sauce.  The soy and garlic edamame are the BOMB!  Completely delish!  The jess jess wings are hands down the best wings Ive had anywhere!  And the prickly pear margaritas are the perfect accent to my meal -- sweet and delish with just a little tartness.    The place is very laid back and they even have karaoke on Friday nights (I think -- Ive only been to karaoke once).  This is a great place to go with a group of friends for a casual and fun evening with good food and drinks.',5
'One of my favorite hangouts in downtown Phoenix! Hannys never disappoints! My friends and I usually visit on Friday or Saturday nights when they have a DJ. I love the music decor ambiance food (my heart belongs to the cheese plate) the young hipster/trendy crowd and drinks. Even when its crowded you never feel ignored by the wait staff which is an extra plus!',5
'Really small place with really good live jazz music food & drinks. The food prices are low but drinks are a little high.  Make sure to check out their facebook page to find out when they have live music:  http://www.facebook.com/AsiaInMesa  Overall this is my favorite place to go when I want a mellow night out with my hubby.  Looks like this restaurant is now just called Asia and has a separate yelp account for reviews:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/asia-mesa#query:asia',5
'This place looks like a typical American franchise and I was not expecting the food and service to be very good.  However what I found was the exact opposite.  I went for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  The place was mostly dead with only 3 or 4 other diners.  We were met at the counter by a very friendly hostess/cashier/server.  She gave us a rundown of the menu and a few specials they were offering.  We ordered the red pepper hummus a Gyro salad a spicy grilled chicken with fire feta salad and a piece of baklava.  The prices were reasonable at everything cost about $20.  You cant beat their $1 specials which cover their soups hummus and baklava selections.  We sat down and our hummus arrived almost immediately.  It was excellent.  Especially the pitas which were fluffy hot and fresh.  Five minutes later our salads arrived and they were equally good.  The spicy chicken salad with fire feta was a bit weird (which is why I ordered it) but in a good way.  It was a very decent size and all the ingredients seemed to be fresh.  The salad had a kick to it so they werent lying about the spicy or fire part.  The gyro salad was excellent.  I wish I had ordered that but wanted to try something different from my dining partner.  Next time I will definitely order it.  Anyway the gyro was very fresh and had been cut just seconds before serving.  The salad was a decent size and very tasty.  For desert we shared a piece of baklava.  It was delicious and just a few bites cured my sweet tooth.',5
'Great beer!  Didnt try the food.  Very friendly folks.',4
'Great happy hour deal on the wine and beer!  But I was a little concerned that the beer selection was somewhat haphazard compared to the care that the restaurant has placed elsewhere in the menu.  At Catherines urging I went for my first bite of Postinos signature bruschetta selection last Saturday with a couple of friends.  All I can say is that it was yummy and a huge improvement in positioning from what I recall of my last visit to their Arcadia location (a couple years ago).  I remember previously thinking that Postino was little more than an average but trendy neighborhood spot.  This time around my only recommendation besides improving the beer menu (only one local brew!) is that they perhaps drop the price of the bruschetta by about $3-$5.  For afternoon snacks and drinks I thought $45 for two was pushing it a little.',4
'Come on folks yelp only works if were honest and this place is all about 5 star prices for 2 star food and service.  I cant even give it a 2 star because of the deception.  Im guessing this place caters to people who live the diabetes lifestyle . . . sorry.  High fat high sugar high sodium and large portions. I have never been served a saltier main course than I had here.  You could not taste the food only salt. The chefs solutions to mid quality ingredients seemed to be to keep adding more - every dish had too many ingredients and was large.  They have small portions on the menu yet the waitress dissuaded us from them in most cases.  This is the kind of place that makes a salad unhealthy. The servers and bus people kept insisting how great everything (food & drinks) was when it simply wasnt.  The service was fine if you dont mind asking for every single thing at least three times.  I get that they were run off their feet but whats a diner to do? On a positive note he ambiance was nice the staff were nice and I was given a good wine recommendation.',1
'I went to one of the temporary ones to get our 2010 and 2011 taxes done (had issues using Turbo Tax to file last year).  So after being quoted around $200 to do each return I decided OK lets try.  My husband usually does it himself with Turbo Tax but since it had issues with the first-time homebuyer credit last year and kept returning the forms we decided to try a live person and we figured $400 wouldnt be too bad.    Well after spending hours there because the guy was so slow typing everything in- he kept making mistakes that my husband and I corrected- we ended up with a $579 bill.  Not sure how it happened- he said because we itemized etc.  I dont know why we werent quoted at a higher rate.  I left there feeling upset cheated and like a fool.  He tried to give us a $25 coupon like that would really make a difference.  He seemed to understand that it was a lot of money he said it should be free since Im a teacher...blah blah who cares I still had to pay almost $600 right there that I was not expecting to pay.   We will NEVER use a tax service again.  I dont care how desperate I am to get my taxes done.  I will trust my husband to do Turbo Tax or whatever and if we miss out on something fine.  At last I know I didnt pay some guy more than $100 an hour to type numbers into a computer.  What a waste.',1
'Rude server obviously upset that we were not spending tons of money. Terrible bruschetta. Extremely overpriced. EXTREMELY overpriced. If you are going to charge $15 for mac & cheese please provide me with something other than a paper napkin and a plastic cup.',2
'LOVE this place!!!!!!!!! My husband and I discovered it while driving through Del Taco on Dysart. A few weeks later my husband came home with pulled pork bbq and sweet potato casserole. TO.DIE.FOR. I have since gone back and gotten bbq chicken (fantastic meat fell off the bones and still tender) and macncheese (very homey breaded crust pepper lots of cheese perfect). Ill be back soon for more sweet potato casserole. The people there were very friendly too!',5
'I LOVE Trader Joes all locations all over the world. No matter which store I go to the employees are friendly helpful and they love thier job! Its easy to see why too. Its the only place that I can go where I can trust that the food is of the best quality at the very best possible price. All Trader Joes products are GMO free and most of them dont have any perservatives or fillers. Its a wonderful place to shop and its where I spend $85% of my grocery budget.',5
'Durants I wanted to like you. I really did. Im a huge fan of steakhouses particularly ones with as much character as you clearly do. But what you did to my $51 bone-in ribeye was too unspeakable to allow me to recommend this place to anyone. But Im getting ahead of myself.  I was able to get past the fact that the server looked like a mix between an airport bartender and a blackjack dealer at a casino on an indian reservation. In fact I kind of appreciated it as sort of a promising omen of the character and history I expected from the esteemed Durants Steakhouse of Phoenix. Surely this veteran of the steakhouse circuit would have her routine polished and provide a truly memorable experience.  Sadly I was mistaken. She could barely answer simple questions about the cuts of meat coherently. She was slow and inattentive and got our appetizer orders wrong.  OK I can get past that. Just having a bad day right? Well here comes my delicious bone in ribeye mesquite grilled to precisely the just barely medium rare specifications I had so politely and clearly requested.  Wrong again. Perhaps near the bone was an area of steak that one could charitably label medium rare. most of it was much closer to medium and the periphery approached carbonization. In fact I could not finish it (a first for me). Sadly by the time our server reappeared to ask how everything was I was no longer hungry. Of  course she expressed remorse and offered to make it right (bringing the table a complementary order of passable strawberry shortcake) but it was going to take more than strawberry preserves poundcake and whipped cream to get the taste of charcoal out of my mouth.  If you want excellent steak as much as it pains me to say it stick with Ruths Chris or Mastros. If you want Old Phoenix flavor and are OK with rolling the dice with your meat preparation give Durants a shot.',3
'I had a delightfully salty sandwich. Although the wait was longer than acceptable---over half an hour---it was about worth it. I probably wont return unless gifted with free time but it was a nice one shot.',4
'I was really impressed with Sports Authority this weekend I dont normally like this place except for their large inventory.  It used to be hard to find someone to help you but this weekend the service was top notch.  Everyone came up and offered to help and one guy was very helpful with our questions.  We bought a few camping chairs since the last ones we bought broke because they were cheap.  He advised us on which would last the longest and he also helped us pick out a pop-up.  We bought a few other things and everyone offered help which is a big deal for me since I would only go to Sports Chalet for this kind of service.  Good to hear the Corporate has gotten involved.',5
'I ate here for lunch yesterday had a cheesesteak fries and large coke cost me around $10.   It was a GOOD meal nothing spectacular.  While not at the top of my list I would eat there again.',3
'Good service very mediocre steak sides and dessert.',2
'It was a quiet night in the Bula friendly greeting from the hostess team. A pleasant red hair Irish lass showed us to our table.  At first seating we were put into an empty corner our waiter Robby was happy to have us. He gave a crisp recommendation for the combo apps. Robbie my man good call. Wings skins fish and yummy dippings ranch sour cream and tartar. Loved the frosted beer glasses not your typical bar glass really liked it.  We had an eclectic parade of people sitting in our section week day early evening probably has a different feel than other times.  Robbie made another good call on sword fish & halibut recommendations. We really liked his humor and repartee. Nice job Robbie!',4
'Nice nice folks pretty consistent inventory.  Their 3 gs for $45 less $5 for an AARP cardholder is a bargain.  Highly....reccomend!',5
'Great climb!  Nice and technical for a climber with no gear.  Great view of the city from the top.  I would suggest getting dropped off to avoid the parking issues here.',5
'The food was so good I over ate . Mixing the green sauce and the red was the perfect amount of heat.     This place may be hard to find but with it.',5
'Yup in n out of chicken',4
'I want this review to reflect heavily on the food at Dicks Hideaway! The atmosphere was fantastic and exactly what I like...but oh my did Richardsons do one hell of a job in the kitchen. I really didnt even know just how much I adored New Mexican style food until I ate here.   I went here for breakfast and got the carne adovada and my girlfriend went with the chile rellenos. The adovada was through the roof delicious! Smokey spicy salty and prefectly tender! It was some of the best adovada that Ive experienced period. Fast forward to me getting around to trying the rellenos and you would have seen me with my lower jaw hitting the table (after chewing and swallowing of course). They were incredible; like seriously incredible! My girlfriend won the battle of Whose cuisine will reign supreme? hands down! I must eat those again! The last part of the meal that I feel needs recognition is the grapefruit juice. Sounds silly but it was also amazing. It was so fresh that Im surprised I didnt find some of the peel in it!  Dicks Hideaway is a must try! Richardsonst impressed the hell out of me and I cant wait to go and eat more of their delicious food!',5
'Good Burger and Great Service. The Arizona Peach Ale is my favorite!',4
'Ive been living locally the past 14 years and didnt try the Sugar Bowl until just last night. I love that you can sit at a table and be helped by a server just for dessert. The menu was full of classics and different concoctions of ice creams sauces and other sweets--the hardest part of our visit there was making a decision. I opted for the Buster Brownie (sub out the chocolate for caramel) my boyfriend enjoyed the Top Hat Sundae and OMG--yumbo.   Overall this place has the right price impressive dessert and a super cute atmosphere. Great date night spot for Old town Scottsdale.',4
'This place is a greasy spoon and I love it.  When I walked in the door I knew that it was my kind of place.  I thought to myself Feels good to mingle with these laid back country folk.  It has the atmosphere of a small town diner.  I actually forgot for a moment that I was in the heart of one of the biggest cities in the United States.  The food is top notch too. For whatever reason I enjoy my lunch and dinners to be a bit gourmet but my breafast to be greasy and simple.  I got three pancakes three eggs 2 pieces of sausage and hashbrowns all for $6.25.  These days its hard to find a deal like this.  I would recommend this place to people looking for a small town diner feel tasty food and good prices.',4
'THE Best Veggie burrito Ive ever had! The beans and rice are great too. And...a very filling dinner and drinks for two for under $18!!! Cant beat that!',5
'Id shop here again. I like how Petco is cheaper than Petsmart and the stores seem more organized. 2 for 5 toys is awesome as well.',3
'Very fresh delicious donuts and pastries including fancy donuts teas and coffees in the drive-through its a little bit difficult for the people taking in order to understand you so check your bags before you pull away because it may not be adequate Ive asked first couple different things and got something totally different than that great delicious donuts if you there at 2 AM most of the donuts are still warm when you going to them Yum Yum.',4
'I must  have been in a funky mood. Maybe I shouldnt have mixed sushi and Thai food together. Because I didnt think the food is so wonderful today. The beef salad is probably the best dish I have.  The lemongrass chicken is bland.',2
'Rosemary chicken was scrumptious! The  mustard cream sauce was a great complement. One pasty will definitely fill you up. Then share some fries and youre golden! They have a variety of pasties and I want to try more! It is almost like a calzone but better...gourmet hot pocket!  Oven chips or awesome fries are fantastic with jalapeno. YUMMMM.   I brought it all to-go but Id like to eat in because the ambiance seems chill and pretty rad.',5
'Common eat spot for my work peeps. People literally fly in for the Big Rigg! I somehow always order and pay for a cookie but never see it though. Suppose its just some sort of karmic fat tax',4

'First time here new favorite. You can create your own antipasti plate and the pretzels and fondue are AMAZING. Also the ricotta gnocchi is the best I have ever had. Service was good Liz was our waitress and she was very friendly and helpful. Monkey bread is also stellar. I cannot wait to go back.',5
'My wife and I had a great evening at Tanzy on New Years Eve.  The restaurant is beautiful with a cool sophisticated vibe.  The service and food were excellent.   We will definitely be back!',4
'I stop here every Monday night and negate two hours of spinning and yoga by indulging in Mexican comfort food. My wife swears by the carne asado tacos; the cheese enchiladas ring my bell. Although I phone in my order the parking lot is always an adventure. However the one night a young Hispanic girl celebrating her birthday in the restaurants limited outdoor sitting area insisted I come over for a glass of milk and slice of her cake negated all the encounters with strange transients.',5
'Came here for lunch at 11:20am it was not too packed yet.  My brother got there 10 mins later.  We both ordered.  I got the Chicken Philly Pita.  My favorite!!!   This location did not disappointment either.  Woot woot!!!',4
'Im a big fan of this place based on my two visits here. Me and the lady feel like its our own little joint since weve been the only ones there both times weve gone.  All the rolls have been great. As you stand in line to order they have color pictures of all the rolls so you can see exactly what youre getting. Ive had the Vegas sushi burro tuna roll cucumber roll love roll and one or two other I cant remember the names of and they have all been great. Fresh tasty flavorful....good times. All the prices are reasonable too as some other reviews mentioned. You wont get that look on your face like I paid $9 for this? which seems to happen with sushi sometimes. And we had soybeans and one of the salads which had a great dressing on it.  They have a small but good beer selection. Sake bombers are $6 all day which is a price normally found only at happy hour at other places. They advertise the $6 bombers with Kirin but I get Asahi and I believe they give me the same price. Plus you get to choose hot or cold sake.  I like the interior design. Nice clean and modern but not trendy to the point of being cheesy. Plus I love how people can sign and decorate their sake bottles and they have them all on display. Im secretly jealous that I havent done it but I get hot sake which doesnt come in the green bottles.  All in all Im a big fan of Cafe Wasabi and will try and make it whenever Im craving sushi. I dont know how busy they are on weekends or later in the evening. Ive gone around 5-6ish on weekdays both times and weve been the only ones dining in. I hope theyre usually busier than that because Id hate to see the place go out of business.  One more note: Closed on Sundays! Thats maybe the only negative I can find.',4
'I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment  an entree each and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay) chicken taquitos (yay) cheese quesadilla (nay) and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal and see if they can execute more flavorful food.',3
'The French bread is great with a nice crust. The beignets are the best. Fried fresh to order.',5
'Awesome selection even during summer hours.  I came home with my 60 pounds sorted through and divided out what my boyfriend and I would be able to eat in 2 weeks then went to work putting together an assortment of produce for neighbors and friends.  A great value and a great way to help your community.',5
'I went here based on the reviews i saw. Which almost all of them were 4 stars. The atmosphere was cute...especially if you have children who like to run around. I found the food to be okay. Nothing special and really overpriced for what you get.',3
'The Chicken Mole tacos are phenomenal The salsa bar is the best Ive ever had.  By far. La Condesa is a must try.....then you will be back... - M',4
'I had previously edited this review due to the building owner (not the business owner mind you) being very pet UNfriendly and not allowing dog on the property/patio. I guess the business owner has come to an agreement with the building owner ... not sure what that is but the place does deserve a 5 star not withstanding.',5
'The crunchy pork tacos are the best tacos in Arizona! They are delicious you really cant find better tacos anywhere else. They even won 1st place at the most recent Arizona Taco Festival. Its also has the best patio in old town',5
'Pretty pretty good.  This place is tucked away behind The Bentley Projects just south of downtown Phoenix.  You cant see it from the street and theres not really anything around except some empty lots and the gallery; apparently you just need to be in the know ... and you want to be in the know.  Nice outdoor seating not too crowded and great food.  Its a lunch place and the menu was mostly upscale salads and sandwiches (brie goat cheese sundried tomatoes etc.).  I just stuck with the turkey club on focaccia and it was mmm good.  It also came with a white bean salad that was really good.    Plus the dessert and drinks looked/were fantastic.  I really want to try the banana pudding and the frozen hot chocolate (which I tried to order but I think the waitress said they were out of chocolate what?).  They had a bunch of crazy-but-amazing-sounding lattes cute mini-cakes (I had the carrot cake which was good but a little too much on the frosting; I could barely taste the cake) and super-good looking cookies (I bought a cute bunny rabbit sugar cookie for my friend and it was sitting on my desk all afternoon its little bunny eyes taunting me and daring me to bite off one of its bunny ears).  Downsides -- The service was slow the indoor seating didnt look too great (the music inside was yuck) and its not exactly cheap (cookies were three dollars mini-cakes were five and I think the cheapest sandwich was nine bucks).',4
'As it would happen choosing The Mission as a place to pre-game the evenings events was the best decision my crew made all night. (For my sakes anyway).  There was the ambiance.... The ambiance here envelopes you much like that first wave of warmth you get from a vicodin scotch and Red Bull blast. In fact this place is so warm and cozy itll make you feel like youre back in the womb flipping off the ultrasound technician.  The service... Perched at their communal high top a long and double-sided table adjacent to the bar our server was more attentive than a lion tamer with a big stick. This made it an absolute certainty I would lose the first of my five senses in a very short period...hearing. The weird thing about those communal tables is how you never know who youre going   to sit next to. Who do I get? A gaggle of what I can only conjecture were church ladies whom at my merely uttering (90 decibels) the word FUCK would violently and in unison snap their heads in my direction. Now this was fun. Yes my prodigious cursing made for quite the theatrics as with the same precision of Old Faithful five heads would whip about on cue giving me the skunk-eye. What a hoot.  The Food.... The food was well Im not sure. It looked and smelled good but I was down to three senses by the time we finally ordered. Sadly taste much like Elvis had left the building at that point. Good thing for our dates who were quick to inform us (routinely droning on throughout the meal) about how delicious everything was. (Blah Blah Blah)  The bill for four of us came to two hundred twelve dollars before tip. We had drinks some very cool looking appetizers enough chips and salsa to feed a small Ethiopian village a bevy of drink and some entrees whose names I couldnt remember if my life depended on it.  As I said pre-gaming at the Mission was the best decision we made all night.  Who could ever know that with one well-timed (and perhaps highly audible) FUCK I held the awesome power to control my very own Womens Synchronized Scowling Team. For at least one night of my miserable existence I WAS omnipotent.  Thanks Mission.',5
'I really like Zinc. The food has been excellent every time I have been here and the service has always been great. This is a great place to go on a Sunday afternoon to sip champagne and people watch.   The decor is awesome looks very authentic and they have a great patio that is perfect when the weather is nice.   The prices arent anything out of the norm for this type of restaurant and considering it is in the middle of Kierland it is fairly unpretentious something I love about it.   One thing I have noticed though this would not be a vegetarian friendly restaurant. I am a bit of a picky eater when it comes to meat and sometimes I have trouble with the menu. But that is with all French food they like their meat. However the staff has always been very accommodating to my eccentricities:) The onion soup is fabulous by the way and my friend loves their mussels he gets them every time we go.',5
'Cheap GOOD drinks good sushi great happy hour decent location. Not too shabby.  Be advised get their early as this place does fill up fast on certain days.. (Usually Thursdays and Fridays)! The patio is for the smokers so if you are a smoker you will be happy to have your own little section. Oh and the DJ is pretty damn good to. Especially on Fridays :)',4
'So we walk in at 11:15 AM. and the place is completely empty. (This is during peak college year). The disappointment of not seeing any hot ASU broads was only the beginning of a variety of disappointments during this lunch. So lets start with the good. The waitress was nice. Ok now the bad: I ordered the lunch special pizza which was an 8 inch pizza and a drink for like $6. The waitress warned me that the pizza was extremely small (at least i think she was talking about pizza) so anyways i ordered 2 of them. When the pizza came out I wouldnt have been surprised if i saw part of a Digornos pizza box stuck to the bottom of the pizza. What is wrong with pizza in Arizona?! Ive never been to big city where saying the word Dominos causes very moist orgasms.  Mellow Mushroom tries way too hard with the crust they sprinkle this garlic dust all over it and it sucked. It tasted like you were trying to eat an old shiny piece of bread. The cheese was so thick and rubbery you could probably use it to cover severe war wounds  This place blew big ones it had cool decorations on the walls but i cant  friggin eat decorations.',2
'I use to like going to this gym but obviously the new manager has really messed up a solid gym. First thing he does is move everything around its like a dog peeing on everything to leave his mark. Why screw up a perfectly set up place just to validate your coming. The space usage is seriously flawed and now the free weights have 6 options to stand in instead of 15 where the station was. The free weights section is now in a pathway where everybody uses so it is somewhat dangerous to walk by while people are swinging weights doing curls. Then they turn all the stationary machines at a 45 degree angle so you stare off in a weird direction and it takes up more room. Not to mention placing several stationary units in front of a yoga/zumba room front door. When class lets out they fight to get through the machines. somebody is going to get hurt. I brought it up to the new manager who brushed my opinions aside and went on about his business. Management if you are reading this get a clue. I am not the only one who objected. The guy next to me said this sheet sucks now what were they thinking.',1
'Whoah. The most authentic Chicago dog in Phoenix. Other places (Lukes Chicago Hamburger Als) can learn a thing or two. First off the place is spotless. Its nice to eat at a place where the restaurateur understands that keeping his place clean is an important aspect of the customer experience. Nice not to have dusty nasty t-shirts hanging from the walls. The fries here are also better comparable to other valley Chi-dog eateries. They perfectly match. This will now be a required stop along the way for any trip to/from northern AZ.  The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the beef sandwich. Sorry guys but my gold standard for thin sliced Italian beef is Portillos (Joeys beef was almost twice as thick the bread didnt have that toasted flaky feel and the gravy just didnt do it for me).',4
'I have no idea why people are giving this place such rave reviews! The food was mediocre at best and I was not impressed at all. I wanted to like the place because I live about 5 minutes away. The food was about as good as Dennys which is not saying much. I had an Italian sausage sandwich on multigrain bread. The bread looked and tasted like basic cheap store bought bread. I guess I was expecting fresh baked bread instead of something I could make at home. I was also surprised that our sandwiches did not come with fries potato chips or some kind of potato salad or slaw. Most places include something other than the two tiny pickles with a sandwich. My husband wouldnt even try the pickles because he said it looked like something that had been thrown on the floor. I tried the pickle and was kinda grossed out because it was soggy. Ive never had a soggy pickle in my life. I also ordered scrambled eggs for my toddler and once again I felt the eggs I make at home taste better. My husband did enjoy his bacon sandwich but also felt the bread was mediocre. We also ordered a margherita pizza to share. The pizza was the worst disappointment of all. It came on a thin lavosh bread which is more like a extra thin flat bread. It did not taste fresh. I even looked at pictures on yelp of the pizza and what we were served looked nothing like those pictures. I have to wonder if they changed  the pizza or if the pictures posted on yelp are fake.',1
'i was recently married here.9/14/2013.. im going to be brutally honest.. this was a disaster from day 1. we were one of the last if not LAST people to be able to be married in the Wine Bar area.   I felt like i was second best to the big barn bride i was made to feel my $5000 was below them.   I was given 3 different coordinators from Feb 13 to Aug 13 because they all quit working there. Now... i understand that maybe this is out of their hands.. but it made every step tough emails were lost (i saved mine) agreements were not kept.  I had to be very flexible to accommodate the big barn bride at all times. I wasnt allowed to have photos taken by certain things i wasnt able to just walk out of a the bridal cottage because we dont want to inconvenience the big barn bride who wasnt in there and her things that were. she rented the cottage its hers so you are not able to step out of the door so i was taken from my bridal room to the back of the bridal cottage (the office) to stand and wait in the heat.. but because the big barn bride was taking photographs.. i had to be taken back to the bridal room so she didnt see me... then not even 5 min later.. i was walked back over to the office area because she was done with her pictures. Mind you during this entire time my guests have arrived they all have seen me at this point.. to include my fiance.. so the first look walking down the aisle was gone.. the one thing he asked for .. i dont want to see her before the wedding.. that was the ONLY tradition we wanted.   During the ceremony..the groom grooms men and my girls were not in the right order the bridesmaids were not handed their flowers. I was told upon asking..where are their bouquets? the answer was...oh well i guess they forgot to grab them.. Isnt that what your there for? to line everyone up in order make sure they are on time maybe see they dont have the bouquets. and hand them to them.. if its not .. then wouldnt you do it out of sheer courtesy?  once the main manager (Katie) saw the girls didnt have bouquets.. her jaw dropped and my coordinator was dismissed.. i didnt see her the rest of the night until i started packing up decorations and she handed me a bottle of wine..  to top it off.. nobody did anything about the cock fight that was happening in the drive way... it wasnt until in the middle of my ceremony when i said.. someone kill that turkey! and a laugh.. (movie quote) then out of the corner of my eye.. i see the owner running over to sho them away.. (thank you sir.. you saved the last 5 minutes of my wedding video)   at two months before the wedding they literally told me if i didnt want to get married at the time of day they picked out (because any earlier time would have interfered with the big barn bride) i could take my money elsewhere.  I was in tears the entire time i had to speak to them i was nervous opening up emails from them because i was so worried they were going to cancel on me..   i wasnt asking for things to be above and beyond i was just asking for courtesy.  i would have done anything for the other bride to have her day be special too..  when i found the booth at the January phoenix bridal show i knew this is where i wanted to be married.. it was and is an absolutely beautiful location..i should have listened to a few people who used to work there (a manager photographer and a cake decorator) say i shouldnt.. now i know why.. maybe for 2 thousand more ($7000 is the price for the big barn) dollars i would have been treated better.. but i didnt want that large of a wedding.. i just wanted something small. intimate and quaint..  closest friends and family.. i could have filled the big barn to the brim with people but it wasnt what i wanted.   but i did and still do feel like i was second best and that i was a burden on them.   but on that note...there are certain people i want to give a 5 star rating to.   The bar staff.. the bar staff was an absolute joy! they helped with clean up because they saw me doing it. (cleaning the dishes from the table) Specifically would like to say thank you to Chris specifically.. You made my sister in law feel so special when you helped her carry water bottles!   The DJ. DJ Ramsey Saba you got everyone out of your seat.. I LOVED the music you put together! and thank you thank you for making us a wedding copy.. now we will have the music every anniversary to come.   the Caterer: 5 star catering and Chef Le.. the food was amazing..  The bakery Lesleys cakes.. Absolutely fantastic! Cant wait to share the word.. i will also be coming back in a year to get a remake! :)   Sarahs garden: as i said to you. i loved them.. the boquets were lovely. just wish they would have made it into the ceremony.. and after..',2
'Not really thrilled with this place.  I expected more of an interesting beer selection.  The food was good but nothing to rave about.  Our salads and entrees arrived back to back which I was not thrilled about.  The inside was nice and the staff friendly.  My husband and I agreed that it was not good enough to go back to.',2
'I love the open area concept of the interior of the restaurant. There are no obtrusive walls a lot of natural light and you can even see the kitchen. Both the east and west sides open up which was great when I walked in one Sunday afternoon in January while the sun was shining and the air was cool and crisp. On either side of the restaurant are patios where you can either lounge or enjoy your meal. It was a enjoyable spot for me as I waited to be seated.  Our waiter Rodney (very friendly guy) inquired if we were familiar with True Food Kitchen and asked if we would like to know the story behind it; not necessary but certainly a great welcoming intro. Before coming in I eyed the menu available on their website and already knew what I wanted. I had the Grass-fed Bison Burger. I never had bison before but had always wanted to try it. It was everything I had hoped it would be. The burger was light but had that wonderful grill flavor. The burger was a little smaller than what Im use to but I believe this leaves up to the concept of healthy but flavorful theme of the restaurant. My sides were diced-sweet potatoes and a salad. First off  you can rarely go wrong with sweet potatoes. Second the salad was wonderful; again it lived up to the theme of the restaurant. I dont completely recall what type of dressing was used but Im sure it was some sort of vinaigrette. For desert I shared a flour-less chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The flour-less cake was another first for me and I was intrigued by the idea and it did not disappoint. It wasnt a good idea to share this though as it was gone too soon. Next time Im getting one for myself only.  True Food Kitchen is one my new favorites and Im excited to visit again!',5
'Ok.. I stopped by after seeing the 5 star reviews..and peeps at work were really wanting a Gyro..it was good but not great. It wasnt bad...but King Gyro and Chicago Gyro have a larger meatier Gyros and (IMHO) better sauce... The Gyro special was $5.99- real good price for what you get; gyro fries and can of soda. As mentioned in the other reviews- they have about 10 other $6 - $7 meal deals...  NUTSHELL- Nice fast service Good value for the price..I will eat here again.',4
'went to House during Restaurant Week and in celebration of our 22nd wedding anniversary. the whole visit started out weird when we walked in and werent greeted. there is no one in the front room you then have to walk through a bar room with a ton of empty tables. bartender was busy chatting it up with waitress to say hi. we found the host station only to be ignored by a host who obviously cannot multitask. after standing around awkwardly for about 5 minutes we were greeted (stared at until we said something). we requested to sit outside but given that it was our anniversary we would appreciate a table not right next to the family with the baby.  we were told ill try but it wont bite.  swell.  we were placed at a lovely table (away from the baby as one could get but its a small patio...and the parents seem oblivious to the wails) that had misters pointing right at us from the ground. surprised the plants werent frostbit as we had to continuously move our legs they were so cold.   our waitress informed us that for restaurant week the whole table either had to do it or not which we found odd since none of the RW offerings were unique...they were just off the menu. as my husband wanted the mussels app we decided to go with the regular menu even though i ate 2 of the three courses from the RW menu and paid extravagantly more than the RW menu.  we ordered two glasses of prosecco (no offer of on the house due to our celebration but thats okay..even though every other restaurant weve ever eaten at for our anniversary has offered that up) and commenced on our apps. i had the pork belly with dried figs and pistachios. some bites were great some were lackluster. it didnt have the fatty quality that i adore in pork belly...in fact some parts were downright dry. and the serving size was huge...it could have been a main course for many.  hubby has osso bucco which he enjoyed. i had a butternut squash ravioli with pesto which was decent but nothing out of the ordinary at all. we ordered polenta fries with aioli and when we reminded our waitress it was obvious she or the kitchen forgot...we waited another 10 plus minutes for the kitchen to make them.  they were outstanding.  desserts were okay....some great ice cream from a local place and some fig ricotta beignets with three dipping sauces.  the beignets were a bit dry but the toppings were great.  had to wait forever for our check and then to get it taken care of. there were many delays between courses and refills of water glass and waitress smelled of obvious cigarette smoke on her returns. guess we were second-place to her ciggie breaks.   on the way out there were no thank yous...just another stare from the one thing at a time host....guess he was busy holding the door open for us so he couldnt say anything....',2
'The quirky name drew me in but the craft beer selection is what really won me over. A personal fave is the Bells Two Hearted Ale with its delightful balance of hops and malt. It goes fast when they have it as the taps rotate regularly to ensure fresh options from local and national brewers. The boneless wings are moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The selection of sauces (lemon pepper is my addiction) will have you licking your fingers and counting your lucky stars. If you want to indulge order the fried pickles--a Midwest favorite like spears of salty crispy goodness. There are plenty of healthier options such as salads wraps and rice bowls. You wont be disappointed by the witty bartenders and warm service.',5
'This place is quite simply amazing.  To start the atmosphere is excellent especially in front of the Robata grill and is very upscale without being pretentious or snotty.  The drink selection is great and unique: I had several of their shochu infusions and I would recommend them especially the honey and the apple.  We shared several entrees over the course of the evening including the blackened tomato salad marinated pork chop yuzu miso black cod baked green tea custard and the Raspberries and Lychee.  All were delicious and I was surprised by how much I loved the cod.  In general I tend to steer clear of fish entrees (not really a fan) but the black cod was possibly the best thing Ive ever eaten.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.',5
'My boyfriend and I walked into this restaurant to try something new.  We sat outside.  The service was extremely slow.  Our server looked like she was not all there- she could hardly speak in complete sentences and her eyes where rolling around.  We ordered and when our lunch came out - I was totally disgusted by the smell of my plate. I picked at my food and the Quinoa vegetable smelled like sour milk or rotten something. My boyfriend had the roast beef sandwich and the meat was spoiled- he had an upset stomach and soon after he was vomiting. The manager asked us to never show our faces again at the restaurant. Trust US....we wont.  The health department needs to pay a visit to his place.',1
'Stopped here for a quick bite before jumping on the 10 to head back home. The hubs and I both had the chorizo egg potato burrito. It was really good. Usually chorizo can be greasy but this was not. The salsa bar was yummy as well. If your looking for a quick bite come here and give it a try.',4
'This is a brand new location in Goodyear. Since this is so close to our house we decided to visit on opening day. The first thing we noticed was the small parking lot which is not really an issue since there is a lot of parking in the shopping center. The restaurant itself is also on the smaller side and was quite busy when we visited. There was a lot of staff there and everyone was very friendly. Our food came out quickly and was better than average. The dining room was pretty loud but I am pretty sure it was because of the opening day excitement. Hopefully they will maintain the food quality they have right now.',3
'This place is awesome. Even if the wait is long and it normally is not Its worth it. If your in a hurry call ahead. Food is amazing and the price is perfect for the portions. In my opinion this is the best fast Asian food in the valley.',5
'Just got my hair cut today and what a great experience. Charming building Great cut at a terrific value. I got my hair cut a little shorter for the warmer weather and Patrick got it perfect. I was on a break from work and time was critical. I was in and out and most importantly got a shampoo after the cut so wouldnt have hair down my shirt! Saving the best for last...shoulder and back massage afterward then on my way back to work much more relaxed. Top notch salon. I highly recommend it!',5
'Very slow service & expect to feel like an outsider at this location. I went in & was skipped over in line as they began regulars orders ahead of mine. I spent over $40 on beverages & food and not so much as a thank you. Meanwhile they are talking up a storm with the regular clientele. Drinks finally ready & they are out of trays. When I placed an order for 5 beverages how did you think I would get them to the car? No offer of assistance the employee just acted like she couldnt see me. Ill be frequenting a different Starbucks.',2
'Do you snub a place because theyre cheap and you equate cheap with inferior or sub par quality? Do you snub something because people never mention them and they dont get reviewed even once on Yelp?  Shame on you. SHAME ON YOU.  I used to be that person. Im guilty of all of the above especially in regards to the pizza with the a toga-wearing guy who thinks hes funny. I know I know shame on me.  I was introduced to this place when I first came to the states almost 20 years ago I was young then and my cousin was even younger. Fast-forward almost 20 years I found myself ordering stuff from this place while I was visiting the Phoenix metro area. He swore by this stuff. He told me how the pizza was NOT half-bad and the price made it more appealing. 5 bucks a one topping pizza how can anyone refuse? Additional toppings extra and so are thin crusts and deep dish but thats to be expected.  Remember they dont deliver. Thats how the keep the prices dirt-cheap. The people there were very nice and was not pushy about upselling anything. They also have dipping sauces which I got the garlic butter one. They have chilled soft-drinks and thats a good thing since its hot here. They also have the infamous Crazy Bread. Gotta taste it to believe it.  So you ask why did I give four stars to a place that I snubbed till this place changed my mind? Take notes heres the formula:  Cheap pizza + Ok pizza + convenient location + nice people and service + my attitude adjustment = 4 stars!  Did you get that? The lesson you should learn:  Dont knock it till you try it.',4
'This Indian restaurant is one of the best and most authentic I have ever eaten at.  I went for the lunch buffet and the price and quantity of foods was huge but more importantly the QUALITY of the food was incredible.  Now that I have had a test of everything available I will definitely keep this on my short list for dinner.',5
'Ive been to Cocos before and probably a few of them.  Even this one a while back.  However Ive been to this location twice in two weeks and have never been happier.    BE sure to get Amanda as your server. Shes awesome and knows her stuff.  The second time we all showed up she literally pointed at each of us and told us our drink order.. we never said a word.  It was awesome.  Right now Cocos is doing their holiday food so dont miss out on the great tastes they have going on.  My personal favorite at Cocos is their Turkey Jack Croissant.  I get it all the time and Im never disappointed.    Best time to is during the week in the evenings. They gave great breakfasts so you can also order that in the evening time.  If you go on a Sat or Sun morning... get ready to wait.  The place is packed!',4
'I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!',2
'We had Thanksgiving dinner at The Keg and normally I really like that restraint but not this time.  We had 3:30 reservations and did not receive any food until 5:00.  The food was tasteless bland not good.  I gave 2 starts because the staff worked so hard and were all extremely friendly.  Even the manager was serving drinks and running food.  But as for the food it self we could of probably got a better dinner at Dennys.',2
'Went here with some of my girlfriends for a birthday dinner. We called ahead and had no problems getting a table for a party of 8. We were seated immediately. The decor here is more upscale than most Mexican food restaurants. Kind of a courtyard feel.   Loved their frozen margaritas. It came with a swirl of sangria. The food was very light not heavy or greasy like a lot of Mexican food restaurants. Great mix of combinations so you can try a few different things. I had the Laredo and was not disappointed. The food arrived promptly and our server was very attentive the whole night.',4
'The staff is super friendly.  I am there almost every day to pick up my mail or a package and I have never had a bad experience.  They are especially good at logging packages into their system right away so you can receive an e-mail delivery notice asap.  The only tough thing about the location is the parking.  Because its close to Pita Jungle and Wildflower parking is difficult during lunch time.  But thats not their fault...',5
'Excellent prices and the people working there are friendly. CLEAN inside unlike other Mexican rests in the area. The taste of the food is at top game and love eating at this place!',4
'The staff put up with my poop & they are classy for doing so. (Not real poop)',4
'While their menu can sound a little ya-ya like their food is definitely worth trying. Highly recommend the chicken protein plate.',5
'Somewhat slow service expected with new staff though. Sandwich took about 15 mins to get but was fairly tasty if not a bit messily constructed. Nothing earth-shattering but exceptional choices this menu runs deep! The bread is good too. Overall I think it just needs some time to come into its own.',3
'I have two favorite sushi places:  here & awhautukee!!!  :-)',5
'I think the only Fat Tuesdays in Arizona one of the best original bars on mill ave. I love the friendly service and how the waiters/waitress kept checking up on us. Tuesdays is happy hour all day so if ya need that quick pick me up or feeling like you need a drink days its a must go and check it out. Large daiquiris are 5.50 so might as well right? Only on Tuesdays tho! I had the loaded fries and shared it with a friend pretty legit! And enough for a lot 2 maybe 3. Overall a place to check out if your looking for a fun time if you know what I mean!',4
'I do indeed love Apple products. I bought my first Apple computer -- a little iBook -- in 2002 when I began grad school. I bought a 2nd generation iPod too (it was as heavy as a brick). Im not going to lie this commercial sold me on giving Apple a try:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GxC4kKD9qA  Still that doesnt change the fact that the computer successfully carried me through my masters degree. Id have to check but I think my diploma was made out to iBook rather than Chad.  This particular Apple store is great; not only does it sell amazing products but Ive never had a problem getting a faulty device replaced. I once had an iPhone die on me and they simply handed me a new one. Also I brought a 3-year-old laptop in hoping for a free fan repair; they couldnt waive that cost but they did go the extra mile and look into my battery while they were at it then replace it. Yes it sounds like Ive had a lot of faulty Apple products but when I think about how many purchases Ive made here I think its par for the course (especially when I think about my disastrous experiences with Dell and HP).  Im bringing my Macbook Pro into the Apple Store today in the hopes theyll be able to take care of a stuck pixel or two; its annoying to try to watch a movie with a stationary white spot on the screen especially when the cost of this computer is the reason I still have no dishwasher in my house!',4
'WORTH THE WAIT.  An Avant-garde trendy Modern establishment with the BEST damn pizza under the sun. Think of going to Pizzeria Bianco as an experience not just  getting dinner.  Expect long waits on most days if you dont want to get there early enough to be seated immediately. Theres a wine bar next door where you will find yummy cheese platters and vino. Which means you can sip and snack while you wait in line. Give yourself about 3 hours for the entire experience and after making a reservation check out the pub just across the way (if you have to wait a while). They have great beer my favorite onion rings a pool table and indoor-outdoor seating (just be sure to keep checking back to make sure you dont get passed up!)   Although each magnificent My favorite Pizzas are:   Sonny Boy(Tomato Sauce Fresh Mozzarella Salami Gaeta Olives)    Rosa:   (Red Onion Parmigiano Reggiano Rosemary AZ Pistachios) Im a regular here and the service and quality is always the same: MAESTRO WORK... Eat well live well and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers',5
'Ive been going to BJs for lunch since they opened.  The food is 5/6 on a scale of 10 but what brings me back is the atmosphere.  Its very comfortable and inviting whether a party of two or twelve.  Its a must lunch for out of town guests due to the handcrafted beer selection.  Always a hit and now a tradition.  First BJs - then bowling.  After a few Ales Blondes Stouts and Reds no one cares how many pins they knock down (hee hee hee)!  If you havent been you should go!  I prefer lunch.  Dinner is crowded.',4
'Closed. Out of business at least when trying to check the place out on July 14 2010.',1
'This is our second time being here for the money you get plenty of food and the wing sauces they have are good. Overall an excellent value will come back again. The mango habanero sauce is my fav than comes the teriyaki  forget the Cajun sauce.',4
'Maybe it was an off day or something for this place..  Stopped in for lunch today its a Saturday.  Place is in a strip mall.  Decorations are something you would see in party city around Mardi Gras time (pretty cheesy).  Service was nice and friendly.  Now lets get down to the food part of this.   Im very hesitate to say but I must it wasnt good.. Yes Ive read the other reviews but Ive been and lived in New Orleans and I have to say I dont think this should be called Cajun.  The flavors are so bland I couldnt taste any spice at all on anything.  Food seemed really dry like it might have been sitting awhile. My husband and I ordered the Boudin Balls for an app.  Now those were decent.  I ordered a Shrimp Poboy and my husband ordered the Jambalaya.  My shrimp Poboy had old bread and was cut in half with 4 medium size shrimps on each half. sorry not enough shrimp for a sandwich that cost nearly 11 bucks at lunch.  The Remoulade sauce only had one flavor... Horseraddish it was super strong and was awful.  So eh on the Poboy it came with a side of burnt homemade potato chips ate like one and decided to pass on the plate of them. I felt really bad though looking at my husbands plate.  It was a stacked high rice dish with these shriveled up sausages thrown on the side of the dish.  I had a taste of his first the rice... really dry.. Then I took a little bit of this beef jerky sausage it was so dry and had no taste at all.  I told him he must dump hot sauce all over that dish because there is nothing going on there.   So yeah.. not sure if its what we ordered or what but Flavors of Louisiana is way better if your craving Cajun food in the valley. P.S.  My husband ordered Tea its wasnt Louisiana Tea nor sweet as they make it in the south... would have been nice to have been given the option for sweet tea!',2
'I live only a couple minutes away from this restaurant so Im a frequent customer. The gyros are of course excellent but some of their other dishes are a bit mediocre. I would not recommend the meatball sandwich the Chicago dog or the pasta but I would most certainly recommend the gyros! I gave this place one extra star because of the friendly and cute staff. Their service will make you feel right at home.',4
'Angela is one of the most brilliant women I know. she is always on top of things and knows the best ways to avoid paying Uncle Sam too much. The previous reviewer obviously didnt give her the correct information. The other people in the Taxanistas office are very capable and do a great job. I recommend this office highly.',5
'Great park with open spaces softball fields basketball courts and sand volleyball courts in addition to the tennis center. I walk here almost every day when visiting Scottsdale.',4
'The best simple pizza I ever had.  Waited zero mins on a Saturday lunch.  I guess it was too built up...I mean it was excellent pizza...but nothing mind blowing.   Is it worth waiting zero mins for table...absolutely.   2-3 hour wait...not a chance.',5
'If you are a Verizon customer find another store.  They have no clue what customer service is nor do they care.  They are a bunch of comissioned sales people that care about one thing...selling phones.  They sold my son a Samsung to replace an iPhone and the transition (contacts pictures etc.) was a nightmare.  The store personel offered absolutely no assistance.  They basically said that they were busy and didnt have time to help or talk with him.  He spent 6 - 8 hours on technical phone support and they were extremely helpful.  If we had an option we would switch all our accounts from Verizon but our son lives in a remote area of California and Verizon is the only option.',1
'They get 5 out of 5 starts for their Monday - Wednesday SUPER AWESOME 2 meals for $14.99 deal!  That is right kiddos ALL DAY -- not just limited to lunch.  My co-worker and I have become weekly regulars and the staff is always polite nice and considerate.  If there is ever a problem they quickly correct it and are very receptive to special requests.   Seriously where else can you get a steak dinner for $7.50 each AND get to throw peanuts on the floor without your mom yelling at you or you having to clean them up!?  Also the unlimited free hot buttery melt-y and delicious sweet dinner rolls are AMAZING!  (note: do not check calorie content of the rolls before visiting.... it will ruin the pure bliss enjoyed while devouring the rolls).  Also you can opt for healthier options here much easier than you can a burger place (salad chicken or steak and steamed broccoli easily does the trick!)  Overall even without the super amazing deal Monday - Friday I enjoy this place and will continue to go back.  (p.s. did I mention the free rolls!?)',5
'This is becoming one of my favorite spots to hang out in downtown Phoenix. Firstly all of the workers here are friendly. Secondly the food is great (My favorites are the AZ burger Chicken salad sandwich or the pulled pork sandwich). Thirdly they have one of the best happy hours in town. 3pm-close you can get half priced cocktails wine and for 5 dollars you can get a pitcher of beer which is perfect for hanging out with a friend. Their selection isnt incredible but everything they have is good.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try!',5
'*burp*  Cripes this was some good food!  Pleasantly full not like Thanksgiving.  I just HAD to have the #28 noodles.  Rice noodles with mock pork and egg roll on top bean sprouts lettuce cucumbers and peanuts.  The bowl was HUGE!!!!!!!!!!! I went with Robert M. and Bacon and they had gotten there before me and had a couple appetizers ordered already.  Two different kinds of spring rolls: shrimp and pork.  This is a vegetarian restaurant so all the meat was mock.  Each order had two huge rolls enough food for the three of us to split. The boys got the #41 - soy chicken speared with lemongrass and a tofu dish.  Everything was delicious! Then the boba.  Ive been a fan of boba forever and am soooooo glad theres a place in CenPho that has it!  Robert and I got the taro and coconut smoothies with boba.  Bacon had the Chai with boba.  We also got to taste the avocado.  Soooooooo good I will dream of it more than my last date.  That wasnt even worthy of a nightmare it was so uneventful. The owner was awesome and took his time to answer questions and explain the dishes and how to eat them.  Did you know that the Buddhist monks do not eat garlic or onions?  Its because they make you horny and thats not good for monks.  Maybe I should cut those out of my diet too. Boba.  The drink you can eat!',5
'I went to Social Tap for happy hour to meet a friend when it first opened. Friendly service drinks were nothing special. Fast forward a year and a half later or so went to their website to check out their lunch special and found their $3 burger deal. Called it in and was rudely told that their site was outdated and have $5 lunch menu now thats not on their website. Girl taking the order was rude. When asked whats on the $5 menu she literally huffed! LOL! and said the menu was for dine-in only for the people over at the Galleria! Duh! Im at the Galleria! Ordered the chicken tenders off that menu for a friend...and if you like micro waved rubbery chicken and bad service--youll like Social Tap. Cant even get myself to give it 1 star!',1
'They got the job done quickly and painlessly but there seemed to be a lot of unnecessary waiting around on the table which is not the most comfortable place. Overall professional and fast though.',4
'Maybe they had a off day.The food here was pretty bad. The chicken in the fried rice looked like it was meat left over from other meals. I guess next time I order from here Ill try something different. If I do.',2
'Very happy with my experience here!  Stopped by on a Wednesday evening (which is apparently a new night for them as they were only open Thurs - Sun) and were able to be seated immediately.  In fact it was pretty empty.  The courtyard area is very cozy / romantic / beautiful.  I love the atmosphere!  The starter (squash with burrata and other yummy things) was delicious!!!  For the main I chose the fish (choices were between fish and pork) and it was good - not great.  I still ate it all but Ive had better.  The dessert was also very good.  Overall it was a great meal and experience.  I liked only having to decide on my main and wine.  The host seemed very passionate and knowledgeable about the food and was very friendly.  (I think we offended him when one person from our table asked for salt - which isnt a negative thing it just shows their passion / confidence in their food!).',4
'Vintage heaven.  I love spending the whole day going shop to shop finding unique items for my house or wardrobe. This is one of my favorite places in Phoenix.',5
'No complaints here. I was there on business and there were clean comfortable beds - the restaurants had great food. The aforementioned speedy Internet was great and there were lots of people who could still move without walkers nestled around the fire pits drinking (and smoking cigars) until bedtime ....  good times.   Just checking out the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture amused me for at least a day. The man had an amazing touch and this is the only Wright hotel in the country. Amazing stonework and beautiful stained glass. Its a place to go if you just want to relax (cause theres nothing much to do here). No fast pace; no rush; not much to do but veg. If you play golf theres a very popular golf course and a nice spa.',4
'Literally the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Everytime I go there the staff members are so unfriendly. I have done plenty of surveys and so have my neighbors who go there and nothing has changed. I went my last time today. My cashier Ashley D was so rude. I told her to have a good day to see if she would even respond since its a trend that they dont respond. She just looked at me and I said wow you guys just never tell anyone to have a good day do you ? She responded sarcastically and said have a fabulous day ! Very sad. I called the manager on shift and didnt seem to care one bit. Very unprofessional. Never will I ever go there again and neither will friends and family who have experienced the same thing. They need to get their act together. Very sad !',1
'Cookies and cream concrete w/ Oreo mix-in. Im still in a diabetic coma. Yet writing a review.  Cant wait to try the food.  Booyakasha!',5
'WoW.. Great Service Great Food.. Typical traditional Diner.. Fabulous.. Enjoy!',5
'Some times the little things make the biggest differences. In this case it was the Agave nectar.  I am not a huge coffee person due to my aversion to caffeine but I was thirsty and was just next door for lunch. I was happy to hear they can decaf just about any drink.  I went with a basic iced decaf american 16 oz for $2.50 seemed like a decent deal.   With the agave nectar and creamer at the dressings station it was quite good.  The place has a real down town hipster feel with a retro sound system and tables that match the macs that people are using.',4
'Called these guys to install in a new gas line for our range.   It was A1 from start to finish. Nice guy showed up on time went right to work and the finished product looked professional. No surprise pricing...it was exactly what they originally quoted.   If you need their service go for it.. no concerns with these guys at all. I wouldnt hesitate next time I need them.',5
'This spice store is amazing!  Three generations of my family swear by it for cooking spices and for many of our favorite family recipes you can only find the right spices at Penzeys.  They have so many kinds of cinnamon and paprika that you cant find anywhere else.  I love to receive their catalog each month and visit the store as they always have free recipes and they are delicious!  If you have felt uninspired by cooking visit this store and discover a whole new world of flavor.  Also their boxed gift sets of spices make fantastic gifts for the holidays.',5
'Pizza is great but ever since they moved the service sucks. Been here  numerous times and they never enough people working to provide good service.... Cmon Barros youre bigger and busier now fix this.',3
'This place is pretty good! I dont know if I will keep coming back for dinner but the cocktails are awesome and the food is good.  The head chef is Brian Malarkey who was on Top Chef and is now on The Taste if you are into cooking reality TV :)  Honestly the ambiance is amazing. Its really a nice place to just hang out have a few drinks and even happy hour is great. The best drink is the peter rabbit . It is pimms basil and has a garnish of a carrot which is pretty neat. As far as the food the cheddar puffs are awesome as is the lamb. It is cooked a little rare but I liked it. The flavor was awesome.  Check out the happy hour for cheaper drinks and apparently there is a brunch which we are looking forward to trying!',3
'Food was not so good. Staff did not look healthy; Whataburger needs to pay their PHX employees more money.',2
'About the same as the rest.',3
'Awesome Dickeys!! Friendly staff amazing food and nothing beats free ice cream!!',5
'Your basic economy lodging: a modest amount of amenities with several flaws.  The rooms are small but functional with a bed small desk and a tiny bathroom. A TV sits on top of a number of dressers although many of the channels had poor reception. Of the more optional items there was a coffee maker as well as a pool out back.  A continental breakfast is served from 5-10 am which appears to be mostly some pastries yogurt cereal as well as a waffle maker. There is a small business office next to the desk where you can use the computer.  The rooms meet basic cleanliness although the walls are on the thin side. Noises from the hall or adjacent rooms can be heard fairly easily. On one night the noises from an amorous couple could be clearly heard which woke me up: as I rolled over I sleepily muttered Get a room. A few moments later it dawned on me that it was in fact exactly what theyd done.  The location is convenient next to the airport: theres very easy access to and from Skyharbor. The downside of this is that you can hear planes on their take-off from one of the runways. Not so much of a problem at night but some of the early morning take-offs could be an issue.   On caveat is that they mention that they are close to the new light rail line. Its actually a fairly long hike: probably near the two mile range to the station near University Ave. Theres possibly one thats closer at Skyharbor but since youd probably have to hike across the runways that may be discouraged.',3
'I go there almost daily and have been for almost 2 years. The manager Michelle is amazing and the staff is always extremely friendly and helpful. I have always had great food fast service and a wonderful experience. It is extremely clean pet friendly outside and I would say to go there every day like I do!!',5
'I discovered this place on my way to a comedy show! It was a Saturday night with an ASU game on and was not packed so we stopped in to get a drink and a bite to eat. First impression was nice! Everything looked clean and open which i didnt expect from the outside appearance.  The service was kinda slow. I have worked in the restaurant/bar industry for 10+ years and I understand how things can go wrong that the customers dont see so i am not going to be hard on these guys. (By the way the girls are all dressed pretty skimpy and the guys are just short of guidos so if you have small kids this may not be the place to bring em) So the drink service was slow and throughout we never were really sure who our server was. One girl took our drink order another brought them someone else took our food order someone else brought our food and someone else came over to see if all was ok... There had to be 15 employees and maybe 25 customers not to mention the kitchen staff.  So the service was slow and not sure why because we were constantly seeing the staff goofing around with one another and as mentioned before it was not busy. BUT the associates were very nice the entire time so it was not bad service my any means just slow and a little unattentive.  It seemed to turn into a club style late at night which could explain the extensive staff.  There is a wheel that you can spin with different actions on it such as kiss a random 50% off bill go plastic (which apparently gives you a chance to win plastic surgery). I would suggest NOT attempting this if you are not single.  Overall the food was GREAT!!!! The place was clean (bathrooms could use attention). The service could use some tweeking. But we were happy with it!',3
'Great food service was quick great place for a quick lunch.',4
'Great place! Our daughter told us she saw it on a food network show and we tried it. The pulled pork sandwich was awesome the beans were amazing and the fries were good. Good portions for the price .',5
'Wow I havent ever had Vietnamese food that wasnt at the least ok. With enough sriracha sambal and fish sauce you make just about anything taste good enough to eat. Unfortunately all the sauces garnishes and prayers couldnt help me at Saigon Nites. Its not so much that its flavorless food here its just funky.I couldnt tell if my pho was rancid but it tasted that way. The appetizer sampler platter was nothing but from the box frozen selections most likely created by some giant corporation in Nebraska and intended for the frozen food section at your local grocery store. On a positive note however my tab for soup and frozen delicacies only dented my cash roll 52 bucks....WTF???',1
'I turned to A1 Minute Key Service when I needed to re-key my new house. Jeff was great speedy and sincerely concerned about doing a good job. I found them through Yelp and glad people were exceptionally telling of what a great company.',5
'Not a vegan or a vegetarian but I am a fan!  First note: if you are looking for this place pay attention to the map BEFORE you get in the car.  Its in the corner of a strip mall and is VERY easy to miss.  Its just south of McKellips for assistance.  You will see a low to the ground sign that just says GREEN.  Turn in there; the place is in the corner.  Very small very unassuming.  I tried this out because I am lactose intolerant and decided to just try eating a vegan meal to ensure no dairy was in my food.  I got the Thai Peanut and a Soynami.    The portion was large enough that I was able to split it into two bowls when I got home.  I got my Thai Peanut with brown rice and fresh tofu.  Now I already love tofu and this dish was fantastic.  Absolutely one of the best stir-fry type dishes I have had with tofu.  In fact I was surprised that 1) it was so good and 2) it was vegan.   It was the type of meal that you keep eating even though you can feel yourself getting full because its just so good.  Ditto with the soynami.  The texture was interesting which made it seem less watery than many soy based desserts that I get.  I got mine vanilla with chocolate chips and sliced almonds and it was perfect.  Another case of Im really full and should stop eating but hell with it Im already crashed out on the couch anyway...I wish you could get a half soynami because half of the Thai Peanut + half a Soynami would be a perfect meal.   I can eat a giant steak in one sitting but this meal made me go into couch potato food coma mood because I was just so...full...  In my return trips I have learned not to eat the entire bowl and to pace myself but the call of the deliciousness and the great staff keeps me coming back again and again.  I dont know if its healthy I dont know how they do it but I dont care...its delicious.  Note:  I havent tried any of the fake meat items--that just sounds weird to me...so no feedback on that. The decor is a bit odd but its one of those quirky joints you just learn to appreciate as a contributor to the local flavor category. PS: They have VIMTO!  I was seriously taken aback and laughing when I first saw this but it definitely took me back to some Middle East travels...if you love Vimto this is your place!',5
'Our server Amanda was awesome with her suggestions and service! Would go here again in a heart beat!',5
'Chipotle is one of my favorite mexican restaurants.  They offer huge burritos as well as you can skip the tortilla and get a bowl.  They also will make cheese crisps for children.  Prices are $5.50-$6.00.  You can have anything made into a salad for an additional $0.50.  They can get crowded on the weekends but you can also fax or do your order online and just pick it up.  This Chandler Mall location is nice because it allows my wife I to eat in the food court so the kids can get their favorite meal.  FYI though this is not in the food court.  It is outside by the fountains.  It is a good value because the burritos are huge.',4
'My aunt and I didnt want to drive from Scottsdale but wanted to see the Sedona. This was recommended by our hotel concierge. It was good way to see Sedona in a day.  The brochure lacked full details of the itinerary. I hate going on tours but this one was a good pick primarily because we had a fun group of fellow tourists.   Our tour guide Gina picked everyone up early around 6:30 am.She customized the tour to fit our needs. She asked if we wanted to stop at certain places which was very nice. We said yes to all her suggestions. Sedona was beautiful that my iPhone couldnt capture the red landscape perfectly. The vantage points where we stopped were breathtaking. Some of the places we saw included Red Rock Bell Rock Slide Rock Chapel of the Holy Cross and the Montezuma Castle.  It was nice learning about Arizonas history and some fun facts. Lunch was included and Wildflower Bread Company was a good pick by our tour guide. Our tour guide was well prepared with plenty of water bottles so we stay hydrated.   Unfortunately I wish there was more time to do a little souvenir shopping. Theres so much to see all in one day that I do plan to come back to Sedona for a much longer stay.',5
'Bosa has become sort of a tradition for my husband and I before we head out on a road trip. We dont eat them any other time but we always seem to end up here before taking off. I dont know if its because its early and we need the sugar to stay awake on the road or if its something about doing something out of the ordinary. Either way this is the place we come to grab a not so healthy pre road trip breakfast. This location is open 24 hours so if you were craving a doughnut at 3am you could come in and get one.  Usually we grab either a half or full dozen of the fresh doughnuts. I like the glazed kind the best but the cake ones are good as well just not my personal preference. My favorite flavors are the traditional glazed twist glazed lemon filled glazed and the apple filled crumb covered ones. My husband is a fan of all of the chocolate kinds and usually gets the long johns and custard filled doughnuts. There are a bunch of other flavors if those dont happen to tickle your fancy.  As far as doughnuts go I would say these are pretty good. I like them better than Dunkin Doughnuts and places like Safeway and whatnot. They are pretty cheap and you can also get a dozen doughnut holes for a buck. I would recommend you stop in and at least try one for yourself.  The only thing I would have to say about this place is the drive through is kind of annoying. It doesnt take very long to get in the store and get out with your goods but people will still line up around the store for the drive through which I think takes longer and blocks people from getting out of the parking lot. You are going to be eating a sugar covered dough ball. Just get out of your car and go in the store.',4
'This place really is as good as it gets.   I dont really understand how anyone can give this place any less than 5 stars.   Lets start off with walking in.....The place is great...warm and cozy beautifully decorated  very clean.   The kitchen has the open glass view so you can see the kitchen staff working.   The hostesses are very attentive along with the wait staff.  You can tell the place has great management.  And now for the food.   Its delicious.   From the appetizers to desserts this place is 5 stars.   one main thing I love about WCG is that the food is always consistent.   I hate certain places where you order something and it comes out good one time and the second time it tastes different or not as good.   Not with WCG.  Its always great.   And the desserts are to die for.  Especially the white chocolate brownie.  I read a review on here where someone said I know its the white chocolate grill but cant they have something other than white chocolate for dessert  How could you write that?  You go to a place called the white chocolate grill and your gonna complain about the white chocolate desserts?  Whats next?! are you gonna go to an italian restaurant and complain cuz they serve pasta?  Are you gonna go to a steakhouse and complain cuz they serve steaks?   Next time dont order dessert.   This place is fantastic.  Decor ambiance service and Food.   A plus!',5
'So Ive been to a which wich a few years ago in Chicago and I remember liking the caprese sandwich. I was Christmas shopping at the chandler mall and headed towards the target when my stomach started growling... I passed by the which wich and I was like whoa!!! Theres one here!  So You order by checking what you want on one if the provided paper bags. I chose the veggie and picked the caprese with Olive salad and garlic dressing. It was sooo good! I was worried it wasnt going to turn out good but it really did! I also ordered the house chips which was peppery and I liked that. All in all great experience. The staff was friendly too and clean store!',5
'When co-workers suggested that we meet here for Coffee one morning I thought they were nuts.  Coffee at a grocery store?  Well I guess judging by the long lines of people its a very popular joint.  We ordered some Coffee Muffins and some other sweet stuff (I dont know what it was they ordered it).  I had a Blueberry Muffin which was awesome.  The Coffee was some kind of Organic Ethiopian blend...it had a distinct sharp flavor to it and was pretty strong but very good.  The store part of the place was very busy and so was the dining/sitting area.  We sat in a large booth which was comfortable for 4 of us.  The absolute worse part of visiting this place is the parking.  The parking lot simply cannot handle their volume.  I had to park across the street which is a pretty busy street.....sounds like a petty thing but I wouldnt want to do it in the Summer when temps are 115+ and you have to wait for the crosswalk light.  5 Stars for the Food/Coffee 1 Star for the parking.  Return Factor - 60%',4
'I usually get a salt cheese or veggie bagel all of them are great and under a $1 if you just want it plain. I love their flavored coffee. I dont have to put a ton of milk in it I can actually drink it black...I save the calories for the bagel.  The service is always fast and friendly. Stop in I cant imagine youll be disappointed.',5
'Okay....going to be honest here.   I TRULY hate going into Home Depot stores. Cant stand em. Im always wandering around aimlessly looking for something I can never find. I always need like one small bolt or something when I go there and its always like trying to find a needle in a haystack or something for me. And you would think the employees in the orange aprons would be easy to find....but I can never find anyone for help.  Honestly....cant stand the whole Home Depot experience.   Was driving around Mesa and I was actually trying to find a Lowes. I needed some things for the house and havent had much luck finding what I needed at other stores and someone suggested I try Home Depot. My initial reaction was pretty much Ugh.....really? Sigh.....  So I thought I knew where a Lowes was but was mistaken. So I figured Id head back home and if I saw a Lowes Id stop. As luck would have it I saw this Home Depot instead.   I decided to be brave and buckle up and give it a shot. I pulled into the parking lot just knowing this was going to end in disaster like all my other Home Depot excursions.   Walked in the doors and was immediately greeted with a warm hello and a How are you doing tonight?   Um...wow....a Home Depot employee....who is friendly...and visible.  Since nature was calling....ahem.....I had to make a beeline for the restroom. Saw the sign right away....and made my way to the back of the store. On my way back TWO (!!!!!!!!!!!!!) other employees said hi and asked if I needed help.  Am I dreaming? Whats going on? Friendly ready to help Home Depot employees.....assisting me? Huh?   On the way to the restroom I walked right past what I needed. Honest.   Came out of the CLEAN restroom and went to where the item I was looking for was displayed. One of the employees who said hi to me came up and asked if I needed help.....AGAIN!!!!!!!!  She answered the questions that I had and then asked if I needed anything else. I took a shot in the dark and asked her about something else I needed. She politely escorted me to the aisle I needed and showed me the options they had available.   Dont know if this was a fluke or what. (Maybe I should have stopped and bought a lottery ticket after.) But I have to admit this was the BEST Home Depot experience Ive ever had.   I admit the store is not convenient to my house at all but if I EVER need to visit a Home Depot again I would likely consider driving out to this store. Dont know if I really would....but I would consider it.   If Im ever in Mesa and need something from a home improvement store I would definitely stop in again though.   So a big THANK YOU to this Home Depot and their friendly helpful staff for turning what I thought would be another horrifying Home Depot excursion into a delightful experience.',4
'Kids love it. Long wait at times though very frustrating.  Adding a machine may help.',2
'Awesome!  I am a high fan of this place. First of all this place is has more people than an unemployment office when its busy. I have not tried their Pizza but the Pizza looked great as I walked in line. I tried their Ice cream sandwich desert! wow! The fresh chocolate chip cookie along with vanilla ice cream was a huge compliment with my amazing iced Mocha. This place rocks! I cant wait to dine in!',4
